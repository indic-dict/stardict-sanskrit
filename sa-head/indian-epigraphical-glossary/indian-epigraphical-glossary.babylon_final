chaaTa|चाट
Cāṭa  (HD), irregular soldiers according to Fleet and Bühler. Vogel (Ant. Ch. St., pp. 130-32) points out that Chamba is the only place where the ancient word Cāṭa is still extant in the modern form Cād8 meaning ‘the head of a Parganā’. An important privilege of a gift village was ‘not to be entered by Cāṭas and Bhaṭas’. Inscriptions (Ep. Ind., Vol. XI, p. 221) often specify that the granted land was not to be entered by Cāṭas and Bhaṭas except for seizing robbers and those guilty of harm or treason to the king (cf. a-cāṭa-bhaṭa-praveśyaṁ coradrohaka-varjam in op. cit., Vol. VIII, p. 287). Sometimes we have bhaṭa-cāṭa-sevak-ādīn (Ep. Ind., Vol. IV, p. 211) and caṭṭa-bhaṭṭa-jātīyān janapadān (ibid., Vol. XIV, p. 160).

Pāiks and Piādas; a policeman leading a group of Pāiks. See caṭṭa. Yājñavalkya, I. 336, speaks of the duty of the king to protect people from the harassment caused by cāṭas, robbers and Kāyasthas and the Mitākṣarā explains cāṭa as persons who deprive people of their wealth after creating false confidence in them. According to Bṛhaspati quoted by Aparārka, ‘dangers common to all are those arising from the cāṭas and thieves’. The word cāṭa in the passage tārkika-cāṭa-bhaṭa-rājāpraveśya in Śaṅkara's Bhāsya on the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad is explained by Ānandagiri by saying that the cāṭas are those that transgress the rules of conduct for decent people and that bhaṭas are servants telling falschood (Ep. Ind., Vol. IX, p. 296). But cāṭa is used in inscriptions in the sense of a royal official.
