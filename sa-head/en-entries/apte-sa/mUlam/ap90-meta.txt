This file describes the coding conventions of the data files.
This file is encoded in utf-8 encoding.

The original digitization is file ap90_orig.txt, which is
coded in the cp1252 (windows 1252) encoding,
and is best viewed in a text editor which supports this encoding.
For example, in Emacs, one may use the command
revert-buffer-with-coding-system
and then select cp1252 as the coding.
The internet reference http://www.cp1252.com/ describes this coding system.

The file ap90_orig_utf8.txt is a conversion of ap90_orig.txt to the
more common utf-8 encoding.
(Nov 17, 2014) The file ap90_orig_utf8_slp1.txt contains the same data, but
  has Devanagari coded in SLP1 transliteration.  It is the basis of further
  corrections.
The file ap90.txt is also in the utf-8 encoding, and incorporates various
editing changes, such as corrections of typographical errors.

There are several extended ascii codes occurring in ap90.txt:
¤  (\u00a4)    73 := CURRENCY SIGN  usage unclear 
¦  (\u00a6) 31909 := BROKEN BAR
§  (\u00a7)     1 := SECTION SIGN
º  (\u00ba)  3925 := MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR
Æ  (\u00c6)     3 := LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE
×  (\u00d7)     5 := MULTIPLICATION SIGN
æ  (\u00e6)    27 := LATIN SMALL LETTER AE
œ  (\u0153)    63 := LATIN SMALL LIGATURE OE
‘  (\u2018)  2509 := LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
’  (\u2019)  2499 := RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
“  (\u201c)    31 := LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
”  (\u201d)    29 := RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
„  (\u201e)     2 := DOUBLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK
…  (\u2026)   382 := HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{# #}  116049  : {#X#} devanagari text, coded in KH transliteration
                 Nov 17, 2014. X now in SLP1 transliteration
{@X@}    137307 : bold text  There are many instances pf {#{@X@}#},
                  indicating bold devanagari text.
                  Nov 17, 2014. The coding is now {@{#X#}@}.
{%X%}     40595 : italic text 
{|X|}         5 : widely spaced text
{??}        749 : unreadable text 
Note of Sep 20, 2014:
Sampada Savardekar corrected the unreadable text. Now, there are
only 3 instances.


There is no pseudo-xml type coding.

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
In general, a page number has form [PageX+ n], where X identifies the
subsequent page and column and n is the number of lines of text on that
page and column. (for blank pages, n = 'No')
Here are the forms of X
In preface
  -I,-II
  -1 through -6
  7-a through 9-b
  10  (Here n = 'No' - a blank page)
 11-a through 13-1b
In body of text,
 PPPP-C  where PPPP is 4-digit page number (0001 - 1178)
         and C is usually 'a','b','c' but may be '1a',etc or '2a',etc.
 Occasionally, the form is 
 PPPP--C 
In Appendices, the form is as in body:
 PPPP-C  where PPPP is from 1179 to 1196

The lines of the digitization represent lines of the text.

Headword coding is exemplified by: <P>.{#hve#}¦ or <P>.{#eva#}^1¦
The general form is <P>.{#X#}¦ or <P>.{#X#}^n¦
where X (key1) is coded in Harvard-Kyoto transliteration,
and 'n' is homonym number.
Nov 17, 2014:  X is now in SLP1 transliteration.

The headwords are generally ordered according to Sanskrit alphabet ordering.

Some Sanskrit words and words in non-English languages are coded in AS coding.
The general AS scheme, as described in CDSL.pdf, uses Latin alphabetical
letters 'x (a-z,A-Z), possibly with suffixed numbers; the letter-number
combinations are, in the general scheme:
x1 = macron
x2 = dot below
x3 = dot above
x4 = accent aigu
x5 = tilde
x6 = dash below
x7 = umlaut
x10 = circonflex (hat)
x11 = accent grave

Here are the characters that occur in ap90.txt in this coding,
with their approximate frequency.  

a10  6222 := â  (\u00e2)  LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH CIRCUMFLEX
a11   932 := à  (\u00e0)  LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH GRAVE
a4   905 := á(\u00e1) LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE
d2   307 := ḍ  (\u1e0d)  LATIN SMALL LETTER D WITH DOT BELOW
e11     5 := è  (\u00e8)  LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH GRAVE
e4     5 := é  (\u00e9)  LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE
i10  1579 := î  (\u00ee)  LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH CIRCUMFLEX
i11      8 := ì  (\u00ec)  LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH GRAVE
i3     1 :=  probable error in text. Not a diacritic
i4    15 := í (\u00ed) LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH ACUTE
n2  3027 := ṇ  (\u1e47)  LATIN SMALL LETTER N WITH DOT BELOW
o7     4 := ö  (\u00f6)  LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS (in Preface)
r2   592 := ṛ  (\u1e5b)  LATIN SMALL LETTER R WITH DOT BELOW
t2   298 := ṭ  (\u1e6d)  LATIN SMALL LETTER T WITH DOT BELOW
u10   440 := ū  (\u016b)  LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH MACRON
u11    11 := ù  (\u00f9)  LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH GRAVE
u4    12 := ú (\u00fa) LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH ACUTE
u7     4 := ü  (\u00fc)  LATIN SMALL LETTER U WITH DIAERESIS

A0     1 := continuation in Devanagari
a0     1 := continuation in Devanagari
i0     2 := continuation in Devanagari
o0     2 := continuation in Devanagari

For Sanskrit words written in Indological form, long vowels are generally
written with a circumflex diacritic, rather than the currently more common
macron.  In the scanned images, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish
between a grave diacritic and a circumflex diacritic. Thus, some of the 
codings of a11, e11, i11, u11 may need to be changed to a10, etc.
