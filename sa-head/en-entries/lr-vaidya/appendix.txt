AN EXPLANATORY VOCABULARY OF THE NAMES OF NOTED MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONS, &c.
------------------------------------
अक्रूर
--Son of Śvaphalka and Gandhinī, who took possession of the celebrated <i>Śyamantaka</i> jewel from Śatadhanvan when the latter was pursued by Kṛishṇa. When Kṛishṇa discovered that the precious jewel was in Akrūra’s possession, he desired him to retain it. Akrūra then wore it publicly. It was he who conveyed Kṛishṇa and Balarāma to Mathurā where Kṛishṇa performed some of his great exploits.

अगस्त्य
--A great sage said to have been born of Mitrā and Varuṇa in a water-jar (hence called कुम्भोद्भव, कुम्भयोनि). He is regarded as the pioneer of Āryan civilization in the South. Rāma who was his guest for some time was treated by him with the most distinguished tokens of respect and was presented with the bow of Vishṇu, two inexhaustible quivers and a superb coat of mail which had been given to the sage by Indra. The Vindhya mountain once grew jealous and demanded that the sun should revolve round him. This the sun declining to do, the Vindhya elevated himself higher and higher in order to obstruct the passage of the sun and the moon. The gods, alarmed, sought the aid of Agastya. The latter approached the mountain and requested him to lend down and afford him passage to the south, begging at the same time that the mountain would retain a low position till his return. This the mountain promised to do, but Agastya never returned and the Vindhya never attained the height of Himālaya. Agastya is known for having drunk the whole sea and for having eaten up and digested two demons of the names of आतापि and वातापि; owing to the latter incident his name is believed to have a digesting effect on the stomach. He is considered as the regent of the star <i>Canopus</i> in the south, and it is believed that his appearance in the sky makes turbid waters clear, (/R./iv.21, xiii.36).

अग्नि
--(fire personified) Son of Kaśyapa and Aditi. He is generally described as having two faces, three legs and seven arms or tongues (flames) and riding a ram or borne in a carriage drawn by red horses. Svāhā is his wife and Pāvaka, Pavamāna and Śuchi are his sons. He gave the <i>Gāndīva</i> to Arjuna.

अघ
--A demon in the service of Kansa. He assumed the form of a vast serpent to devour Kṛishṇa’s companions, but was killed by the latter.

अंगद
--Son of Vāli, a monkey-king, and Tārā. He was one of the chief monkeys in Rāma’s force, and was sent out on an embassy to Lankā. His expostulations with Rāvaṇa are a piece of the most stirring and persuasive eloquence.

अज
--Son of Raghu and father of Daśaratha. Kālidāsa describes in glowing terms the life of Aja, particularly his marriage with Indumatī, a princess of the Bhojas, and his lamentations at her unexpected death.

अजमीढ
--An ancestor of Yudhishṭhira.

अजामिल
--A Brāhmaṇa of Kanyākubja, who was attached to a Śūdra woman and her children. While calling out his son named Nārāyaṇa, he heard the conversation of the servants of Yama and Vishṇu and repented.

अंजना
--The wife of a monkey, named Kesari, and the mother of Hanūmat, the celebrated monkey-chieftain of Rāma. She is said to have been impregnated by the desire of Marut, hence the name Māruti (the wind-born).

अत्रि
--A Prajāpati or progenitor. He was married to Anasūya and was the father of Dattātreya. The moon is said to have been produced from his eye, (/R./ii.75). In Rāma’s peregrinations through the Danḍaka forest, the sage entertained him at his hermitage, and his wife blessed Sītā with a pigment which never wore out and was proof against any inclemency of weather. As a Ṛishi, he is one of the stars of the <i>Great Bear</i>.

He was secretly conveyed during night to Ushā’s room, which was rigidly sentinelled, by the magical power of Chitralekhā, friend of Ushā. After a time, he was detected and reported to Bāṇa. A fierce fight ensued between Bāṇa and him. But he proved invincible. Bāṇa, foiled in his attempt of subduing him with arms, contrived his capture by means of his magical faculties. Aniruddha was freed from his captivity by Kṛishṇa who utterly defeated Bāṇa and humbled him down.

अंधक
--A demon with thousand heads and arms, killed by Śiva as he attempted to carry off the <i>Pārijāta</i> tree from the heaven.

अभिमन्यु
--Son of Arjuna by Subhadrā, renowned for his strength and valour. He was married to Uttarā, the daughter of king Virāṭa. He fought with distinguished valour on thc first day of the great war, cutting down the ensign in Bhīshma’s chariot. On the second day, he slew a son of Duryodhana and when attacked by the latter was rescued by Arjuna. On the thirteenth day of the war, he was, owing to the absence of Arjuna, commanded by Yudhishṭhira to charge the Kauravas who were drawn up in the form of a spider’s web; he drove his chariot into the enemies’ ranks and performed prodigies of valour, but was finally conquered by six warriors and slain, (/Ve./ii.). After the great war, the line of the Pānḍavas was preserved through his son Parīkshit.

अंबरीष
--Son of king Nābhāga, was greatly distinguished for his piety and liberality. He is said to have conquered the whole world in a week.

अंबा
--The eldest daughter of Kāsīrāja. She along with her two sisters was won by Bhīshma as prize in the contest which took place at the time of her <i>Svayamvara</i>. Ambā with her sisters was to be married to Vichitravīrya, the step-brother of Bhīshma; but she refused to marry him saying that she had already taken in her mind king Śālva for her lord. She was allowed to go to Śālva; but on suing him she found to her utter disappointment that her suit was rejected by that prince. Thus repulsed she returned to Bhīshma and importuned him to espouse her, but he would not do so for fear of violating the vow of life-long continence to which he had strictly sworn before his father. She then returned into a forest for observing penance. There one day she fell in with her grand-father who pitied her condition, and taking her to his friend Paraśurāma, requested him to persuade Bhīshma to marry her. Paraśurāma closed with the proposal and took her to Bhīshma but found him untractable. Then followed a trial by combat between the two warriors, but there was no decision. In her helplessness Ambā propitiated Śiva and begged him to furnish her with the means of killing Bhīshma. But this was not possible in that very birth, and the god said that she could have her revenge in her second birth which would be that of a daughter of king Drupada named Śikhanḍinī. Consoled by this promise she quitted the world, was again born as the daughter of Drupada and afterwards became Arjuna’s instrument of killing Bhīshma. See शिखंडिन्.

अम्बिका, अम्बालिका
--Younger sisters of Ambā. They (both of them) were married to Vichitravīrya, but he died before either of them had borne any child to him. Witnessing this utter failure of issue in them, Satyavatī, their mother-in-law, summoned Vyāsa, her eldest son, from the forest who, at her request, begot Dhṛitarāshṭra and Pānḍu respectively on Ambikā and Ambālikā.

अरुण
--The charioteer of the sun and the-son of Kaśyapa and Vinatā. Being prematurely delivered, he is said to have been born thighless. He is the brother of Garuḍa and the father of Jaṭāyu.

अरुन्धती
--Daughter of Kardama and wife of Vasishṭha. “One of the Pleiades and generally regarded as the model of wifely excellence.” Hence the star of this name, which is close to the middle one in the tail of <i>Ursa Major</i>, is pointed out by the bridegroom to his bride, with admonitions to pay obeisance to it, at the marriage ceremony.

अर्जुन
--The third son of Pānḍu and Kuntī, begotten on the latter by Indra. Arjuna was the most favourite pupil of Droṇa. At the <i>Svayamvara</i> of Draupadī, he succeeded in hitting the golden fish and won Draupadī who became the wife of the five brothers. There was a rule among the brothers that if any one of them entered the house of another brother while Draupadī was dwelling there, he should go into exile for twelve years. Arjuna happened to break this rule and had to go into exile in consequence. While thus wandering abroad, he married Ulūpī, Chitrāngadā and Subhadrā. In the course of the exile of the Pānḍavas, Arjuna secured the Pāśupata missile from Śiva with whom, disguised as a Kirāta, he had a severe fight. He was the bravest of the Pānḍavas and the central figure of attraction in the great war with the Kauravas. He killed two of the greatest warriors on the other side, Bhīshma and Karṇa. His next adventures were in connection with the horse-sacrifice performed by Yudhishṭhira. After the massacre at Prabhāsa, he with the other Pānḍavas perished on the Himālaya mountain. Parīkshit, his grand-son, succeeding to the throne of Hastināpura.

अश्वत्थामन्
--The only son of Droṇa, the military preceptor of the Kauravas and Pānḍavas, and Kṛipī, the sister Kṛipa. He is said to be deathless. In the course of the great war between the Kauravas and the Pānḍavas, one day an elephant, named Aśvatthāman, was slain and the Pānḍavas, by the advice of Kṛishṇa, took advantage of this coincidence in name and falsely reported that Droṇa’s son was dead. Yudhishṭhira was appealed to as being truthful and had to give an evasive reply. Overcome with sorrow at the early death of his only son, the kind old father was for a time insensible. Meanwhile Dhṛishṭadyumna, his avowed enemy, severed his head from the body, (/Ve./iii.). Of all this, Aśvatthāman had no knowledge till the treacherous deed was accomplished. When he heard of it, he was overcome with filial tenderness and in a fit of paroxism upbraided for their pusillanimity all the warriors of his side who witnessed with indifference his father’s death. Aśvatthāman afterwards took his revenge by murdering the five sons of Draupadī, while asleep, and also Dṛishṭadyumna and is believed to be still living, being a चिरंजीविन्.

अश्विनीकुमार
--The twin sons of the sun by his wife संज्ञा in the form of a mare. Once it happened that संज्ञा wanted to go to her father’s house; but her husband would not allow her to go. Through her magical power, she then created a woman, an exact likeness of herself, and substituting her in her place without her husband’s knowledge, went to her father. The sun refused to admit her when she returned. Thus repulsed she assumed the form of a mare, and wandered over the earth. After some time by some domestic discord, the sun came to know all this, assumed the form of a horse and was with his wife, now a mare, who bore to him these twins. The Aśvins are famous as heavenly physicians.

इन्द्र
--The king of heaven and lord of the gods. It is supposed that any body, a god, a man, or a giant, can raise himself to the position of Indra by performing a hundred horse-sacrifices. Indra is, therefore, represented as being jealous of one who performs one hundred sacrifices and as trying to dissuade him from his object either personally or by the intervention of the nymphs of his court, (/R./iii.). He is known as the paramour of Ahalyā, the wife of Gautama, whom he once ravished. Gautama’s curse on this account produced hundreds of sores in the body of Indra but these were afterwards changed into so many eyes (सहस्रनेत्र). He is described to have stolen the horse consecrated by king Sagara, who was about to perform the horse-sacrifice for the hundredth time. He is said to have killed Vṛitra and Bala. The former of these was a Brāhmaṇa and Indra had to sacrifice till he purged away his sin. It was he who cut down the wings of the mountains that once flew about to the great annoyance of the people. He is the god of rain.

इन्द्रजित्
--The bravest and most powerful of the sons of Rāvaṇa. By means of magical weapons, in the use of which he was an expert, he inflicted terrible wounds on all the leaders of Rāma’s army, especially on Lakshmaṇa whom he left almost dead on the field. Lakshmaṇa recovered by means of the healing plants brought specially for that purpose by Hanūmat and ultimately killed Indrajit. Indrajit’s original name was Meghanāda but he was so called because he captured Indra and brought him to Lankā.

उग्रसेन
--The king of Mathurā who was deposed by his son Kansa and kept in confinement. When Kansa was killed, Kṛishṇa restored the captive king to the throne and sent to Indra for his royal hall <i>Sudharman</i> which was convoyed from heaven by Vāyu and used by the Yādava chiefs.

Subsequently for political reasons, the minister brought about his marriage with Padmāvati, the daughter of Pradyota, king of Magadha who, believing the false report that Vāsavadattā was burnt to death, gave his consent to the marriage.

While descending, she saw king Purūravas and, as she saw him, she forgot all reserve and disregarding the delights of <i>Svarga</i>, became deeply enamoured of the prince. She abode with him for a while and at the expiration of her curse again went to heaven. The king mourned her loss heavily and had the good fortune of seeing his heavenly bride once more. She bore a son to Purūravas before she left him. (The account in the Vikramorvaśīya varies.) See पुरूरवस्.

उलूपी
--The daughter of the serpent Kauravya. One day, while Arjuna was bathing in the river Ganges, Ulūpī happened to see him and was quite taken with his manly beauty. She stole him away to Pātāla and there persuaded him to take her hand to which, Arjuna, after some hesitation, consented. From him she had one son named Irāvān.

उषा
--the daughter of Bāṇa, who saw Aniruddha in a dream and became enamoured of him. She related this to Chitralekhā, her female confidante, who advised the employment of a portrait-painter to take the portrait of all the young princes in the neighbourhood. On seeing the portrait of Aniruddha, Ushā recognized him. Chitralekhā then clandestinely united the youth to Ushā. (See अनिरुद्ध.)

ऋतुपर्ण
--The son of Ayutāyu, a descendant of Ikshvāku. He was celebrated for his skill in dice. He was a great friend of king Nala with whom he exchanged his skill in dice for his knowledge of horsemanship. Nala in the days of his adversity found shelter in the service of this king at Ayodhyā.

ऋष्यशृंग
--A great sage. He was the son of Vibhānḍaka and a heavenly nymph in the shape of a deer. He was brought up in the forest by his father and saw no other human being until he attained early manhood. At a season of great drought Lomapāda, king of Anga, by the advice of Brāhmaṇas, allured Ṛishyasṛinga to his house and with great ceremony gave his daughter Śāntā in marriage to him. The sage, satisfied with that gift, caused heavy showers to fall in his kingdom. He was subsequently called by Daśaratha to perform for him a sacrifice for the attainment of issue.

और्य
--(the submarine fire) The son of Urva and the grand-son of Bhṛigu. He is said to have been born from the thigh and at the persuasion of Pitṛis is to have cast the fire of his anger, against the <i>Kshatriyas</i> who persecuted his race into the ocean where it became a being with the face of a horse. He was the preceptor of Sagar.

कंस
--King of Mathurā who incarcerated his father. He slew the first six children of his cousin Devakī, the wife of Vasudeva, and mother of Kṛishṇa. But the seventh and the eighth, Balarāma and Kṛishṇa, escaped his circumspection. He was warned before the birth of Kṛishṇa that the latter would take his life. He accordingly attempted to kill Kṛishṇa as soon as he was born. Failing in this, he employed many demons to accomplish his purpose, and sent Akrūra to bring Kṛishṇa to Mathurā where a severe duel was fought between Kṛishṇa and Kansa in which the former slew the latter.

ककुत्स्थ
--The grand-son of Ikshvāku. In a war between the demons and the gods, this king was called by Indra to his assistance. The king agreed to lend his assistance on condition that Indra should carry him on his shoulders assuming the form of a bull.

Tbe demons were angry that their preceptor should teach the son of Bṛihaspati. They thrice killed him and Śukra, pressed by his daughter, thrice restored him to life.

He was found by Dhṛitarāshṭra’s charioteer Adhiratha and nurtured by his wife Rādhā whence he was called राधेय. When grown up, he became king of the Angas and was proverbially the type of charity. Taking advantage of this, Indra asked from him his impenetrable celestial panoply and ear-rings in the guise of a Brāhmaṇa. Karṇa went to Paraśurāma and, simulating himself a Brāhmaṇa, learnt from him the military art. But once while Paraśurāma was sleeping with his head on Karṇa’s lap, a worm made its way into it and as Karṇa put up with it patiently, he was discovered and cursed that his art would not be useful to him in war. On another occasion, he was cursed that the wheel of his chariot would sink down into the earth in the hour of trial. Karṇa was the most intimate friend of Duryodhana and joined him and Śakuni in their various schemes of destroying the Pānḍavas.

--Son of Śiva, generated from the semen of that god cast into <i>Agni</i>, who, too weak to retain it, cast it into the Ganges.

Thence it was swallowed by the six Kṛittikās, every one of whom, produced a male child. But these six children, born severally, were combined into one of abnormal figure with six heads and twelve hands ; (hence called कार्तिकेय and षण्मुख). He was the commander of the army of the gods (hence called सेनानी), and slew the powerful demon Tāraka (q.v.). Devasenā was his wife.

He requested Vasishṭha and his hundred sons to perform for him a sacrifice that would enable him to go to heaven in his cherished body. When this absurd proposal was rejected by them, he charged the sages with impotency and was,, in return for these indignities, degraded by them to be a <i>chānḍāla</i>. Viśvāmitra, however, celebrated the sacrifice for him in return for his past services. However, when the sacrifice was completed, the gods themselves paid no heed to it. Viśvāmitra, in a rage, caused Triśanku to mount up into heaven with his earthly body by the potency of his severe penance. Triśanku began to soar, but when his head struck against the celestial azure, Indra, looking over, said “fall Triśanku”; and the unhappy monarch began to fall, but was arrested by the voice of Viśvāmitra when half way between heaven and earth where the body of the monarch still remains.

The lovely pair passed some years very happily. In course of time, however, Nala in an inauspicious hour, was induced to play at dice with his brother Pushkara and staked every thing except his wife and himself. The ill-fated pair was then driven into wilderness all but naked. There with her husband Damayantī passed through a series of strange adventures, all the while remaining strictly faithful to her lord.

After some time, however, she and Nala were brought together and passed the rest of their lives happily.

The king was extremely fond of his sons and when Kaikeyī demanded the exile of Rāma by a boon promised to her before, he tried to dissuade her from her purpose by the most abject entreaties. Seeing that they had no effect, he complied with the demand but ended his life in sorrow and lamentation. See कैकेयी and राम.

They then lived at Indraprastha where they celebrated the Rājasūya sacrifice with great splendour. But their escape and wealth revived the jealousy of Duryodhana and he now continued to persuade Yudhishṭhira to play with dice. In that game the latter staked everything not excluding his wife and was forced to go to the forest with his wife and brothers for twelve years and to live hidden for one year. After the expiration of the stated period the hostilities were renewed and the great <i>Bhāratī</i> war which lasted for eighteen days and ended in the thorough extermination of the Kauravas was fought.

Leaving her there, he went back to his capital. After a time, Śakuntalā was delivered of a son and was sent to him with the child. But the king denied all knowledge of having ever seen her.

See ययाति.

--King of the Pānchālas, father of Draupadī. He was a school-fellow of Droṇa, whom he once offended him by repudiating his friendship.

धृष्टद्युम्न
--Son of Drupada and brother of Draupadī. At the beginning of the great war, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Pānḍava forces.

His father in his old age desired to marry a young and beautiful damsel, but her parents refused to give her to him, on the ground that her sons would not succeed to the throne, Bhīshma being the rightful heir. In order to please his father, Bhīshma made a vow to the parents of the damsel that he would never accept the kingdom or marry a wife or become the father of children by any woman. His name is traced to this “terrible vow.” Bhīshma, henceforth, became the patriarch of the family and is represented as a model of faithfulness and loyalty. He installed his brother Vichitravīrya on the throne, got him married (See अंबा) and brought up his sons and grand-sons. He was mortally disabled by Śikhanḍin or rather by Arjuna in the <i>Bhāratī</i> war, but having the power of fixing the period of his death, he lived till the sun had crossed the vernal equinox.

भूरिश्रवस्
--A warrior who fought on the side of the Kauravas in the great war and was slain by Sātyaki.

भृगु
--An ancestor of Paraśurāma. At the request of other <i>Ṛishis</i>, he went out to test the characters of various gods. He first went to Śiva, and not getting an interview, cursed him to take the form of a <i>Linga</i>. He next went to Brahman (m.), but being received with great indifference, declared that the deity should receive no worship or offerings. Lastly he went to Vishṇu but finding him asleep kicked him on the breast. Instead of being offended, Vishṇu pressed his feet gently and declared himself honoured by the treatment. Bhṛigu consequently declared him to be the only deity entitled to the worship of gods and men.

मंथरा
--An old female servant who persuaded Kaikeyī to secure the throne of Ayodhyā to Bharata, her own son, and to send Rāma into exile.

मंदोदरी

--Son of Māndhātṛi. He once assisted the gods in fight and secured from them, as a boon, long sleep and the instant death of him who would disturb it. By a strategem of Kṛishṇa, Kālayavana was led to rouse Muchukunda and fell a victim to his wrath.

--Son of Nahusha. He married Devayānī, daughter of Śukra and subsequently Śarmishṭhā, the daughter of Vṛishaparvan, who was ordered by her father to attend on Devayānī as a servant for the offence she had given to the latter. (See देवयानी). Through the curse of Śukra, Yayāti became old and infirm before his time, but having appeased his father-in-law he obtained permission to transfer his decrepitude to any one who would consent to take it. Out of his five sons, Puru respectfully complied with his father’s desire. The king, now endowed with renovated youth, passed this time in the enjoyment of pleasures. A thousand years passed in this way, and still he could conceive no end to his desires. The more they were gratified, the more ardent they became. Seeing this, the king suddenly renounced all sensual enjoyment and fixed his mind upon spiritual truth. He restored his youth to Puru, resumed his own decrepitude and departed to the wood of penance.

यशोदा
--The foster-mother of Kṛishṇa.

युधिष्ठिर
--The eldest Pānḍava prince begotten on Kuntī by Dharma (यम). He was more distinguished for piety and truthfulness than for military exploits. Dhṛitarāshṭra installed him king at Vāraṇāvata to avoid the jealousy of his sons. At this place, an attempt was made to burn him and his brothers alive; but they escaped and removed to Indraprastha. Here the Pānḍavas established their supremacy and performed the Rājasūya sacrifice. This excited the jealousy of Duryodhana who arranged for Dharma’s visit to a gambling match at Hastināpura. Through the treacherous contrivances of Duryodhana and Śakuni, Dharma lost every thing and had to go into exile with his wife and brothers. After thirteen years of great trouble, the Pānḍavas opened negotiations for the partition of the kingdom, and being unsuccessful undertook the great <i>Bhāratī</i> war. After eighteen days of severe fighting, in the course of which the Kauravas were all slain, Yudhishṭhira was crowned emperor of Hastināpura and reigned justly and wisely for many years. (Also called धर्म.)

राम
--Son of Daśaratha by Kausalyā, the hero of the great epic Rāmāyaṇa. When it was proposed to install Rāma as <i>yuvarāja</i>, Kaikeyi, at the instigation of Mantharā, insisted, by the two boons previously promised to her by the king, on the exile of Rāma and the installation of Bharata as <i>yuvarāja</i>. The old king was shocked at this unexpected request and tried his best to dissuade his wife from her evil intentions, but she proved inexorable. At last Rāma, to fulfil the word of his father, willingly went into exile accompanied by his young and beautiful wife Sītā and his brother Lakshmaṇa. While in forest, Sītā was carried off by Rāvaṇa, king of Lankā. Rāma, assisted by numerous monkeys, built a bridge across the ocean, conquered Lankā, slew Rāvaṇa and recovered his wife. At the expiration of the stated period of exile, he returned to Ayodhya and reigned for a longtime, justly, happily and peacefully. He is believed to be the seventh incarnation of Vishṇu.

रावण
--A celebrated demon, king of Lankā who recovered that city from his half-brother Kuvera and peopled it with his own relations, the <i>Rākshasas</i>. (See विश्रवस् and माल्यवत्). He had ten heads and twenty arms (and also four legs in infancy, /R./xii.88) and had the power of assuming any form at will. In his attempt to propitiate Brahman (n.), he is said to have cut off all his heads but one, when the deity was pleased. He was the most powerful king of his day. Even the gods yielded to his power and were almost enslaved by him. He once attempted to uproot the Kailasa mountain, but Śiva pressed it down and crushed the demon’s hands under it; from this calamity he was relieved only by propitiating that deity. His character is described as libidinous and cruel. In consequence of his having abducted Sītā, Rāma invaded Lankā and killed him in fight.

राहु
--A demon, son of Viprachitti and Sinhikā. When Amṛita was being served to gods, he attempted to partake of it; but the sun and the moon detected him and Vishṇu cut off his head. However, having tasted a little of it, he became immortal and wreaks his vengeance on the sun and the moon by occasionally swallowing them, (/Bhartr./ii.34). In astronomy, Rahu and Ketu are regarded as names for the ascending and descending nodes.

रुक्मिणी

Sītā, when repudiated by her husband, took refuge with this sage who brought up her twin sons.

At this announcement, Nārada who happened to be present told her and her father that she would choose grief and misery in choosing Satyavat, as he was fated to die in a year counting from that day. But the high-souled maiden could on no account be put off her purpose and in due time the young couple were married. Sāvitrī put aside her jewels and wore the coarse raiment of hermits.//“Sadly, sadly as she counted, day by day flew swiftly by, //“And the fated time came nearer when her Satyavān must die,//“Yet three days and he must perish, sadly thought the loving wife,//“And she vowed to fast, unresting, for his last three days of life.”//She maintained her fast and on the third day, when her husband went out to perform his daily task of felling trees, she accompanied him. Fatigued by work Satyavat rested his head upon his wife’s breast and fell asleep. In the meantime Yama deprived him of his soul in the presence of Sāvitrī and moved towards the south. Sāvitrī closely followed him and could not be induced to return without Satyavat. At length, love conquered death and Yama, relenting, restored to her her husband’s spirit. Sāvitrī is regarded as the highest type of conjugal fidelity and her example is held out to every daughter of India for imitation.
