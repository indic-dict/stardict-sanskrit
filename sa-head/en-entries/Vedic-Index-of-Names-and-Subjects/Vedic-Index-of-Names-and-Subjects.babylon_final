aMshu|अंशु
अंशु<BR> --I. Name of a protégé of the Aśvins in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 5, 26. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 89; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 129, suggests that he may be identical with Khela. 2. Dhānaṃjayya, pupil of Amāvāsya Śāṇḍilyāyana, according to the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 2) Indische Studien, 4, 373.

aMhasaspati|अंहसस्पति
अंहसस्-पति<BR> --This is the name of the intercalary month in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (vii. 30; xxii. 31). See Māsa.

akra|अक्र
अक्र<BR> --In several passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 143, 7; 189, 7; iii. 1, 12; iv. 6, 3; x. 77, 2. this word means, according to Geldner, 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 168, 169. ‘horse.’ Roth 3) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 118. Cf. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 414. suggests that ‘riding horse’ is the precise sense. Cf. Aśva.

axa|अक्ष
1. Akṣa, ‘axle,’ is a part of a chariot often referred to in the Rigveda 1) i. 30, 14; 166, 9; iii. 53, 17; vi. 24, 3; x. 89; 4, etc. and later. It was apparently 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 246. fastened to the body of the chariot (Kośa) by straps (akṣā-nah, lit. ‘tied to the axle,’ though this word is also 3) Rv. x. 53, 7. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. rendered ‘horse’). The heating of the axle and the danger of its breaking were known. 4) Rv. i. 164, 13. The part of the axle round which the nave of the wheel revolved was called Āṇi, ‘pin.’ 

axa|अक्ष
2. Akṣa.<BR> --This word occurs frequently, from the Rigveda onwards, both in the singular and plural, meaning ‘die’ and ‘dice.’ Dicing, along with horse-racing, was one of the main amusements of the Vedic Indian; but, despite the frequent mention of the game in the literature, there is considerable difficulty in obtaining any clear picture of the mode in which it was played. (1) The Material.--The dice appear normally to have been made of Vibhīdaka nuts. Such dice are alluded to in both the Rigveda 1) vii. 86, 6; x. 34, 1. and the Atharvaveda, 2) Av. Paipp. xx. 4, 6. hence being called ‘brown’ (babhru), and ‘born on a windy spot.’ 3) Rv. x. 34, 5; Av. vii. 114, 7; Rv. x. 34, 1. In the ritual game of dice at the Agnyādheya and the Rājasūya ceremonies the material of the dice is not specified, but it is possible that occasionally gold imitations of Vibhīdaka nuts were used. 4) Sāyaṇa on Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 6, 12; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 4, 6. There is no clear trace in the Vedic literature of the later use of cowries as dice. 5) Sāyaṇa, loc. cit., and on Rv. i. 41, 9; Mahīdhara on Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 28. (2) The Number.--In the Rigveda 6) x. 34, 12. the dicer is described as ‘leader of a great horde’ (senānīr mahato gaṇasya), and in another passage 7) x. 34, 8. the number is given as tri-pañcāśaḥ, an expression which has been variously interpreted. Ludwig, 8) See his translation. Weber, 9) U7ber das Rājāsūya, 72. and Zimmer 10) Altindisches Leben, 284. render it as fifteen, which is grammatically hardly possible. Roth 11) Following Sāyaṇa on Rv. x. 34, 8. and Grassmann 12) In his translation. render it as ‘consisting of fifty-three.’ Lüders 13) Das Würfelspiel im alten Indien, 25. takes it as ‘consisting of one hundred and fifty,’ but he points out that this may be merely a vague expression for a large number. For a small number Zimmer 14) Op. cit., 283. cites a reference in the Rigveda 15) i. 41, 9. to one who fears ‘him who holds four’ (caturaś cid dadamānāt), but the sense of that passage is dependent on the view taken of the method of playing the game. (3) The Method of Play.--In several passages of the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas lists are given of expressions connected with dicing. The names are Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara, Āskanda, and Abhibhū in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 16) iv. 3, 3, 1. 2. In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 17) xxx. 18. among the victims at the Puruṣamedha, the kitava is offered to the Akṣarāja, the ādinava-darśa to the Kṛta, the kalpin to the Tretā, the adhi-kalpin to the Dvāpara, the sabhā-sthāṇu to the Āskanda. The lists in the parallel version of the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa are kitava, sabhāvin, ādinavadarśa, bahiḥ-sad, and sabhā-sthāṇu, 18) iii. 4, 1, 16. These must be persons conversant with dicing, but the exact sense of the names is unknown. and Aksarāja, Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara, and Kali. From the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 19) v. 4, 4, 6. it appears that another name of Kali was Abhibhū, and the parallel lists in the Taittirīya and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitās suggest that Abhibhū and Akṣarāja are identical, though both appear in the late Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa list. The names of some of these throws go back even to the Rigveda and the Atharvaveda. Kali occurs in the latter, 20) vii. 114, 1. and Lüders 21) Op. cit., 43 et seq, shows that in a considerable number of passages in the former Kṛta means a ‘throw’ (not ‘a stake’ 22) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. or ‘what is won’ 23) Grassmann's Dictionary, s.v. and this sense is clearly found in the Atharvaveda. 24) vii. 52. See Rv. x. 42, 9 (kṛtaṃ vicinoti); 43, 5; x. 102, 2; v. 60, 1; ix. 97, 58; i. 132, 1; x. 34, 6; i. 100, 9; viii. 19, 10. Moreover, that there were more throws (ayāḥ) than one is proved by a passage in the Rigveda, 25) x. 116, 9. when the gods are compared to throws as giving or destroying wealth. The nature of the throws is obscure. The St. Petersburg Dictionary conjectures that the names given above were applied either to dice marked 4, 3, 2, or 1, or to the sides of the dice so marked, and the latter interpretation is supported by some late commentators. 26) Ānandagiri on Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 1, 4; Nīlakaṇṭha on Mahābhārata, iv. 50, 24. But there is no evidence for the former interpretation, and, as regards the latter, the shape of the Vibhīdaka nuts, 27) Lüders, op. cit., 18. used as dice, forbids any side being properly on the top. Light is thrown on the expressions by the descrip tion of a ritual game 28) Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ii. 8; 9; Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, v, 19, 4; 20, 1, with Rudradatta's note, for the Agnyādheya. Āpastamba, xviii. 18, 16 st seq., describes the Rājasūya game, and cf. Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 6; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 10, 5; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 4, 6; Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, xv. 7, 5 et seq. For Kṛta as four, see Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 2, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 11, 1. at the Agnyādheya and at the Rājasūya ceremonies. The details are not certain, 29) See Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 62, 123 et seq. but it is clear that the game consisted in securing even numbers of dice, usually a number divisible by four, the Kṛta, the other three throws then being the Tretā, when three remained over after division by four; the Dvāpara, when two was the remainder; and the Kali, when one remained. If five were the dividing number, then the throw which showed no remainder was Kali, the Kṛta was that when four was left, and so on. The dice had no numerals marked on them, the only question being what was the total number of the dice themselves. There is no reason to doubt that the game as played in the Rigveda was based on the same principle, though the details must remain doubtful. The number of dice used was certainly large, 30) Rv. x. 34, 8. and the reference to throwing fours, 31) Rv. i. 41, 9. In x. 34, 2, the loss is ascribed to akṣasya ekaparasya, which confirms the explanation of Dvāpara given in Pāṇiṇi, ii. 1, 10. and losing by one, points to the use of the Kṛta as the winning throw. The Atharvaveda, 32) vii. 114, 1. on the other hand, possibly knew of the Kali as the winning throw. In one respect the ordinary game must have differed from the ritual game. In the latter the players merely pick out the number of dice required--no doubt to avoid ominous errors, such as must have happened if a real game had been played. In the secular game the dice were thrown, 33) Rv. x. 34, 1. 8. 9; Av. iv. 38, 3. perhaps on the principle suggested by Lüders: 34) Op. cit. 56. the one throwing a certain number on the place of playing, and the other then throwing a number to make up with those already thrown a multiple of four or five. This theory, at any rate, accounts for the later stress laid on the power of computation in a player, as in the Nala. No board appears to have been used, but a depression on which the dice were thrown (adhi-devana, devana, 35) Adhidevana in Av. v. 31, 6; vi. 70, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā; i. 6, 11; iv. 4, 6, etc.; devana in Rv. x. 43, 5. The falling of the dice on the ground is referred to in Av. vii. 114, 2. iriṇa 36) Rv. x. 34, 1. ), was made in the ground. No dice box was used, but reference is made to a case for keeping dice in (akṣa-vapana 37) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 1, 11. The throw was called graha 38) Av. iv. 38, 1 et seq.; cf. vii. 114, 5. or earlier grābha. 39) Rv. viii. 81, 1; ix. 106, 3. The stake is called vij. 40) Rv. i. 92, 10; ii. 12, 5; lakṣa in ii. 12, 4, and often dhana. So Lüders, op. cit., 10, n. 5; 62, n. 1. Roth and Zimmer, op. cit., 286, render ‘he makes the dice secretly disappear’ (i. 92, 10). Serious losses could be made at dicing: in the Rigveda a dicer laments the loss of all his property, including his wife. 41) Rv. x. 34, 2. For cheating at play cf. Rv. v, 85, 8; vii. 86, 6; 104 14; Av. vi. 118. Lüders 42) Op. cit., 61. finds a different form of the game referred to in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 43) iv. 1, 4; 6. According to Nīlakaṇṭha on Harivaṃśa, ii. 61, 39, the stake was divided into ten parts, and the Kali then took one, the Dvāpara three, the Tretā six, and the Kṛta all ten. This explanation seems harsh. Cf. Roth, Gurupūjākaumudī, 1-4; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 283-287; Lüders, Das Würfelspiel im alten Indien; Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 62, 123 et seq.; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 823 et seq.

axa|अक्ष
3. Akṣa.<BR> --In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (vii. 3, 1) this word seems to denote the nut of the Vibhīdaka (Terminalia bellerica).

axata|अक्षत
अक्षत<BR> or Akṣita.--In one passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) vii. 76, 4. dealing with the Jāyānya, mention is made of a remedy for sores designated both Akṣita and Sukṣata, or, according to the reading of the Kauṣika Sūtra, Akṣata and Sukṣata, while Sāyaṇa has Akṣita and Sukṣita. Bloomfield 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 17, 562. renders ‘not caused by cutting’ and ‘caused by cutting.’ Formerly 3) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, cxvii. et seq. he suggested ‘tumour’ or ‘boil.’ Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda 442. thinks that two varieties of Jāyānya are meant. Ludwig 5) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 500. reads with Sāyana akṣita, which he renders by ‘not firmly established’ in the invalid. Zimmer 6) Altindisches Leben, 377. finds in it a disease Kṣata. 

axaavapana|अक्षावपन
अक्षा-वपन<BR> See Akṣa.

axu|अक्षु
अक्षु<BR> --The word occurs in two passages of the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 8, 18 (akṣujālābhyām); ix. 3, 18. and one of the Rigveda. 2) i. 180, 5. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. renders it by ‘net,’ while Böhtlingk 4) Dictionary, s.v. suggests ‘axle of a car.’ Geldner 5) Vedische Studien, 1, 136. sees in it a stake or pole used with a fishermen's net (Jāla), 6) Av. viii. 8, 18. the pole of a wagon, 7) Av. i. 180, 5. and the pole of a house, whether vertical or horizontal, he leaves uncertain (see Vaṃśa). 8) ix. 3, 18. Bloomfield 9) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 598. takes it as a covering of wickerwork stretched across a beam and sloping down to both sides--like a thatched roof, and this best explains the epithet ‘thousand-eyed’ (i.e., with countless holes) ascribed to it. In the other Atharvaveda passage 10) Av. viii. 8, 18. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 153, 265; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 506, 526; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 179. he accepts the sense ‘net,’ and doubts if the word in the Rigveda is not an adjective (a-kṣu) as it is taken by Sāyaṇa. See also Gṛha.

agasti|अगस्ति
अगस्ति<BR> --This form of Agastya's name occurs once in the Atharvaveda, 1) iv. 9, 3. Cf. Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 127, n. 5. where he appears as a favourite of Mitra and Varuṇa.

agastya|अगस्त्य
अगस्त्य<BR> --This is the name of a sage, of mythical character, who plays a great part in the later literature. He was a Māna, 1) Rv. vii. 33, 10 (Agastya), 13 (Māna). and therefore is called Mānya 2) Rv. i. 165, 15 = 166, 15 = 167, 11 = 168, 10; 165, 14; 177, 5; 184, 4 (Mānya); i. 189, 8; 117, 11 (Mānasya sūnu). and son of Māna, and only once is there a reference 3) Rv. vii. 33, 13. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 138 et seq. to the legend prevalent in latter times that he was a son of Mitra and Varuṇa. His greatest feat was the reconciliation of Indra and the Maruts after Indra had been annoyed at his proposing to give the Maruts an offering to the exclusion of Indra. This feat is the subject of three hymns of the Rigveda, 4) Rv. i. 165; 170; 171. and is often referred to in the Brāhmaṇas, 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 5, 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 11, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 8; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 11; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxi. 14, 5; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 16; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxvi. 9. though the exact details and significance of the legend are variously treated by Oldenberg, 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 39, 60 et seq. Sieg, 7) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 108-119. Hertel, 8) Vienna Oriental Journal, 18, 152-154. and von Schroeder. 9) Mysterium und Mimus im Rigveda, 91 et seq. He also appears in a strange dialogue with Lopāmudrā in the Rigveda, 10) i. 179. Cf. Sieg, op. cit., 120-126; Oldenberg, op. cit., 66-68. which appears to show him as an ascetic who finally yields to temptation. Von Schroeder 11) Op. cit., 156-172. regards it as a ritual drama of vegetation magic. In another passage of the Rigveda 12) i. 117, 11; cf. i. 116, 15. he appears as helping in the Aśvins’ gift of a leg to Viśpalā. Sāyaṇa holds that be was the Purohita of Khela, and Sieg 13) Op. cit., 128. accepts this view, while Pischel 14) Vedische Studien, 1, 171-173. thinks that Khela is a deity, Vivasvant. Geldner 15) Vedische Studien, 2, 138, 143. shows from the Rigveda 16) Rv. vii. 33, 10. 13. that Agastya, as brother of Vasiṣṭha--both being miraculous sons of Mitra and Varuṇa -introduces Vasiṣṭha to the Tṛtsus. There are two other references to Agastya in the Rigveda, the one 17) vii. 5, 26. Sieg, 129, suggests that this refers to the Khela legend. including him in a long list of persons, the other alluding to his sister's sons (nadbhyaḥ), 18) x. 60, 6. apparently Bandhu, etc. In the Atharvaveda 19) ii. 32, 3; iv. 37, 1. Perhaps for this reason the Rigveda Anukramaṇī ascribes to him (Rv. i. 191) a magic hymn. he appears as connected with witchcraft, and in a long list of sages. 20) xviii. 3, 15. In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 21) iv. 2, 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 117; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 106-129; Macdonell, Bṛhaddevatā, 2, 136 et seq.; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 221; Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 110. cows, with a peculiar mark on their ears (viṣṭya-karṇyaḥ), are associated with him.

agara|अगर
अगर<BR> --This rare word is found as ‘house’ in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad. 1) ii. 15. Cf. āgara, ‘chamber’ (?), n Av. iv. 36, 3; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 407. Agāra occurs also in Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 7, 21. 

agnidagdha|अग्निदग्ध
अग्नि-दग्ध<BR> --This epithet (‘burnt with fire’) 1) Rv. x. 15, 14; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 1, 7; dagdhāḥ, Av. xviii. 2, 34. applies to the dead who were burned on the funeral pyre. This is one of the two normal methods of disposing of the dead, the other being burial (an-agnidagdhāḥ, ‘not burnt with fire’). 2) Rv., loc. cit.; = nikhātāḥ, Av. xviii. 2, 34. The Atharvaveda 3) Loc. cit. adds two further modes of disposal to those-viz., casting out (paroptāḥ), and the exposure of the dead (uddhitāḥ). The exact sense of these expressions is doubtful. Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 402. considers that the former is a parallel to the Iranian practice of casting out the dead to be devoured by beasts, and that the latter refers to the old who are exposed when helpless. 5) Rv. viii. 51, 2. Whitney 6) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 841. refers the latter expression to the exposure of the dead body on a raised platform of some sort. Burial was clearly not rare in the Rigvedic period: a whole hymn 7) x. 18. The interpretation of v. 8 is a famous crux, see Patnī. describes the ritual attending it. The dead man was buried apparently in full attire, with his bow in his hand, and probably at one time his wife was immolated to accompany him, in accordance with a practice common among savage tribes. But in the Vedic period both customs appear in a modified form: the son takes the bow from the hand of the dead man, and the widow is led away from her dead husband by his brother or other nearest kinsman. A stone is set between the dead and the living to separate them. In the Atharvaveda, 8) xviii. 2, 25; 3, 70. but not in the Rigveda, a coffin (vṛkṣa) is alluded to. In both Saṃhitās 9) Rv. vii. 89, 1; Av. v. 30, 14; xviii. 2, 52. occur other allusions to the ‘house of earth’ (bhūmi-gṛha). To remove the apparent discrepancy between burning and burial, by assuming that the references to burial are to the burial of the burned bones, as does Oldenberg, 10) Religion des Veda, 571. is unnecessary and improbable, as burning and burial subsisted side by side in Greece for many years. Burning was, however, equally usual, and it grew steadily in frequency, for in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 11) viii. 8. 5. the adornment of the body of the dead with curd (Āmikṣā), clothes, and ornaments, in order to win the next world, is referred to as something erroneous and wrong, and in the funeral Mantras of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 12) xxxv. Cf. also Kauśika Sūtra, 80 et seq., which treats the Atharvaveda hymns, xviii. 1-3, as intended for burning only. only burning seems to be contemplated; the verses which refer to burial here really alluding to the burial of the ashes in the burying-ground (śmaśāna). 13) Av. v. 31, 8; x. 1, 18; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 8, 5; 4, 11, 3. The body was wrapped in fat, 14) Rv. x. 16, 7. as we learn from the funeral hymn in the Rigveda, a goat being apparently burned with it, 15) Rv. x. 16, 4. But aja may mean ‘the unborn part,’ as Weber prefers to take it, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1895, 847. to act as a guide on the way to the next world. According to the Atharvaveda 16) xii. 2, 48. a draft-ox was burned presumably for the dead to ride with in the next world. It was expected that the dead would revive with his whole body and all his limbs (sarva-tanūḥ sāṅgaḥ), 17) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 6, 1, 1; xi. 1, 8, 6; xii. 8, 3, 31. Cf. Av. xi. 3, 32. This fact probably explains the use of śeṣaḥ in Rv. x. 16, 5. The dead enjoy sexual pleasures in the next world; see Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 307, n. 462. although it is also said 18) Rv. x. 16, 3. that the eye goes to the sun, the breath to the wind, and so forth. Before burial or burning, the corpse was washed, 19) Av. v. 19, 14. a clog (kūdī) being tied to the foot to prevent the deceased returning to earth. 20) Av. v. 19, 12; see Roth, Festgruss an Böhtlingk, 98; Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 12, 416.

agnibhuukaashyapa|अग्निभूकाश्यप
अग्नि-भू काश्यप<BR> is mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) Indische Studien, 4, 374.

agnishaala|अग्निशाल
अग्नि-शाल<BR> --This term, which designates part of the sacrificial apparatus, 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 18. is applied in the Atharvaveda 2) ix. 3, 7. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns. of the Atharvaveda, 598; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 154. to a part of an ordinary house, presumably the central hall where the fireplace was.

aghaa|अघा
अघा<BR> --In the wedding hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 85, 13. it is said that cows are slain in the Aghās, and the wedding takes place at the Arjunīs (dual). The Atharvaveda 2) xiv. 1, 13. has the ordinary Maghās instead. It is impossible to resist the conclusion that the reading of the Rigveda was deliberately altered because of the connection of the slaughter of kine with sin (agha)--possibly, too, with a further desire to emphasize the contrast with aghnyā, a name for ‘cow.’ Moreover, in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 3) iii. 1, 4, 8. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 364; Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1894, 804; Jacobi, Festgruss an Roth, 69; Winternitz, Das altindische Hochzeitsrituell, 32; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 742; Thibaut, Indian Antiquary, 24, 95. occurs the formula ‘Svāhā to the Maghās, Svāhā to the Anaghās.’ See also Nakṣatra.

aghaashva|अघाश्व
अघाश्व<BR> --The name of a serpent in the Atharvaveda. 1) x. 4, 10. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95.

aghnyaa|अघ्न्या
अ-घ्न्या<BR> --See Māṃsa.

anka|अङ्क
अङ्क<BR> --The Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) i. 7, 7, 2. and Brāhmaṇa 2) ii. 7, 8, 1. Cf. Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 5. refer to two Aṅkas and two Nyaṅkas as parts of a chariot. The meaning of these terms is quite obscure. The commentators refer them to the sides or wheels. Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 251, 252. compares the Greek  4) Iliad, v. 728. Cf. Smith's Dictionary of Antiquities, 1, 578. and thinks that the Aṅkau were the upper border of the body of the chariot (kośa, vandhura), and the Nyaṅkau the lower rims for greater security. Oldenberg 5) Sacred Books of the East, 29, 364, on Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 14, 6. confesses that the exact sense is impossible to make out, but considers that the terms at once refer to parts of the chariot and to divinities, while Böhtlingk 6) Dictionary, s.v. takes the term as referring to divinities alone. 

anga|अङ्ग
अङ्ग<BR> --The name occurs only once in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 22, 14. in connection with the Gandhāris, Mūjavants, and Magadhas, as distinct peoples. They appear also in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa 2) ii. 9. in the compound name Aṅga-magadhāḥ. As in later times they were settled on the Sone and Ganges, 3) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 35; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 446, 449; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 852, inclines to regard them as a non-Aryan people that came over-sea to Eastern India. There is nothing in the Vedic literature to throw light on this hypothesis. their earlier seat was presumably there also. See also Vaṅga.

angavairochana|अङ्गवैरोचन
अङ्ग वैरोचन<BR> --He is included in the list of anointed kings in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 1) viii. 22. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 214. His Purohita was Udamaya, an Ātreya.

angaaraavaxayaNa|अङ्गारावक्षयण
अङ्गारावक्षयण<BR> --A word of doubtful meaning found in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) iii. 9, 18. It is rendered ‘tongs’ by Max Müller and Böhtlingk in their translations. The St. Petersburg Dictionary explains it as ‘a vessel in which coals are extinguished,’ and Monier-Williams as ‘an instrument for extinguishing coals.’ The smaller St. Petersburg Dictionary renders the word ‘coal-shovel or tongs.’ Cf. Ulmukāvakṣayaṇa.

angiras|अङ्गिरस्
अङ्गिरस्<BR> --The Aṅgirases appear in the Rigveda 1) Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, ii. 156-169. as semimythical beings, and no really historical character can be assigned even to those passages 2) Rv. i. 45, 3; 139, 9; iii. 31, 7, etc.; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 2, 10. which recognize a father of the race, Aṅgiras. Later, however, there were definite families of Aṅgirases, to whose ritual practices (ayana, dvirātra) references are made. 3) Av. xviii. 4, 8, but this may be mythical; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xx. 11, 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 4, 1. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 142, 143.

anguShTha|अङ्गुष्ठ
अङ्गुष्ठ<BR> --As a measure of size this word appears in the Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad (iv. 12; vi. 17). 

achyut|अच्युत्
अ-च्युत्<BR> --He acted as Pratihartṛ at the Sattra celebrated by the Vibhindukīyas and described in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa. 1) iii. 233. See Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 38.

aja|अज
अज, अजा<BR> --This is the ordinary name for goat in the Rigveda 1) Aja in Rv. x. 16, 4; i. 162, 2. 4; Av. ix. 5, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 9, etc.; ajā in Rv. viii. 70, 15; Av. vi. 71, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii., 56, etc. and the later literature. The goat is also called Basta, Chāga, Chagala. Goats and sheep (ajāvayaḥ) are very frequently mentioned together. 2) Rv. x. 90, 10; Av. viii. 7, 25; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 43, etc. The female goat is spoken of as producing two or three kids, 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 10, 1. and goat's milk is well known. 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 6, 1; v. 1, 7, 4. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 364, n. 4. The goat as representative of Pūṣan plays an important part in the ritual of burial. 5) Rv. x. 16, 4, etc. Cf. p. 9. The occupation of a goatherd (ajapāla) was a recognized one, being distinguished from that of a cowherd and of a shepherd. 6) Vājasaneyī Saṃhitā, xxx. 11; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 9, 1.

aja|अज
अज<BR> --The Ajas are named in one verse of the Rigveda 1) vii. 18. 19. as having been defeated by the Tṛtsus under Sudās. They are there mentioned with the Yakṣus and Śigrus, and Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 127, Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173. conjectures that they formed part of a confederacy under Bheda against Sudās. The name has been regarded as a sign of totemism, 3) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 153; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 929; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 200, 21; Risley, Peoples of India, 83 et seq. but this is very uncertain, and it is impossible to say if they were or were not Āryans.

ajakava|अजकव
अजकव<BR> --This name of a poisonous scorpion occurs once in the Rigveda. 1) vii. 50, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99.

ajagara|अजगर
अज-गर<BR> (‘goat-swallower’) occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) xi. 2, 25; xx. 129, 17. and in the list of animals at the Aśvamedha, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā 5, 14, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii, 14, 19; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 38. or horse sacrifice, as the name of the boa-constrictor. Elsewhere 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 13, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 34. it is called Vāhasa. It denotes a person at the snake feast in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 4) xxv. 15, in the form of Ajagāva, with which cf. Ajakāva.

ajamiiDha|अजमीढ
अज-मीढ<BR> --The Ājamīḍhas, or descendants of Ajamīḍha, are referred to in a hymn of the Rigveda. 1) iv. 44, 6. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 123, 135. and Oldenberg 3) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 215. deduce from the use of this patronymic that Ajamīḍha was the seer of that hymn.

ajashRngii|अजशृङ्गी
अज-शृङ्गी<BR> --This plant (‘goat's horn’), equated by the commentator with Viṣāṇin (the Odina pinnata), is celebrated as a demon-destroyer in the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 37. Its other name is Arāṭakī. 2) iv. 37, 6. Weber 3) Indische Studien, 18, 144. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 408, 409; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 68; Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, 89. suggests that it is the Prosopis spicigera or Mimosa suma.

ajaatashatru|अजातशत्रु
अजात-शत्रु<BR> --He is mentioned as a King of Kāśī (Kāśya) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 1) ii. 1, 1. and Kauṣītaki 2) iv. 1. Upaniṣads, where he instructs the proud Brāhmaṇa Bālāki as to the real nature of the self. He is not to be identified with the Ajātasattu of the Buddhist texts. 3) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 213; Hoernle, Osteology, 106; Keith, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 62, 138.

aJNaatayaxma|अज्ञातयक्ष्म
अज्ञात-यक्ष्म,<BR> the ‘unknown sickness,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) x. 161, 1 = Av. iii. 11, 1. Atharvaveda, 2) vi. 127, 3. and Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 3) xiii. 16. It is referred to in connection with Rājayakṣma. Grohmann 4) Indische Studien, 9, 400. thinks that the two are different forms of disease, hypertrophy and atrophy, the purpose of the spell in the Rigveda being thus the removal of all disease. From the Atharvaveda 5) vi. 127. 3. he deduces its identity with Balāsa. Zimmer, 6) Altindisches Leben, 377, 378. Cf. Bloomfield. Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 342; Atharvaveda, 60; Jolly, Medicin (in Bühler's Encyclopædia), 89. however, points out that this conclusion is unjustified, leaving the disease unidentified, which seems to accord with its name.

ajina|अजिन
अजिन<BR> --This word denotes generally the skin of an animal -e.g., a gazelle, 1) Av. v. 21, 7. as well as that of a goat (Aja). 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 1, 21. 24. The use of skins as clothing is shown by the adjective ‘clothed in skins’ (ajina-vāsin) in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 3) iii. 9, 1, 12. and the furrier's trade is mentioned in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 4) xxx. 15 (ajina-saṃdha); Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 13, 1 (ajinasaṃdhāya). The Maruts also wear deer-skins, 5) Rv. i. 166, 10. and the wild ascetics (muni) of a late Rigveda hymn 6) x. 136, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 262. seem to be clad in skins (Mala).

ajira|अजिर
अजिर<BR> --He was Subrahmaṇya priest at the snake festival of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 15. See Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

ajiigartasauyavasa|अजीगर्तसौयवस
अजीगर्त सौयवस<BR> --This is the name given to the father of Śunaḥśepa in the famous legend of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 1) vii. 15; 17. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xv. 19. perhaps invented for the occasion, as Weber 2) Indische Studien, 1, 460; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. suggests.

ajyeyataa|अज्येयता
अ-ज्येयता<BR> See Brāhmaṇa.

aNiichinmauna|अणीचिन्मौन
अणीचिन् मौन<BR> --He is mentioned as an authority on ritual, and contemporary with Jābāla and Citra Gauśrāyaṇi or Gauśra, in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxiii. 5.

aNu|अणु
अणु<BR> --This is the designation in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 1) xviii. 12. and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2) vi. 3, 15 (Kāṇva), where see Dviveda's note. of a cultivated grain, apparently the Panicum miliaceum.

atithi|अतिथि
अतिथि<BR> (‘guest’).--A hymn of the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 6. celebrates in detail the merits of hospitality. The guest should be fed before the host eats, water should be offered to him, and so forth. The Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2) i. 11, 2. also lays stress on hospitality, using the expression ‘one whose deity is his guest’ (atithi-deva). In the Aitareya Āraṇyaka 3) i. 1, 1. it is said that only the good are deemed worthy of receiving hospitality. The guest-offering forms a regular part of the ritual, 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 3, 2, 1. and cows were regularly slain in honour of guests. 5) Cf. Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 17, 426; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 79.

atithigva|अतिथिग्व
अतिथि-ग्व<BR> --This name occurs frequently in the Rigveda, apparently applying, in nearly all cases, to the same king, otherwise called Divodāsa. The identity of the two persons has been denied by Bergaigne, 1) Religion Védique, 2, 342 et seq. but is certainly proved by a number of passages, when the two names occur together, 2) Rv. i. 51, 6; 112, 14; 130, 7; iv. 26, 3; vi. 47, 22. in connection with the defeat of Śambara. In other passages 3) Rv. i. 53, 8; x. 48, 8. Atithigva is said to have assisted Indra in slaying Parṇaya and Karañja. Sometimes he is only vaguely referred to, while once 5) Rv. vii. 19, 8. There is no ground for assuming the reference here to be to a later Atithigva. he is mentioned as an enemy of Turvaśa and Yadu. Again 6) Rv. i. 53, 10; ii. 14, 7; vi. 18, 13; viii. 53, 2. Atithigva is coupled with Āyu and Kutsa as defeated by Tūrvayāṇa. A different Atithigva appears to be referred to in a Dānastuti 7) Rv. viii. 68, 16. 17. (‘Praise of Gifts’), where his son, Indrota, is mentioned. Roth 8) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 123; Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 17, 426, who renders the name ‘presenting cows to guests.’ distinguishes three Atithigvas--the Atithigva Divodāsa, the enemy of Parṇaya and Karañja, and the enemy of Tūrvayāṇa. But the various passages can be reconciled, especially if it is admitted that Atithigva Divodāsa was already an ancient hero in the earliest hymns, and was becoming almost mythical. 4) Rv. vi. 26, 3.

atidhanvanshaunaka|अतिधन्वन्शौनक
अति-धन्वन् शौनक<BR> --He is mentioned as a teacher in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1) i. 9, 3. and the Vaṃsa Brāhmaṇa. 2) Indische Studien, 4, 384. 

atRNaada|अतृणाद
अ-तृणाद<BR> --This term (‘not eating grass’) was applied, according to the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, to a newborn calf. 1) i. 5, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 268.

atka|अत्क
1. Atka.<BR> --This word occurs frequently in the Rigveda, but its sense is doubtful. Roth, Grassmann, Ludwig, Zimmer, 1) Altindisches Leben, 262. and others render it as ‘garment’ in several passages, 2) i. 95, 7; ii. 35, 14; iv. 18, 5; v. 55, 6; 74, 5; vi. 29, 3; viii. 41, 7; ix. 101, 14; 107, 13; Sāmaveda, ii. 1193. when the expressions ‘put on’ (vyā or prati muñc) or ‘put off’ (muñc) are used of it, and when it is said to be ‘woven’ (vyuta) 3) Rv. i. 122, 2. or ‘wellfitting’ (surabhi). 4) Rv. vi. 29, 3; x. 123, 7. On the other hand, Pischel 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 193-204. denies that this sense occurs, and otherwise explains the passages. He takes the term to mean ‘axe’ in four places. 6) Rv. v. 55, 6; vi. 33, 3; x. 49, 3; 99, 9. Cf. Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 94, n. 1.

atka|अत्क
2. Atka.<BR> --In two passages of the Rigveda 1) x. 49, 3; 99, 9. this word is regarded as a proper name by Roth, Grassmann, and Ludwig. But Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 262, 297. explains it in these passages as the ‘armour of a warrior as a whole,’ and Pischel 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 195. thinks that in both cases an ‘axe’ is meant.

atyaMhasaaruNi|अत्यंहसारुणि
अत्य्-अंहस् आरुणि<BR> --According to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 10, 9, 3-5), this teacher sent a pupil to question Plakṣa Dayyāṃpati as to the Sāvitra (a form of Agni). For this impertinence his pupil was severely rebuked.

atyaraatijaanaMtapi|अत्यरातिजानंतपि
अत्य्-अराति जानं-तपि,<BR> though not a prince, was taught the Rājasūya by Vāsiṣṭha Satyahavya, and thereupon conquered the earth. When Vāsiṣṭha reminded him of his indebtedness, and claimed a great reward, the warrior replied irascibly that he intended to conquer the Uttara Kurus, and that Vāsiṣṭha would then become King of the Earth, Atyarāti himself being his general (senā-pati). Vāsiṣṭha replied that as no mortal man could conquer the Uttara Kurus he was cheated of his reward. He consequently procured Atyarāti's defeat and death at the hands of Amitratapana Śuṣmiṇa Śaibya. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 23. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 214.

atri|अत्रि
अत्रि<BR> --Neither Atri himself nor the Atris can claim any historical reality, 1) For Atri in the Rigveda, see Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 145. Cf. also Av. ii. 32, 3; iv. 29, 3; Mantra Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 1; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iv. 36, etc.; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 2, 4. beyond the fact that Maṇḍala V. of the Rigveda is attributed, no doubt correctly, to the family of the Atris. 2) Cf. Rv. v. 39, 5; 67, 5; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxiv. 3; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii, 2, 1. The Atris as a family probably stood in close relations with the Priyamedhas 3) Cf. Rv. i. 45, 3; 139, 9; viii. 5, 25; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 22. and Kaṇvas, 4) Cf. Rv. i. 118, 7; v. 41, 4; x. 150, 5. perhaps also with the Gotamas 5) Cf. Rv. i. 183, 5. and Kākṣīvatas. 6) Cf. Rv. x. 143, 1. The mention of both the Paruṣṇī and the Yamunā in one hymn 7) Rv. v. 52, 9, 17. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 128, 142; Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 2, 469; Oldenber, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 212215; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 310. of the fifth Maṇḍala seems to justify the presumption that the family was spread over a wide extent of territory.

atharii|अथरी
अथरी<BR> --This word occurs only in the Rigveda, 1) iv. 6, 8. and the sense is doubtful. Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. followed by most interpreters, renders it ‘point of a lance,’ but Pischel 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 99. thinks that it means ‘an elephant.’

atharvan|अथर्वन्
अथर्वन्<BR> --The name in the singular denotes the head of a semi-divine family of mythical priests, 1) See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 141. In the Vaṃśa of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 6, 3, Atharvan Daiva is characteristically the pupil of Mṛtyu. of whom nothing historical can be said. In the plural the family as a whole is meant. In a few places an actual family seems to be referred to. Thus, for instance, they are mentioned as recipients of gifts in the Dānastuti 2) Rv. vi. 47, 24. (‘Praise of Gifts’), of Aśvattha's generosity; their use of milk mingled with honey in the ritual is referred to; 3) Rv. ix. 11, 2. and a cow that miscarries (ava-tokā) from accident is dedicated to the Atharvans, according to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 4) iii. 4, 11, 1. Cf. Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 15. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xxxv. et seq., who (p. xxxviii) takes avatokā as a woman, and the Atharvans as the hymns; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 174 et seq.

atharvaaNa|atharvaaNaH|अथर्वाण|अथर्वाणः
अथर्वाणः<BR> --This expression 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 12, 9, 1; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 10, 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 3, 5 et seq. is used with Aṅgirasaḥ, to denote the Atharvaveda. The compound Atharvāṅgirasaḥ is employed in the same sense.

atharvaangirasa|atharvaangirasaH|अथर्वाङ्गिरस|अथर्वाङ्गिरसः
अथर्वाङ्गिरसः<BR> --This is the collective name of the Atharvaveda in several passages 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 12, 8, 2; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 9; 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 6, 7; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 2; 5, 11; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iii. 4, 1. 2; Taittirīya Upaniṣad, ii. 3, 1. of the later Brāhmaṇas. It occurs once in the Atharvaveda itself, 2) x. 7, 20. while the term Atharvaveda is not found before the Sūtra period. 3) Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xvi. 2, 9, etc. The compound seems, according to Bloomfield, 4) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, 387 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xviii. et seq. to denote the two elements which make up the Atharvaveda. The former part refers to the auspicious practices of the Veda (bheṣajāni); 5) Av. xi. 6, 14. the latter to its hostile witchcraft, the yātu 6) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 5, 2, 20. or abhi-cāra. 7) Kauśika Sūtra, 3, 19. This theory is supported by the names of the two mythic personages Ghora Āṅgirasa and Bhiṣaj Ātharvaṇa, as well as by the connection of Atharvāṇaḥ and Ātharvaṇāni with healing (bheṣaja) in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 8) xii. 9, 10; xvi. 10, 10. Moreover, the term bhesajā (‘remedies’) designates in the Atharvaveda 9) x. 6, 14. that Veda itself, while in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10) x. 5, 2, 20. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 177. yātu (‘sorcery’) conveys the same meaning. The evidence, however, being by no means convincing, it remains probable that there existed no clear differentiation between the two sages as responsible for the Atharvaveda as a whole. 

adRShTa|अदृष्ट
अ-दृष्ट<BR> --‘The unseen’ is a term used in the Rigveda 1) Rv. i. 191, 4 = Av. vi. 52, 2. and the Atharvaveda 2) vi. 52, 3. to designate a species of vermin. The sun is also described as ‘the slayer of the unseen’ (adṛṣṭa-han), 3) Rv. i. 191, 9 = Av. vi. 52, 1; Av. v. 23, 6. and as a counterpart a ‘seen’ (dṛṣṭa) is mentioned. 4) Av. ii. 31, 2; viii. 8, 15. In one passage 5) Av. v. 23, 6. 7. the epithets ‘seen’ and ‘unseen’ are applied to the worm (Kṛmi), their use being no doubt due to the widespread theory of diseases being due to worms, whether discernable by examination or not. 6) Kuhn, Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung, 13, 135 et seq.; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 313315; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

admasad|अद्मसद्
अद्म-सद्<BR> --This expression (lit. ‘sitting at the meal’), found several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 124, 4; vi. 30, 3; vii. 83, 7; viii. 44, 29; adma-sadvan, vi. 4, 4. is usually rendered ‘guest at the feast,’ but Geldner 2) Vedische Studien, 2, 179, 180; but of Oldenberg, Vedaforschung, 90. adduces reasons to show that it means ‘a fly,’ so called because of its settling on food.

adri|अद्रि
अद्रि<BR> --Zimmer 1) Altindisches Leben, 301. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. deduces from the use of this word (‘rock,’ ‘stone’) in a passage of the Rigveda, 2) i. 51, 3. that sling-stones were used in Vedic fighting. But the passage is mythical, referring to Indra's aid, and cannot be used with any certainty as evidence for human war. More probably it merely denotes Indra's bolt. See also Aśani.

adhidevana|अधिदेवन
अधि-देवन<BR> --The place where the dice were thrown is thus designated in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 31, 6; vi. 70, 1. and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 2) v. 4, 4, 20. 22, 23. according to Lüders. 3) Das Würfelspiel im alten Indien, 11-13. Roth, 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. followed by Whitney, takes it to mean ‘gambling-board.’ See Akṣa.

adhiraaja|अधिराज
अधि-राज<BR> --The word occurs fairly often throughout the early literature, 1) Rv. x. 128, 9 Av. vi. 98, 1; ix. 10, 24; Taiturīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 14, 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhita, iv. 12, 3; Kāthaka Saṃhitā, viii. 17; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 2, 9 (adhirājan); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 2, 2; Nirukta, viii. 2. denoting ‘overlord’ among kings or princes. In no passage is it clear that a real over-king is meant, as the word rājan may mean king or merely prince, a person of royal blood. On the whole it seems most probable that the word connotes no more than ‘king’ as opposed to ‘prince.’

adhiShavaNa|अधिषवण
अधि-षवण<BR> --The two Adhiṣavaṇas 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 21; Av. v. 20, 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 9, 4, 1; 5, 3, 22 (adhiṣavaṇe phalake); Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 32 (adhiṣavaṇaṃ carma, ‘the skin upon which the pressing takes place’; adhiṣavaṇe phalake, ‘the boards on which the pressing takes place,’ etc.). are usually understood, as by Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 277. to designate the two boards between which the Soma was pressed. Hillebrandt, 4) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 148 et seq. however, shows from the ritual that the boards were not placed one over the other, but were placed one behind the other, the two serving as a foundation upon which the Soma was pressed by a stone. This theory seems to account best for the etymological sense of the name ‘over-press,’ as well as for the use of the word as an adjective (‘used for pressing upon’). But according to the procedure as witnessed by Haug 5) See Haug, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 2, p. 488, n. 10. in the Deccan, the shoots of the plant are first placed on the skin, one of the boards being then laid over them and pounded with a stone. The shoots are then taken out and placed upon the board, the second board being then laid over them.

adhiivaasa|अधीवास
अधी¤-वास<BR> --This word 1) Rv. i. 140, 9; 162, 16; x. 5, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 5, 22 (pratimuñc, ‘put on’); 4, 4, 3 (ā-stṛ, ‘spread out’), etc. denotes the ‘upper garment’ of the Vedic Indian. Its exact nature is not described, but as the king in the ritual set forth in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) v. 3, 5, 19 et seq. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 268. puts on first an undergarment, then a garment, and finally an upper garment, it presumably denotes some sort of cloak or mantle.

adhyaaNDaa|अध्याण्डा
अध्याण्डा<BR> --This is a plant mentioned with many others in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 8, 1, 16). 

adhrigu|अध्रिगु
अध्रि-गु<BR> --This is the name of a man twice referred to in the Rigveda 1) i. 112, 20; viii. 12, 2. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 90. as a protégé of the Aśvins and of Indra respectively.

adhvaryu|अध्वर्यु
अध्वर्यु<BR> --In one passage of the Rigveda 1) iii. 7, 7. Hillebrandt 2) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 423. thinks that the five Adhvaryus who are mentioned do not designate actual priests, but refer to the five planets which move about in the heavens like the Adhvaryu priests on the sacrificial ground. See also Graha.

anagnidagdha|अनग्निदग्ध
अन्-अग्नि-दग्ध,<BR> ‘not burnt with fire.’ See Agni-dagdha, ‘burnt with fire.’

anaDvaah|अनड्वाह्
अनड्-वाह्<BR> (lit. ‘cart-drawer’).--This is the common 1) Rv. x. 59, 10; 85, 10; iii. 53, 18; Av. iii. 11, 5; iv. 11, 1, etc.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 14; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 4, 17, etc. name of oxen as employed for drawing carts (Anas). Such oxen were normally castrated, 2) Cf. Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 1, 5 (anaḍvān sāṇḍaḥ). though not always. Female draft cattle were also used (anaḍuhī), but rarely. 3) Av. iv. 11; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v, 3, 4, 11. 13. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 151, n.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 226. See also Gō.

anas|अनस्
अनस्<BR> --This is the term 1) Rv. iv. 30, 10; x. 85, 10; 86, 18, etc.; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 5, etc.; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vii. 15, 1; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iii. 8, etc. used to designate the draft wagon, as opposed to the chariot (ratha) for war or sport, with which it is sometimes expressly contrasted, 2) Rv. iii. 33, 9. though Indra is once said to be ‘seated in a wagon’ (anar-viś) 3) Rv. i. 121, 7. instead of on a chariot. Though Uṣas, Goddess of Dawn, sometimes rides on a chariot (ratha), the wagon is her characteristic vehicle. 4) Rv. ii. 15, 6; iv. 30, 11; viii. 91, 7; x. 73, 6; 138, 5. Of its construction we know little. The bridal wagon on which Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun, was borne in the marriage hymn in the Rigveda had a covering (Chadis). 5) Rv. x. 85, 10. The axle-box (Kha) is also mentioned. 6) Rv. viii. 91, 7; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 3. In the Atharvaveda 7) xv. 2, 1. Vipatha appears to denote a rough vehicle used for bad tracks. The wagon was usually drawn by oxen (Anaḍvāh), as in wedding processions. 8) Rv. x. 85, 11 The wagon of Dawn is described as drawn by ruddy cows or bulls. 9) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 47. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 246; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 4.

anaas|अनास्
अनास्<BR> See Dasyu.

anitabhaa|अनितभा
अनितभा<BR> in the Rigveda 1) v. 53. 9. is taken by Max Müller 2) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 323; but of. Rasā. to denote some river.

anu|अनु
अनु, आनव<BR> --Grassmann and Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary. see in these words designations of people foreign to the Aryans. But it is clear 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 125. that they denote a special people, the Anus, who are mentioned with the Yadus, Turvaśas, Druhyus, and Pūrus, 3) Rv. i. 108, 8. with the Druhyus, 4) Rv. vii. 18, 14. and with the Turvaśas, Yadus, and Druhyus. 5) viii. 10, 5. It is also a fair conclusion from their mention in a passage of the Rigveda 6) Rv. viii. 74. 15, compared with vii. 18, 14. that they dwelt on the Paruṣṇī. The inference that the Bhṛgus were connected with this tribe is much more doubtful, 7) Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 221, n. 1. for it rests solely on the fact that in one place 8) Rv. vii. 18, 4. the Bhṛgus and Druhyus are mentioned together, and not Anus and Druhyus. Ānava is used as an epithet of Agni, 9) Rv. viii. 74, 4. Cf. Rv. v. 31, 4, where the Anus prepare the chariot of the Aśvins. but also in the sense of ‘Anu prince,’ 10) Rv. vii. 18, 13. in one case in conjunction with Turvaśa. 11) viii. 4, 1. Apparently as prince also in vi. 62, 9. Cf. Kuruṅga. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 205; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 153; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 154.

anuxattR|अनुक्षत्तृ
अनु-क्षत्तृ<BR> --This word occurs in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha, 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 11; 73; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 9, 1. and means, according to Mahīdhara, 2) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit. ‘an attendant on the door-keeper,’ and, according to Sāyaṇa, ‘an attendant on the charioteer’ (sārathi). See also Kṣattṛ. 3) On Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. 

anuchara|अनुचर
अनु-चर<BR> --This is a general expression 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 13; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 7, 1. for an ‘attendant’ (the feminine being Anucarī), 2) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 27 (apparently slave girls are meant, 400 being enumerated). but it is not often used.

anumati|अनुमति
अनु-मति<BR> See Māsa.

anuraadhaa|अनुराधा
अनु-राधा<BR> See Nakṣatra.

anuvaktRsatyasaatyakiirta|अनुवक्तृसत्यसात्यकीर्त
अनु-वक्तृ सत्य सात्य-कीर्त<BR> is mentioned as a teacher in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa Upaniṣad (i. 5, 4).

anuvyaakhyaana|अनुव्याख्यान
अनुव्या-ख्यान<BR> is a species of writing referred to in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 2; 5, 11. Śaṅkara interprets it as ‘explanation of the Mantras.’ As the term, in the plural, follows Sūtras, this interpretation is reasonable. Sieg, 2) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 34. however, equates the word with Anvākhyāna, ‘supplementary narrative.’

anushaasana|अनुशासन
अनु-शासन<BR> in the plural denotes in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xi. 5, 6, 8) some form of literature; according to Sāyaṇa, the Vedāṅgas.

anushikha|अनुशिख
अनु-शिख<BR> is the name of the Potṛ at the snake festival in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 15. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

antevaasin|अन्तेवासिन्
अन्ते-वासिन्,<BR> ‘dwelling near,’ is the epithet of the Brahmacārin who lives in the house of his teacher. The expression does not occur before the late Brāhmaṇa period. 1) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 5, 17; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 3, 7; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iii. 11, 5; iv. 10, 1; Taittirīya Upaniṣad, i. 3, 3; 11, 1. Secrecy is often enjoined on others than Antevāsins. 2) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 2, 6; Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, viii, 11.

andhra|अन्ध्र
अन्ध्र<BR> is the name of a people, and is mentioned with the Puṇḍras, Śabaras, Pulindas, and Mūtibas, as being the outcasts resulting from the refusal of the fifty eldest sons of Viśvāmitra to accept his adoption of Śunaḥśepa. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 18; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 26, where instead of udāntyaḥ (‘beyond the borders’) the reading is udañcaḥ (‘northern’), but the former is obviously correct. The Sāṅkhāyana omits the Pulindas, and has Mūcīpas. It may fairly be deduced from this statement that these people were recognized as nonAryan, as the Andhras certainly seem to have been. 2) Vincent Smith, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 56, 657 et seq., who places them originally in Eastern India between the Kṛṣṇā and Godāvarī rivers; cf. Rapson, Catalogue of Indian Coins, xv., xvi.; Bhandarkar, Bombay Gazetteer, 1. ii. 138.

anyataHplaxaa|अन्यतःप्लक्षा
अन्यतः-प्लक्षा<BR> (‘with wave-leafed fig-trees on one side only’) is the name of a lake in Kurukṣetra according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) xi. 5, 1, 4. where it occurs in the story of Purūravas and Urvaśī. Pischel 2) Vedische Studien, 2, 217. places it somewhere in Sirmor.

anyavaapa|अन्यवाप
अन्य-वाप<BR> (‘sowing for others’).--The cuckoo is so called 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 37; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 18. from its habit of depositing its eggs in the nests of other birds

anvaakhyaana|अन्वाख्यान
अन्वा-ख्यान<BR> --From the literal translation (‘after-story’) the meaning of ‘supplementary narrative’ seems to follow. In two 1) vi. 5, 2, 22; 6, 4, 7 (the reference is to vi. 6, 4, 8). of its three occurrences in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa this sense is hardly felt, the expression being used to indicate a subsequent portion of the book itself. But in the third 2) xi. 1, 6, 9. Cf. Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 34. passage it is distinguished from the Itihāsa (‘story’) proper, and there must mean ‘supplementary narrative.’ Cf. Anuvyākhyāna.

apachit|अपचित्
अप-चित्<BR> --This word occurs several times in the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 25, 1; 83, 1; vii. 75, 1; 77, 1. It is held by Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 97. So also Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, {??} 342, 500. and others to denote an insect whose sting produced swellings, etc. (glau). But Bloomfield 4) American Journal of Philology, 11, 320 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 503, 504. Cf. Jolly, Medicin, 89; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 343. shows that the disease, scrofulous swellings, is what is really meant, as is shown by the rendering (gaṇḍa-mālā, ‘inflammation of the glands of the neck’) of Keśava and Sāyaṇa, and by the parallelism of the later disease, apacī, the derivation being from apa and ci, ‘to pick off.’ 

apashraya|अपश्रय
अप-श्रय<BR> See Upaśraya.

apaskambha|अपस्कम्भ
अप-स्कम्भ<BR> --The word occurs only in one passage of the Atharvaveda, where the tip of it is mentioned as poisoned. Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. The passage is Av. iv. 6, 4. suggests that the fastening of the arrow-point to the shaft is meant. Whitney 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 153. inclines to this version, but suggests corruption of text. Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 300. follows Roth. Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 512. renders the word by ‘barb.’ Bloomfield 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 375. thinks it means ‘tearing (arrow),’ a sense deduced from the etymology.

apaachyas|अपाच्यस्
अपाच्यस्<BR> --The kings of the ‘Westerners’ are referred to in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 14) in connection with those of the Nīcyas.

apaana|अपान
अपान<BR> --The word appears repeatedly in the Atharvaveda, 1) Av. ii. 28, 3; v. 30, 12, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 19; 24, etc. and later as one of the vital breaths (Prāṇa), usually with Prāṇa, and often with one or more of the other three. Its original sense 2) See Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, lv. 261; 56, 556-558, correcting Ewing, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 22, 249 et seq. appears to have been ‘inspiration.’ Its connection with the lower part of the body (nābhi, ‘navel’), which is found already in the Aitareya Upaniṣad, 3) Aitareya Upaniṣad, i. 4, etc. Cf. Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 263 et seq. is not unnatural.

apaamaarga|अपामार्ग
अपा-मार्ग<BR> --A plant (Achyranthes aspera) used frequently 1) Atharvaveda, iv. 17, 6; 18, 7; 19, 4; vii. 65, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxv. 11; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 1, 8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 4, 14; xiii. 8, 4, 4. in witchcraft practices, and for medical purposes, especially against Kṣetriya. It is described in the Atharvaveda 2) iv. 17, 2. as ‘revertive’ (punaḥ-sara), either, as Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 67. think, because of its having reverted leaves (a view also accepted by Whitney 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 180. ), or because, as Bloomfield 6) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 394. Cf. Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 160, 161; Weber Indische Studien, 18, 94. holds, it wards off a spell by causing it to recoil on its user.

apalamba|अपलम्ब
अप-लम्ब<BR> --By this word 1) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 4, 13. Cf. Caland and Henry, L'Agniṣṭoma, 50; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 79. is denoted a brake or drag, let down (from lamb, ‘hang down’) to check the speed of a wagon.

apaaShTha|अपाष्ठ
अपाष्ठ<BR> --This word occurs twice in the Atharvaveda, 1) iv. 6, 5; v. 18, 7 (śatāpāṣṭha, ‘huṅdred-barbed’). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 300; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 375. denoting the barb of an arrow.

apisharvara|अपिशर्वर
अपि-शर्वर<BR> See Anan.

apii|अपी
अपी<BR> --Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158, 159. finds an Apī whose sons are described as not performing sacrifice (a-yajña-sāc) and as breakers of the law of Mitra-Varuṇa in the Rigveda. 2) vi. 67, 9. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., apya. and Grassmann take the expression used (apyaḥ putrāḥ) as referring to the sons of the waters.

apuupa|अपूप
अपूप<BR> is the general word from the Rigveda 1) iii. 52, 7. onwards for a cake, which might be mixed with ghee (ghṛtavant), 2) Rv. x. 45, 9. or be made of rice (vrīhi), 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 3, 12, 13. or of barley (yava). 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 2, 5, 19. In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5) iii. 1, 1. there is a difference of interpretation. Max Müller renders it as ‘hive,’ Böhtlingk as ‘honeycomb,’ Little 6) Grammatical Index, s.v. as ‘cake.’

apnavaana|अप्नवान
अप्नवान<BR> appears only twice in the Rigveda 1) iv. 7, 1; viii. 91, 4. as an ancient sage, coupled with the Bhṛgus, to whose family Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 128. conjectures him to have belonged. 

apratiratha|अप्रतिरथ
अ-प्रति-रथ<BR> (‘he who has no match in fight’) is the name of an obviously invented Ṛṣi, to whom is ascribed by the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) viii. 10. and Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) ix. 2, 3, 1. 5. the composition of a Rigveda hymn 3) x. 103. celebrating Indra as the invincible warrior.

apvaa|अप्वा
अप्वा<BR> --A disease affecting the stomach, 1) Av. ix. 8, 9. possibly dysentery, as suggested by Zimmer, 2) Altindisches Leben, 389. on the ground that the disease is invoked to confound the enemy. 3) Rv. x. 103, 12 = Av. iii. 2, 5 = Sāmaveda, ii. 1211 = Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvii. 44. Weber 4) Indische Studien, 9, 482; 17, 184. considers that it is diarrhœa induced by fear, as often in the Epic. 5) Indische Studien, 17, 184. This view is supported by Bloomfield, 6) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 327. and was apparently that of Yāska. 7) Nirukta, ix. 33. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 86, 87.

apsas|अप्सस्
अप्सस्<BR> --This word usually refers to the body, meaning ‘front part.’ 1) See Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 308-313; 2, 245, 246. In one passage of the Rigveda, 2) i. 122, 15. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. however, the adjective ‘with a long front part’ (dīrghāpsas) is applied to the chariot (Ratha).

abhikroshaka|अभिक्रोशक
अभि-क्रोशक<BR> designates one of the victims in the Puruṣamedha, meaning, perhaps, ‘herald.’ The commentator Mahīdhara 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 20. Cf. Anukrośaka, Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 15, 1. renders it as ‘reviler’ (nindaka).

abhijit|अभिजित्
अभि-जित्<BR> See Nakṣatra.

abhipitva|अभिपित्व
अभि-पित्व<BR> See Ahan.

abhiprataarinkaaxaseni|अभिप्रतारिन्काक्षसेनि
अभि-प्रतारिन् काक्ष-सेनि<BR> is mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, 1) i. 59, 1; iii. 1, 21; 2, 2. 13. the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 2) iv. 3, 5. and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 3) x. 5, 7; xiv. 1, 12. 15. as engaged in discussions on philosophy. The Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa 4) iii. 156 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 61). further reports that his sons divided the property amongst themselves while he was yet alive. He was a Kuru and a prince. 

abhiprashnin|अभिप्रश्निन्
अभि-प्रश्निन्<BR> --This term occurs after Praśnin, and followed by Praśnavivāka in the list of victims for the Puruṣamedha given in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 1) iii. 4, 6, 1. and the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 2) xxx. 10. The commentators, Sāyaṇa and Mahīdhara, see in it merely a reference to an inquisitive man. But there can be little doubt that the term must have had a legal reference of some sort-perhaps indicating the defendant as opposed to plaintiff and judge.

abhishrii|अभिश्री
अभि-श्री<BR> (‘admixture’).--This word 1) Rv. ix. 79, 5; 86, 27. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 227; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, i. 211. designates the milk used to mingle with the Soma juice before it was offered.

abhiShavaNii|अभिषवणी
अभि-षवणी<BR> --Zimmer 1) Altindisches Leben, 277. renders the expression in the Atharvaveda 2) ix. 6, 16. as a pressing instrument, but it appears to be merely an adjective, (waters) ‘used in pressing.’ 3) Cf. Whitney's Translation of Av. ix. 6, 16.

abhiSheka|अभिषेक
अभि-षेक<BR> (‘besprinkling’).--The Vedic king was consecrated after his election with an elaborate ritual, which is fully described in the Taittirīya, 1) i. 7, 5. Pañcaviṃśa, 2) xviii. 8 et seq. Śatapatha, 3) v. 3, 3 et seq. and Aitareya Brāhmaṇas, 4) viii. 5 et seq. and for which the Mantras are given in the Saṃhitās. 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 11; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 6; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 1-4. The consecration took place by sprinkling with water (abhiṣecanīyā āpaḥ). 6) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 5, 10-15, Only kings could be consecrated, the people not being worthy of it (anabhiṣecanīyāḥ). 7) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 2, 17. The sprinkler (abhiṣektṛ) is mentioned in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha. 8) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 12; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 8, 1. The Abhiṣeka is an essential part of the Rājasūya, or sacrifice of royal inauguration, being the second of its component members. 9 Cf. Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 143-147; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, xxvi; Weber, U7ber den Rājasūya. 

abhiishu|अभीशु
अभीशु<BR> is a common Vedic word 1) Rv. i. 38, 12; v. 44, 4; vi. 75, 6; viii. 33, 11; Av. vi. 137, 2; viii. 8, 22; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 3, 14 (where it = raśmayaḥ, ‘reins’), etc. denoting the ‘reins’ or ‘bridle’ of the chariot horses. The use of the plural is due to the fact that two or four horses, possibly five (daśābhīśu ‘tenbridled’), 2) Rv. x. 94, 7. were yoked to the car.

abhyagniaitashaayana|अभ्यग्निऐतशायन
अभ्य्-अग्नि ऐतशायन<BR> --This man was, according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 1) vi. 33. unfortunate enough to quarrel with his father, Aitaśa. The result was that he and his progeny were called the worst of the Aurvas. In the version of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, 2) xxx. 5. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 173. the Aitaśāyana Ājāneyas take the place of the Abhyagnis and the Bhṛgus of the Aurvas, the latter being probably a branch of the former family.

abhyaavartinchaayamaana|अभ्यावर्तिन्चायमान
अभ्या-वर्तिन् चायमान<BR> appears in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda, 1) vi. 27, 8. 5. and as conqueror of the Vṛcīvants under the leader Varaśikha. It is probable though not absolutely certain, that he is identical with the Sṛñjaya Daivavāta, mentioned in the same hymn 2) vi. 27, 7. as having the Turvaśas and Vṛcīvants defeated for him by Indra. In this case he would be prince (samrāj) of the Sṛñjayas. Daivavāta is mentioned elsewhere 3) iv. 15, 4. as a worshipper of Agni. Abhyāvartin is also referred to as a Pārthava. Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 198 et seq. and Hillebrandt 5) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105; 3, 268, n. 1. Cf. Grierson, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 604 et seq. maintained that he is thus a Parthian, the latter using the evidence of the two places mentioned in the description 6) Rv. vi. 27, 5. 6. of Daivavāta's victories, Hariyūpīyā and Yavyāvatī, as proofs for the western position of Abhyāvartin's people in Arachosia, in Iran. But Zimmer 7) Altindisches Leben, 133 et seq., 433; Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 2, 362. is probably right in holding that the name Pārthava merely means ‘a descendant of Pṛthu,’ and that its similarity to the Iranian Parthians is only on a par with the numerous other points of identity between the Indian and Iranian cultures. 

abhraataraH|अभ्रातरः
अ-भ्रातरः<BR> (‘brotherless’).--The lot of girls without brothers is referred to in the Rigveda 1) i. 124, 7; iv. 5, 5. Cf. Av. i. 17, 1. as unsatisfactory--apparently they became prostitutes. The Nirukta 2) iii. 5 (abhrātrī). Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 259; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 328. expressly forbids marriage with a brotherless maiden, probably because of the risk of her being made a putrikā (‘adoptive daughter’) by her father--that is, any son of hers being counted as belonging to her father's, instead of to her husband's, family. See Ayogū.

abhri|अभ्रि
अभ्रि<BR> (‘spade’) is a Vedic word 1) Av. iv. 7, 5. 6 (abhri-khāte is ‘dug out with a spade,’ not ‘prepared ground’ with Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.); x. 4, 14; hiraṇyayībhir abhribhiḥ, ‘with golden spades’); Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, v. 22; xi. 10; xxxvii. 1; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 2, 15, etc. of frequent occurrence. Various possible materials and forms are enumerated in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 2) vi. 3, 1, 30 et seq. It may be made of bamboo or of the wood of Vikaṅkata or Udumbara. It may be a span or a cubit in size. It is hollow, and either one or both edges are sharp. From this it would appear that the handle was made of some wood, but the head of some metal.

amatra|अमत्र
अमत्र<BR> was a vessel into which the Soma, after being pressed, was poured, 1) Rv. ii. 14, 1; v. 51, 4; vi. 42, 2, etc. and out of which the libation to the god was made. 2) Rv. x. 29, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 278; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda Noten, 1, 61.

amalaa|अमला
अमला<BR> --This plant 1) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 38, 6. is probably the Emblica officinalis, or Myrobalan tree; also called Āmalaka, or Āmalakā. 2) The reading in Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vii. 3, 1, is vāmalake, which may give a¤° or ā°.

amaajur|अमाजुर्
अमा-जुर्<BR> is an epithet 1) Rv. ii. 17, 7; viii. 21, 15; x. 37, 3. denoting maidens ‘who grow old at home’ without finding husbands, or, as they are elsewhere called, ‘who sit with their father’ (pitṛ-ṣad). A well-known example of such was Ghoṣā. 2) Rv. i. 117, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 305. 

amaavaasyashaaNdilyaayana|अमावास्यशाण्दिल्यायन
अमा-वास्य शाण्दिल्यायन<BR> is mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) Indische Studien, iv. 373. as the teacher of Aṃśu Dhānaṃjayya.

amitratapanashuShmiNashaibya|अमित्रतपनशुष्मिणशैब्य
अमित्र-तपन शुष्मिण शैब्य<BR> is the name of him who killed Atyarāti Jānaṃtapi, according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 23).

amuulaa|अमूला
अ-मूला<BR> (‘without root’) is the name in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 314. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 286; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 279, accepts ‘rootless (plant).’ of a plant (Methonica superba), which was used for poisoning arrows. Bloomfield, 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 457. however, renders it as ‘movable property.’

ambariiSha|अम्बरीष
अम्बरीष<BR> is mentioned as a Vārṣāgira in the Rigveda 1) i. 100, 17. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 140. along with Ṛjrāśva, Sahadeva, Surādhas, and Bhayamāna.

ambaShTha|अम्बष्ठ
अम्बष्ठ<BR> See Āmbaṣṭhya.

aya|अय
अय<BR> See Akṣa.

ayas|अयस्
अयस्<BR> --The exact metal denoted by this word when used by itself, as always in the Rigveda, 1) Rv. i. 57, 3; 163, 9; iv. 2, 17; vi. 3, 5. is uncertain. As favouring the sense of ‘bronze’ rather than that of ‘iron’ may perhaps be cited with Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 52. the fact that Agni is called ayo-daṃṣṭra, ‘with teeth of Ayas,’ 3) Rv. i. 88, 5; x. 87, 2. with reference to the colour of his flames, and that the car-seat of Mitra and Varuṇa is called ayaḥ-sthūṇa, 4) Rv. v. 62, 8 (cf. 7). ‘with pillars of Ayas’ at the setting of the sun. 5) But this is not convincing, as in the same verse it is said to be ‘of golden appearance at the flush of dawn.’ Moreover, in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 6) xviii. 13. Ayas is enumerated in a list of six metals: gold (hiraṇya), Ayas, Śyāma, Loha, lead (sīsa), tin (trapu). Here śyāma (‘swarthy’) and loha (‘red’) must mean ‘iron’ and ‘copper’ respectively; ayas would therefore seem to mean ‘bronze.’ In many passages in the Atharvaveda 7) xi. 3, 1. 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 9. and other books, the Ayas is divided into two species--the śyāma (‘iron’) and the lohita (‘copper’ or ‘bronze’). In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 8) v. 4, 1, 2. a distinction is drawn between Ayas and lohāyasa, which may either be a distinction between iron and copper as understood by Eggeling, 9) Sacred Books of the East, 41, 90 or between copper and bronze as held by Schrader. 10) Prehistoric Antiquities, 189. In one passage of the Atharvaveda, 11) v. 28, 1. the sense of iron seems certain. Possibly, too, the arrow of the Rigveda, 12) vi. 75, 15. which had a tip of Ayas (yasyā ayo mukham), was pointed with iron. Copper, however, is conceivable, and bronze quite likely. Iron is called śyāma ayas or śyāma alone. 13) Av. ix. 5, 4. See also Kārṣṇāyasa. Copper is Lohāyasa or Lohitāyasa. The smelting (dhmā ‘to blow’) of the metal is frequently referred to. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 14) vi. 1, 3, 5. Cf. vi. 1, 1, 13; v. 1, 2, 14; xii. 7, 1, 7; 2, 10, etc. states that if ‘well smelted’ (bahu-dhmātam) it is like gold, referring evidently to bronze. A heater of Ayas is mentioned in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 15) xxx. 14; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 10, 1. and bowls of Ayas are also spoken of. 16) Av. viii. 10, 22; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 13.

ayasthuuNa|अयस्थूण
अय-स्थूण<BR> --He was Gṛhapati (‘householder,’ the sacrificer at sacrificial sessions) of those whose Adhvaryu was Śaulvāyana, and taught the latter the proper mode of using certain spoons. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 4, 2, 17 et seq.

ayaasyaaangirasa|अयास्यआङ्गिरस
अयास्य आङ्गिरस<BR> --This sage appears to be mentioned in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) x. 67, 1; 108, 8. Perhaps x. 92. 15 also refers to him, but not i. 62, 7; x. 138, 4. and the Anukramaṇī ascribes to him several hymns of the Rigveda (ix. 44-46; x. 67; 68). In the Brāhmaṇa tradition he was Udgātṛ at the Rājasūya or Royal Inauguration Sacrifice, at which Śunaḥśepa was to have been slain, and his Udgītha (Sāmaveda chant) is referred to elsewhere. 3) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 2. 6; 8, 3. Cf. Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 2, 12. He is also referred to several times as a ritual 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 16. authority. 4) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 3, 22; xvi. 12, 4; xi. 8, 10; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 3, 8. 19. 24; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxx. 6. In the Vaṃśas, or Genealogies of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 5) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 (in both recensions). Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 136; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 159; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 255, n.; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 3, 204. he is named as the pupil of Ābhūti Tvāṣṭra.

ayoguu|अयोगू
अयोगू<BR> is a word of quite doubtful meaning, found in the list of victims in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 1) xxx. 5; Taithrīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 1, 1. It may, like the late āyogava, denote a member of a mixed caste (theoretically a descendant of a Śūdra by a Vaiśya wife). 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Weber 3) Indische Streifen, 1, 76, n. b. In the Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 18, 277, he thought it referred to dicing (ayas). Risley, Peoples of India, 250, regards the Āyogavas as a functional caste of carpenters (cf. Manu, x. 48). rendered it as ‘unchaste woman.’ 4) Altindisches Leben, 328. Zimmer thinks it denotes a brotherless maiden who is exposed to the dangers of prostitution (cf. āyogava).

ara|अर
अर<BR> See Ratha.

araTu|अरटु
अरटु<BR> --A plant 1) Av. xx. 131, 17. (Colosanthes Indica) from the wood of which the axle of a chariot was sometimes made. 2) Rv. viii. 46, 27. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62, 247.

araNya|अरण्य
अरण्य<BR> --This term denotes the uncultivated land--not necessarily forest land--beyond the village. It is contrasted with home (amā), 1) Rv. vi. 24, 10. and with the plough land (kṛṣi), 2) Av. ii. 4, 5. being spoken of as apart (tiras) from men. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 6, 2, 20. It is also contrasted with the Grāma, 4) Av. xii. 1, 56; Rv. i. 163, 11; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 45; xx. 17. and it is the place where thieves live. 5) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 3, 5; xiii. 2, 4, 4. The character of the forest is described in a hymn of the Rigveda 6) x. 146. to the forest spirit (Araṇyānī). The dead are carried there for burial, 7) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, v. 11. and hermits live there. 8) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 5, 3. Forest fires were common. 9) Rv. i. 65, 4; 94, 10. 11; ii. 14, 2; x. 92, 1; 142, 4; Av. vii. 50, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 48, 142. 

aratni|अरत्नि
अरत्नि<BR> --This word, which primarily means ‘elbow,’ occurs frequently from the Rigveda 1) Rv. viii. 80, 8; Av. xix. 57, 6; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 3, 1, 33, etc. For Rv. viii. 80, 8, see also Āji. onwards as denoting a measure of length (‘ell’ or ‘cubit’), the distance from the elbow to the tip of the hand. The exact length nowhere appears from the early texts.

araajaanaH|अराजानः
अ-राजानः,<BR> ‘not princes,’ is a term used to describe persons in two passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) iii. 4, 1, 7. 8; xiii. 4, 2, 17. and in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 2) viii. 23. Weber 3) Indische Studien, 17, 199. also finds them mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 4) iii. 5, 7, where he emends rājānaḥ to a-rājānaḥ (see Whitney's note on the passage). Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveḍa, 333; Weber, U7ber den Rājasūya, 22 et seq. and thinks that they--Sūtas (‘charioteers’) and Grāmaṇīs (‘troop-leaders’) there referred to--were called thus because, while not themselves princes, they assisted in the consecration of princes.

araaTakii|अराटकी
अराटकी<BR> is a plant mentioned once in the Atharvaveda, 1) iv. 37, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 68; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 408. and apparently identical with the Ajaśṛṅgī. Cf. also Araṭu.

araaDadaatreyashaunaka|अराडदात्रेयशौनक
अराड दात्रेय शौनक<BR> --He is mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) Indische Studien, 4, 384. as the pupil of Dṛti Aindrota Śaunaka.

aritra|अरित्र
अरित्र<BR> denotes the ‘oar’ by which boats were propelled. The Rigveda 1) i. 116, 5. and the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 2) xxi. 7. speak of a vessel with a hundred oars, and a boat (nau) is said to be ‘propelled by oars’ (aritra-paraṇa). 3) Rv. x. 101, 2. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 2, 5, 10. In two passages of the Rigveda 4) i. 46, 8; daśāritra, ii. 18, 1. the term, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, denotes a part of a chariot. The rower of a boat is called aritṛ. 5) Rv. ii. 42, 1; ix. 95, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 256. See Nau. 

ariMdamasanashruta|अरिंदमसनश्रुत
अरिं-दम सन-श्रुत<BR> is mentioned as a Mahārāja in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 34.

arimejaya|अरिमेजय
अरिम्-एजय<BR> is mentioned as one who served as Adhvaryu at the snake feast celebrated in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 15. See Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

aruNaaaTa|अरुणआट
अरुण आट<BR> was Achāvāka at the snake feast in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xxv. 15).

aruNaaupaveshigautama|अरुणऔपवेशिगौतम
अरुण औपवेशि गौतम<BR> is the full style 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 9, 2; 4, 5, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 4, 10; iii. 6, 4. 6; 7, 4; 8, 6; 10, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvi. 10. of a teacher, who is repeatedly referred to in the later Saṃhitās 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 5, 11; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 2, 20; xi. 4, 1, 4; 5, 3, 2. and Brāhmaṇas, 3) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 5, 3 (in both recensions). and whose son was the famous Uddālaka Āruṇi. He was a pupil of Upaveśa, 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 6, 1, 2. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 146, n.^4 and a contemporary of the prince Aśvapati, by whom he was instructed. Cf. Āruṇa.

arundhatii|अरुन्धती
1. Arundhatī is the name of a plant celebrated in several passages of the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 12, 1; v. 5, 5. 9; vi. 59, 1. 2; viii. 7, 6; xix. 38, 1. as possessing healing properties in case of wounds, as a febrifuge, and as inducing cows to give milk. The plant was a climber which attached itself to trees like the Plakṣa, Aśvattha, Nyagrodha, and Parṇa. 2) Av. v. 5, 5. It was of golden colour (hiraṇya-varṇā), and had a hairy stem (lomaśavakṣaṇā). 3) Av. v. 5, 7; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 174; Bloomfield, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 574. It was also called Silācī, and the Lākṣā appears to have been a product of it. 4) Cf. Whitney's note on Av. iv. 12; Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 61.

arundhatii|अरुन्धती
2. Arundhatī, as the name of a star, is often referred to in the Sūtra literature, but only once in a late Āraṇyaka. 1) Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iii. 9, 2. 

arka|अर्क
अर्क,<BR> as the name of the tree Colotropis gigantea, is perhaps found in one obscure passage of the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 72, 1, where see Whitney's note. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

argala|अर्गल
अर्गल<BR> --The word which is usual later to denote the wooden pin of a door is found in the Śāṇkhāyana Āraṇyaka (ii. 16) in the compound argaleṣīke to denote the pin and bar of the door of a cow-pen. Cf. Iṣīkā.

argalakaahoDi|अर्गलकाहोडि
अर्गल-काहोडि<BR> is mentioned in the Kāṭhaka Samhitā (xxv. 7) as a teacher. The name may, however, be Aryala, as suggested in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and as read by v. Schroeder in his edition. The Kapiṣṭhala (xxxix. 5) has Ayala. See below.

archant|archat|अर्चत्|अर्चन्त्
अर्चन्त्<BR> is possibly, as Ludwig 1) Translation of the Ṛgveda, 3, 133. thinks, the name of the author of a hymn of the Rigveda 2) x. 149, 5. ; but the word may be merely the ordinary participle ‘praising.’

archanaanas|अर्चनानस्
अर्चनानस्<BR> --In one passage of the Rigveda 1) v. 64, 7. the gods MitraVaruṇa are besought to protect Arcanānas. He is also invoked with Śyāvāśva and several other ancestors enumerated in the Atharvaveda. 2) xviii. 3, 15. He appears as father of Śyāvāśva in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 3) viii. 5, 9. The later tradition makes him play a part in the legend of his son's wedding, which Sieg 4) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 50 et seq. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 127; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 354. endeavours to show is known to the Rigveda.

archaa|अर्चा
अर्चा<BR> See Brāhmaṇa.

arjunii|अर्जुनी
अर्जुनी<BR> is, in the Rigveda, 1) x. 85, 13. the name of the Nakṣatra (‘lunar mansion’), elsewhere 2) Av. xiv. 1, 13. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 11, 2. called Phalgunī. It occurs in the marriage hymn, with Aghā for Maghā, and, like that word, is apparently a deliberate modification. 

arbuda|अर्बुद
अर्बुद<BR> is mentioned as Grāvastut priest at the snake festival described in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 15. He is obviously the same mythical figure as Arbuda Kādraveya, a seer spoken of in the Aitareya 2) vi. 1. and Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇas 3) xxix. 1. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 3, 9. as a maker of Mantras.

arya|अर्य
अर्य<BR> --This word is not common in the older literature, in places where the quantity of the first vowel is fixed as short, except in a mere adjectival sense. Geldner, 1) Vedische Studien, 3, 96. indeed, contends that no other sense is anywhere needed; but Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 214, 215. agree in thinking that in several passages of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 4) xiv. 30; xx. 17; xxiii. 21; xxvi. 2. Cf. also Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxviii. 5; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 19, 3. In Atharvaveda, xix. 32, 8, an analogous form occurs, as contrasted with brāhmaṇa, rājanya, and śūdra; but even there Whitney renders it as ‘Āryan.’ Cf. xix. 62, 1; Rv. viii. 94, 3; Pischel, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 40, 125. the word has the same sense as Ārya, and this appears probable. Whether it is necessary to ascribe this sense to the word in the compound arya-patnī 5) Rv. vii. 6, 5; x. 43, 8. applied to the waters set free by Indra, is more doubtful. The commentator, Mahīdhara, 6) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 30. suggests that the word means a Vaiśya, not an Ārya generally. This view is supported by the explanation in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 7) xiii. 2, 9, 8. Contrast Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xvi. 4, 4 et seq., where Arya appears to be taken in the wider sense. of one of the passages of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 8) xxiii. 30. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 212; Weber, Indische Studien, x. 6; Oldenberg, ṚgvedaNoten, 1, 126, 363. But though the use of Arya to denote a Vaiśya became common later, it is not clear that it was original.

aryamNaHpanthaa|अर्यम्णःपन्था
अर्यम्णः पन्था,<BR> ‘Aryaman's Way,’ an expression which occurs in the Brāhmaṇas, 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 6, 6; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 12, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 1, 2. denotes, according to Weber, 2) U7ber den Rājasūya, 48, 2. ‘the milky way,’ but, according to Hillebrandt, 3) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 79, 80. ‘the ecliptic.’ 

aryala|अर्यल
अर्यल<BR> --Those at whose snake feast the Gṛhapati was Aryala, and the Hotṛ was Āruṇi are mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xxiii. 1, 5). See also Argala.

arvant|arvat|अर्वत्|अर्वन्त्
अर्वन्त्<BR> See Aśva.

arshas|अर्शस्
अर्शस्<BR> is the name of a disease mentioned in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 1) xii. 98. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 398; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. with consumption and other ailments. It appears to designate ‘hæmorrhoids,’ as in the later medical literature.

alaja|अलज
अलज<BR> designates some kind of bird--one of the victims in the Aśvamedha, 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 4, 11, 1; 5, 20, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 18; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxi. 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 34. or Horse Sacrifice.

alaji|अलजि
अलजि<BR> is the name of a disease in the Atharvaveda. 1) ix. 8, 20. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 390; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. The later alajī denotes an eye-disease--a discharge at the junction of the cornea and the sclerotica.

alammapaarijaanata|अलम्मपारिजानत
अलम्म पारिजानत<BR> is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 4, 11; 10, 8) as a sage.

alasaalaa|अलसाला
अलसाला<BR> --This word occurring only in one passage of the Atharvaveda (vi. 16, 4) is said to denote a grain-creeper.

alaaNDu|अलाण्डु
अलाण्डु<BR> --This is the reading in the text of the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 31, 2. of the name of a species of worm. Bloomfield 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 315. shows reason to adopt the reading Algaṇḍu as the correct form of the word.

alaabu|अलाबु
अलाबु<BR> --The bottle-gourd (Lagenaria vulgaris). Vessels made of it are referred to in the Atharvaveda. 1) viii. 10, 29. 30; xx. 132, 1. 2. Cf. alāpu in Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 13.

alaayya|अलाय्य
अलाय्य<BR> is a word occurring in an obscure verse of the Rigveda, 1) ix. 67, 20. and appearing to be a proper name. Hillebrandt, 2) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 418. however, amends the text so as to remove the name. The St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests that it refers to Indra. Pischel 3) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 701. holds that it is the name of a person whose axe was stolen, and for whom the hymn was written as a spell for the recovery of the axe.

aliklava|अलिक्लव
अलिक्लव<BR> is a kind of carrion bird mentioned in the Atharvaveda. 1) xi. 2, 2; 9, 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 88.

alina|अलिन
अलिन<BR> is the name of a people mentioned once only in the Rigveda. 1) vii. 18, 7. Roth 2) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 95; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 126. thought that the Alinas were allies--possibly a subdivision--of the Tṛtsus. Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 207. more probably thinks that they were defeated by Sudās, together with the Pakthas, Bhalānas, Śivas, and Viṣāṇins, with whom they are mentioned, at the Paruṣṇī; and Zimmer 4) Op. cit., 431. The land is mentioned by Hiouen Thsang. suggests that they lived to the north-east of Kafiristan.

aliikayuvaachaspatya|अलीकयुवाचस्पत्य
अलीकयु वाचस्-पत्य<BR> is twice mentioned as an authority in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (xxvi. 5; xxviii. 4).

alpashayu|अल्पशयु
अल्प-शयु<BR> is a kind of insect mentioned in the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 36, 9. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 408; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 210.

avakaa|अवका
अवका<BR> is an aquatic plant (Blyxa octandra) frequently referred to in the Atharvaveda as well as in the later Saṃhitās 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 6, 1, 1; v. 4, 2, 1; 4, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvii. 4; xxv. 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 10, 1. and Brāhmaṇas. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 5, 1, 11; viii. 3, 2, 5; ix. 1, 2, 20. 22; xiii. 8, 3, 13. The Gandharvas are said to eat it. 4) Av. iv. 37, 8. Its later name is śaivala, and it is identical with the Śīpāla. 1) viii. 7, 9; 37, 8-10. 5) With which it is glossed in Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, ii. 8; iv. 4. Cf. Bloomfield, Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, October, 1890, xli.-xliii.; American Journal of Philology, 11, 349; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71.

avata|अवत
अवत,<BR> a word occurring several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 55, 8; 85, 10. 11; 116, 9, 22; 130, 2; iv. 17, 16; 50, 3; viii. 49, 6; 62, 6; 72, 10, 12; x. 25, 4; 101, 5. 7. Cf. Nirukta, v. 26. denotes a well, artificially made (khan ‘to dig’) in contrast with a spring (utsa), though the latter expression is also applied to an artificial well. Such wells were covered by the makers, 2) Rv. i. 55, 8. and are described as unfailing (a-kṣita) and full of water. 3) Rv. x. 101, 6, etc. The water was raised by a wheel (cakra) of stone, to which was fastened a strap (varatrā), with a pail (kośa) 4) Aṃsatra-kośam, Rv. x. 101, 7, is best thus rendered. For the stone wheel (aśma-cakra) which was above (uccācakra), see Rv. x. 101, 7; viii. 72, 10. For the varatrā, see Rv. x. 101, 6. Perhaps kū-cakra in Rv. x. 102, 11, is another name for the wheel, but cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. attached to it. When raised it was poured (siñc) into buckets (āhāva) of wood. 5) Rv. x. 101, 6. 7. Sometimes those wells appear to have been used for irrigation purposes, the water being led off into broad channels (sārmī suṣirā). 6) Rv. viii. 69, 12. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 156, 157; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 14.

avatsaara|अवत्सार
अवत्सार<BR> is mentioned as a seer in the Rigveda, 1) v. 44. 10. as a priest in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 2) ii. 24. and as Prāsravaṇa (or Prāśravaṇa), son of Prasravaṇa, in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa. 3) xiii. 3. A hymn of the Rigveda 4) ix. 58. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 188; 2, 315; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 62, et seq. is incorrectly ascribed to him in the Anukramaṇī.

avadhyataa|अवध्यता
अ-वध्यता<BR> See Brāhmaṇa.

avasa|अवस
अवस<BR> in the adjective an-avasa in the Rigveda 1) vi. 66, 7. Cf. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 372. may mean ‘drag.’

avaskava|अवस्कव
अव-स्कव<BR> --A kind of worm, mentioned along with others in the Atharvaveda. 1) ii. 31, 4. Cf. Whitney, ad loc.; Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 201; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 90; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 316.

avaata|अवात
अवात<BR> See Vāta.

avi|अवि
अवि<BR> --‘Sheep’ are repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda, and later, often in conjunction with goats (aja). The wolf (vṛka) was their great enemy, 1) Av. v. 8, 4; Rv. viii. 34, 3; 66, 8. and they were tended by shepherds. 2) Avi-pāla, Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 11; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 5, 2; avi-pa, Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 9, 1. Sheep as well as kine were captured from the enemy. 3) Rv. viii. 86, 2. The Soma sieve was made of sheep's wool, and is repeatedly referred to (avi, meṣī, avya, avyaya). 4) Rv. ix. 109, 16; 36, 4, etc. See Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 203. Considerable herds must have existed, as Ṛjrāśva is said 5) Rv. i. 116, 17. to have slain one hundred rams, and in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) 6) Rv. viii. 67, 3. a hundred sheep are mentioned as a gift. The (meṣa, 7) Rv. i. 43, 6; 116, 16, etc. vṛṣṇi 8) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 7, 4, etc. ) ram was sometimes castrated (petva). 9) Rv. vii. 18, 17; Av. iv. 4, 8; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 22, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxix. 58; 59. The main use of sheep was their wool; hence the expression ‘woolly’ (ūrṇāvatī) 10) Rv. viii. 67, 3. Cf. x. 75, 8; so urā, x. 95, 3. is employed to designate a sheep. In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 11) xiii. 50. the ram is described as ‘woolly,’ and as ‘the skin of beasts, quadruped and biped,’ with reference to the use of its wool as clothing for men and shelter for animals. Pūṣan is said 12) Rv. x. 26, 6. to weave raiment from the wool of sheep. Normally the sheep stayed out at pasture; in an obscure passage of the Rigveda 13) x. 106, 5. reference appears to be made to rams in stall. Gandhāra 14) Rv. i. 126, 7. ewes were famous for their wool. Pischel 15) Vedische Studien, 2, 210. considers that the Paruṣṇī 16) Rv. iv. 22, 2; v. 52, 9. was named from its richness in sheep, parus 17) Rv. ix. 15, 6; parvan, iv. 22, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 229, 230; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 348. denoting the ‘flocks’ of wool.

ashani|अशनि
अशनि<BR> --Zimmer 1) Altindisches Leben, 301. cites this word from the Rigveda 2) vi. 6, 5. Cf. 1, 121, 9. as denoting a sling stone, and compares a similar use of Adri. 3) i. 51, 3. In either case, however, the weapons are mythical, being used in descriptions of Indra's deeds. Schrader 4) Prehistoric Antiquities, 221. also cites aśan in this sense, but no Vedic passage requires this sense.

ashmagandhaa|अश्मगन्धा
अश्म-गन्धा<BR> (‘rock-smell’) is a plant mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) xiii. 8, 1, 16, with Eggeling's note in the Sacred Books of the East, 44, 427. probably identical with the late aśvagandhā, ‘horse-smell’ (Physalis flexuosa). 

ashva|अश्व
अश्व<BR> is the commonest word for ‘horse’ in the Vedic literature. The horse is also called ‘the runner’ (atya), ‘the swift’ (arvant), ‘the strong,’ for pulling (vājin), ‘the runner’ (sapti), and ‘the speeding’ (haya). The mare is termed aśvā, atyā, arvatī, vaḍavā, etc. Horses of various colour were known, dun (harita, hari), ruddy (aruṇa, aruṣa, piśaṅga, rohita), dark brown (śyāva), white (śveta), etc. A white horse with black ears is mentioned in the Atharvaveda as of special value. 1) Av. v. 17, 15. Horses were highly prized, 2) Rv. i. 83, 1; iv. 32, 17; v. 4, 11; viii. 78, 2, etc. and were not rare, as Roth 3) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 35, 686. thought, for as many as four hundred mares are mentioned in one Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’). 4) Rv. viii. 55, 3. Cf. v. 33, 8; vi. 47, 22-24; 63, 10; viii. 6, 47; 46, 22, and Hopkins, American Journal of Philology, 15, 157. They were on occasion ornamented with pearls and gold. 5) Rv. x. 68, 11. Mares were preferred for drawing chariots because of their swiftness and sureness. 6) Pischel, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 35, 712714; Vedische Studien, 1, 10, 305. Cf. ratho vadhūmān, Rv. i. 126, 3; vii. 18, 22, vājinīvān, vii. 69, 1. They were also used for drawing carts, but were not ordinarily so employed. 7) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 4, 35. No mention is made of riding in battle, but for other purposes it was not unknown. 8) The Aśvins ride, Rv. v. 61, 1-3. An aśva-sāda is referred to in Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 13; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 7, 1; and riding is meant in Rv. i. 162, 17; 163, 9. Av. xi. 10, 24. is doubtful. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 262; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 221. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 230, denies the use; but see p. 295, where it is admitted for ordinary purposes. Horses were often kept in stalls, 9) Cf. the epithet of richness, ‘filling the stalls with horses’ (aśva-pastya), in Rv. ix. 86, 41, and see Av. vi. 77, 1; xix. 55, 1. and fed there. 10) Av. loc. cit. But they were also allowed to go out to grass, 11) Zimmer, op. cit., 232, denies this, but it is the natural sense of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xv. 41. and were then hobbled. 12) The expression for this is paḍbīśa, Rv. i. 162, 14. 16; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 2, 13; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 1, 12; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, ix. 7. Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 234-236. They were watered to cool them after racing. 13) Rv. ii. 13, 5; 34, 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 11, 6; Pischel, op. cit., 1, 189, 190. Their attendants are frequently referred to (aśva-pāla, 14) Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xvi. 4, 5. aśva-pa, 15) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 11; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 9, 1. aśva-pati). 16) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 24; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 13. Stallions were frequently castrated (vadhri). 17) Rv. viii. 46, 30. Besides reins (raśmayaḥ), reference is made to halters (aśvābhidhānī), 18) Av. iv. 36, 10; v. 14, 6; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 35; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 3, 1, 26; xiii. 1, 2, 1. and whips (aśvājani). 19) Rv. v. 62, 7; vi. 75, 13; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxix. 50. See also Ratha. Horses from the Indus were of special value, 20) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 2, 13; Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, ix. 7; vājinīvatī as epithet of Sindhu, Rv. x. 75, 8, of Sarasvatī, i. 3, 10; ii. 41, 18; vi. 61, 3. 4; vii. 96, 3; Pischel, op. cit., i. 10. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 230-232. as also horses from the Sarasvatī.

ashvatara|अश्वतर
अश्व-तर, अश्व-तरी<BR> are respectively the masculine and feminine name of ‘mule.’ These animals are mentioned frequently from the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 4, 8; viii. 8, 22; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 47; iv. 9; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 4, 1, 10, etc.; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 4. onwards. They were known not to be fruitful, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 1, 2. 3. Cf. Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa in Indische Studien, 1, 40. and were probably considered inferior to horses, 3) As were asses, Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 2, 2; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 4, 4, 7. but a mule-car was quite common. 4) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 9; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 2, 1 (in both passages aśvatarī-ratha). Cf. Oertel, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 175.

ashvattha|अश्वत्थ
1. Aśva-ttha (‘horse-stand’) is one of India's greatest trees, the Ficus religiosa, later called pippala 1) The word pippala as a neuter occurs once in the Rv. (i. 164, 20) designating the berry of the Peepal-tree. (now Peepal). Vessels made of the wood of the Aśvattha are mentioned in the Rigveda, 2) i. 135, 8; x. 97, 5. and the tree itself is constantly referred to later. 3) Atharvaveda, iii. 6, 1; iv. 37, 4, etc. Its hard wood formed the upper of the two pieces of wood used for kindling fire, the lower being of Śamī. 4) Av. vi. 11, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 1, 13. It planted its roots in shoots of other trees, especially the Khadira, and destroyed them; 5) Av. iii. 6. hence it is called ‘the destroyer’ (vaibādha). Its berries are referred to as sweet, and as eaten by birds. 6) Rv. i. 164, 20. 22. The gods are said to sit under it in the third heaven. 7) Av. v. 4, 3. Cf. Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 5, 3; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, i. 3. It and Nyagrodha are styled the ‘crested ones’ (śikhaṇḍin). 8) Av. iv. 37, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 57, 58.

ashvattha|अश्वत्थ
2. Aśva-ttha.<BR> --This prince is celebrated in a Dānastuti 1) Rv. vi. 47, 24. as having given gifts to Pāyu. He is identified with Divodāsa by Griffith, 2) Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 611. The name is spelt Aśvatha in the text, but that is merely the usual shortened spelling of the group tth. but it is impossible to be certain of this identification.

ashvadaavan|अश्वदावन्
अश्व-दावन्<BR> --Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 274. finds a prince of this name in a passage of the Rigveda, 2) v. 18, 3. where a gift of fifty horses is mentioned, but the word appears to be an epithet of Indra (‘bestower of horses’).

ashvapati|अश्वपति
अश्व-पति<BR> (‘lord of horses’) is a name of a prince of the Kekayas, who instructed Prācīnaśāla and other Brahmins. 1) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 11, 4; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 6, 1, 2.

ashvamedha|अश्वमेध
अश्व-मेध<BR> (‘offering a horse-sacrifice’) is a prince mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda, 1) v. 27, 4-6. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 275. which contains a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) of Tryaruṇa, and to which three verses have been added in praise of Aśvamedha. See also Āśvamedha.

ashvayujau|अश्वयुजौ

अष्टका<BR> See Māsa.

aShTakarNii|अष्टकर्णी
अष्ट-कर्णी<BR> is an expression which occurs in one passage of the Ṛgveda, 1) x. 62, 7. and which Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. was at first inclined to interpret as a proper name. There can, however, be no doubt that it means a cow, not a man, as suggested by Grassmann. The exact reason why a cow should be so described is uncertain. Roth 3) Cf. Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. was later inclined to see in it the sense ‘having pierced ears,’ similar epithets being at a later period known to Pāṇini 4) vi. 3, 115. (bhinna-karṇa, chinna-karṇa). Grassmann's more obvious rendering, ‘having the sign for (the number) 8 marked on the ear,’ is supported by the similar epithets, ‘having the mark of a lute on the ear’ (karkari-karṇyaḥ), ‘having the mark of a sickle on the ear’ (dātra-karṇyaḥ), ‘having the mark of a stake on the ear’ (sthūṇākarṇyaḥ), ‘having the ears bored’ (chidra-karṇyaḥ), and viṣtyakarṇyaḥ, given in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā. 5) iv. 2, 9. The simple meaning, ‘with marked ears,’ is, however, supported by the same passage of the Maitrāyaṇī, where the verb akṣ occurs in the sense ‘to mark.’ In the Atharvaveda the mark used is the Mithuna, no doubt as a magical device to secure fertility. The marking of ears was apparently a regular practice. It is twice referred to in the Atharvaveda. 6) vi. 141, 1. 2; xii. 4, 6. The mark is termed lakṣman, 7) Av. vi. 141, 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, loc. cit. and was made with a copper-knife 8) Av., loc. cit. (lohita). The Maitrayaṇī Saṃhitā 9) Loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 234, 348; Delbrück, Gurupūjākaumudī, 48, 49; Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 466; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 387. forbids the use of an arrow-shaft (tejana), or of iron, but permits that of a stem of sugar-cane (ikṣu-kāṇḍa) or copper.

aShTaadaMShTravairuupa|अष्टादंष्ट्रवैरूप
अष्टा-दंष्ट्र वैरूप<BR> --To him the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (viii. 9, 21) ascribes two Sāmans.

aShTraa|अष्ट्रा
अष्ट्रा<BR> is the plougher's ‘goad,’ the badge of agriculture. It is mentioned several times in the Rigveda. 1) iv. 57, 4; vi. 53, 9; 58, 2; aṣṭrā-vin occurs in x. 102, 8. See also Kauśika Sūtra, 80. Cf. Roscher, Archiv für Religionswissenschaft, 1, 63; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 364, n. 8.

asamaatiraathaprauShTha|असमातिराथप्रौष्ठ
असमाति राथ-प्रौष्ठ<BR> --The story of the quarrel between Asamāti, the Ikṣvāku prince of the Rathaproṣṭha family, and his priests, the Gaupāyanas, is found only in the later Brāhmaṇas. 1) Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 167 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 41 et seq.); Sāṭyāyanaka, cited in Sāyaṇa on Rv. x. 57, 1; 60, 7; Bṛhaddevatā, vii. 83 et seq., with Macdonell's notes; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 12, 5. It appears to be based on a misreading of the Rigveda, 2) x. 60, 2. 5; Av. vi. 79, 1. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 499; Max Müller, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1866, 426-465; Böhtlingk's Dictionary, s.v.; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 48, n. 1. where asamāti is merely an adjective. The later story is that the king was induced to abandon his family priests by two Asuras, Kirāta and Ākuli, who by their magic compassed the death of Subandhu, one of the brother priests, and that the others revived him by the use of the hymns (Rigveda, x. 57-60).

asi|असि
असि<BR> usually denotes the sacrificial knife, 1) Rv. i. 162, 20; x. 79, 6; 18; Av. ix. 3, 9; x. 1, 20, etc. but occasionally appears to mean a knife used in war. 2) Av. xi. 9, 1. The use of the ‘sword’ increases in the Epic period. See Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 284. Mention is made of a sheath (vavri) 3) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 4. to which a belt (vāla) 4) Ibid.; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 5. was attached. The word asi-dhārā 5) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 139. also denotes ‘sheath.’

asiknii|असिक्नी
असिक्नी<BR> (‘black’) is the name in the Rigveda 1) viii. 20, 25; x. 75, 5; Nirukta, ix. 26. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 12. of the river known later as Candra-bhāgā, and to the Greeks as Akesines, now the Chenab in the Punjab.

asita|असित
1. Asita is a name of the ‘black snake,’ referred to in the later Saṃhitās. 1) Av. iii. 27, 1; v. 13, 5. 6; vi. 56, 2, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 10, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 18; perhaps Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 37.

asita|असित
2. Asita.<BR> --(a) A mythical sage of this name figures as a magician in the Atharvaveda in conjunction with Gaya 1) Av. i. 14, 4. or with Jamadagni. 2) Av. vi. 137, 1. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3) xiii. 4, 3, 11. he appears as Asita Dhānva, 4) Dhānvana in the Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xvi. 2, 19. and as Daivala or Devala in the Pañcaviṃsa Brāhmaṇa 5) xiv. 11, 18. 19, Cf. xv. 5, 27. and Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 6) xxii. 11. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 132. (b) Asita Vārṣa-gaṇa is a pupil of Harita Kaśyapa according to the Vaṃśa or Genealogy in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) vi. 5, 3 (Kāṇva = vi. 4, 33, Mādhyandina).

asitamRga|असितमृग
असित-मृग<BR> is the designation in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) vii. 27. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 345. of a family of the Kaśyapas who were excluded from a sacrifice by Janamejaya, but who took away the conduct of the offering from the Bhūtavīras, whom the king employed. In the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa 2) i. 75. and the Ṣaḍviṃsa Brāhmaṇa 3) i. 4. the Asitamṛgas are called ‘sons of the Kaśyapas,’ and one is mentioned as Kusurubindu 4) Variously read as Asurbinda, Kusurbinda, Kusurubinda. Auddālaki.

asuravidyaa|असुरविद्या
असुर-विद्या,<BR> ‘the science of the Asuras,’ the term used in the Śāṅkhāyana and Āśvalāyana 1) x. 7. Śrauta Sūtras as the equivalent of the term māyā employed in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 2) xiii. 4, 3, 11. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 61, 2. 21. clearly means ‘magic,’ as it is rendered by Professor Eggeling. 3) Sacred Books of the East, 44, 368.

astR|अस्तृ
अस्तृ,<BR> ‘shooter,’ is a term frequently used in the Rigveda 1) i. 8, 4; 64, 10; ii. 42, 2, etc. and Atharvaveda 2) vi. 93, 1. 2; xi. 2, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 296. for the archer who fought from the chariot.

ahan|अहन्
अहन्,<BR> ‘day.’ Like other peoples, the Indians used night as a general expression of time as well as day, but by no means predominantly. 1) Rv. iv. 16, 19; viii. 26, 3; i. 70, 4. Cf. Av. x. 7, 42. Night is also termed the dark (kṛṣṇa), as opposed to the light (arjuna), day. 2) Rv. vi. 9. 1. Aho-rātra 3) Rv. x. 190, 2; Av. xiii. 3, 8, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 41, etc. is a regular term for ‘day and night’ combined. The day itself is variously divided. In the Atharvaveda 4) ix. 6, 45. a division into ‘the rising sun’ (udyan sūryaḥ), ‘the coming together of the cows’ (saṃ-gava), ‘midday’ (madhyaṃ-dina), ‘afternoon’ (aparāhṇa), and ‘sunset’ (astaṃ-yan) is found. In the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 5) i. 5, 3, 1; 4, 9, 2. the same series appears with ‘early’ (prātar) and ‘evening’ (sāyāhna) substituted for the first and last members, while a shorter list gives prātar, saṃgava, sāyam. In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 6) iv. 2, 11. there is the series ‘dawn’ (uṣas), saṃgava, madhyaṃdina, and aparāhṇa. The morning is also, according to Zimmer, called api-śarvara, 7) Rv. iii. 9, 7; cf. Oldenberg, ṚgvedaNoten, 1, 230. as the time when the dark is just past. It is named svasara, 8) Rv. ii. 34, 8; ix. 94, 2. as the time when the cows are feeding, before the first milking at the saṃgava, or when the birds are awakening. 9) Rv. ii. 19, 2; 34, 5. It is also called pra-pitva, 10) Rv. vii. 41, 4; viii. 1, 29. Sieg. Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 127 et seq., interprets paritakmyāyām (Rv. i. 116, 15) similarly. according to Zimmer. 11) Altindisches Leben. 362. But Geldner 12) Vedische Studien, 2, 155-179. points out that that term refers to the late midday, which also is called api-śarvara, as bordering on the coming night, being the time when day is hastening to its close, as in a race. From another point of view, evening is called abhi-pitva, 13) Rv. i. 126, 3; iv. 34, 5. the time when all come to rest. Or again, morning and evening are denoted as the dawning of the sun (uditā sūryasya), or its setting (ni-mruc). The midday is regularly madhyam ahnām, 14) Rv. vii. 41, 4. madhye, 15) Rv. viii. 27, 20. or madhyaṃdina. Saṃgava 16) Cf. Rv. v. 76, 3 (saṃgave, prātar ahno, madhyaṃdine); Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 1, 3; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 12, 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 18, 14; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 112, 113. Zimmer, op. cit., 362, places it too early--before the cows are driven out. is the forenoon, between the early morning (prātar) and midday (madhyaṃdina). The divisions of time less than the day are seldom precisely given. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 17) xii. 3, 2, 5. Cf. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 1, 1 et seq. however, a day and night make up 30 muhūrtas; 1 muhūrta = 15 kṣipra; 1 kṣipra = 15 etarhi; 1 etarhi = 15 idāni; 1 idāni = 15 breathings; 1 breathing = 1 spiration; 1 spiration = 1 twinkling (nimeṣa), etc. In the Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 18) vii. 20. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xiv. 78 et seq.; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 92-95. the series is dhvaṃsayo, nimeṣāḥ, kāṣṭhāḥ, kalāḥ, kṣanā, muhūrtā, ahorātrāḥ. A thirtyfold division of day as well as of night is seen in one passage of the Rigveda 19) Rv. i. 123, 8. by Zimmer, who compares the Babylonian sixtyfold division of the day and night. But the expression used-thirty Yojanas--is too vague and obscure--Bergaigne 20) Religion Védique. 3, 283 et seq. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. kratu. refers it to the firmament--to build any theory upon with safety. The longer divisions of time are regularly ‘half month’ (ardha-māsa), ‘month’ (māsa), ‘season’ (ṛtu), and ‘year’ (saṃvatsara), which often 21) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 15; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 12, 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 28; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, vii. 20; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. iii. 8, 9, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 361-363. occur in this sequence after ahorātrāṇi (‘days and nights’).

ahalyaamaitreyii|अहल्यामैत्रेयी
अहल्या मैत्रेयी<BR> is practically a mythical name, the existence of the lady whose story is alluded to in several Brāhmaṇas 1) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 4, 18; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 79; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, i. 1. being derived from the epithet of Indra, ‘lover of Ahalyā’ (ahalyāyai jāra).

ahi|अहि
अहि<BR> --This word occurs frequently from the Rigveda 1) vii. 104, 7, etc. The word sarpa, which is usual in the Atharvaveda, occurs only once (x. 16, 6) in the Rv. onwards to denote ‘snake.’ Reference is several times 2) Rv. ix. 86, 44; Av. i. 27; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 2, 6, 13; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 4, 10; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 9. ii. 139; Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad, ii. 6; 17. made to its casting its slough. Mention is also made of the serpent's peculiar movement, 3) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v. 1, 4. which earns for it the designation 4) Av. iv. 3, 2. of ‘the toothed rope’ (datvatī rajjuḥ). The poisonous character of its bite is spoken of, 5) Rv. vii. 104. 7; Av. x. 4, 4 et seq.; 6, 56. as well as the torpidity of the reptile in winter, when it creeps into the earth. 6) Av. xii. 1, 46. The cast skin is used as an amulet against highwaymen. 7) Av. i. 27. Mention is made of a mythical horse, Paidva, which the Aśvins gave to Pedu as a protection against snakes, 8) Rv. i. 117-119 and which is invoked as a destroyer of serpents. 9) Av. x. 4, 6. 10. The ichneumon (nakula) is regarded as their deadly enemy, and as immune against their poison through the use of a healing plant, 10) Av. vi. 139, 5; viii. 7, 23. while men kill them with sticks 11) Av. x. 4, 9. or strike off their heads. 12) Av. vi. 67, 2. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94, 95. Many species of snakes are mentioned: see Aghāśva, Ajagara, Asita, Kaṅkaparvan, Karikrata, Kalmāṣagrīva, Kasarṇīla, Kumbhīnasa, Tiraścarāji, Taimāta, Darvi, Daśonasi, Puṣkarasāda, Pṛdāku, Lohitāhi, Śarkoṭa, Śvitra, Sarpa.

ahiinaaaashvatthya|अहीनाआश्वत्थ्य

aakramaNa|आक्रमण
आ-क्रमण<BR> --In the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa^1 (i. 3) this word is used with the specific sense of ‘steps to climb trees.’ 

aakhu|आखु
आखु<BR> --The exact sense of this word is uncertain. Zimmer 1) Altindisches Leben, 84, 85, followed by Bloomfield. Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 142. renders it ‘mole,’ while Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., followed by Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 317, 318. prefers ‘mouse’ or ‘rat.’ It is frequently mentioned in the later Saṃhitās, 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 14, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14. 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 57; xxiv. 26; 28; Av. vi. 50, 1. and is known to the Rigveda, 4) ix. 67, 30. where, however, the word is regarded by Pischel 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 246; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 701. as having acquired the secondary sense of ‘thief.’ This is denied by Hillebrandt. 6) Zeitschrift, 48, 418; Vedainterpretation, 7.

aakhyaana|आख्यान
आ-ख्यान<BR> --In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) vii. 18, 10. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 27. we hear of the Śaunaḥśepa Ākhyāna, ‘the story of Śunaḥśepa,’ which is told by the Hotṛ priest at the Rājasūya (‘royal inauguration’). The series of stories 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. xiii. 4, 3, 2. 15. used at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) during the year while the sacrificial horse is allowed to wander at its will is called the ‘cyclic’ (pari-plavam). The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 3) iii. 25, 1. mentions also Ākhyāna-vids (‘men versed in tales’), who tell the Sauparṇa legend, elswhere 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 6. 2. 7. known as a Vyākhyāna. Yāska, in the Nirukta, 5) v. 21; vii. 7. frequently uses the term, sometimes in a pregnant sense as denoting the doctrine of the Aitihāsikas or traditional interpreters of the Rigveda. 6) xi. 19; 25. Cf. Sieg. Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda. 16 et seq.

aakhyaayikaa|आख्यायिका
आ-ख्यायिका<BR> --This word occurs apparently but once in the Vedic literature, in the late Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, 1) i. 6. 3. Cf. Sieg. Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 20, n. where its significance is doubtful.

aagniveshya|आग्निवेश्य
आग्नि-वेश्य<BR> --Several teachers of this name are mentioned in the Vaṃśas or Genealogies of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. In the Mādhyandina recension 1) ii. 5, 21; iv. 5, 27. Āgniveśya is a pupil of Saitava. In the Kāṇva recension he is a pupil of Śāṇḍilya and Ānabhimlāta in one Vaṃśa, 2) ii. 6, 2. and of Gārgya in the second Vaṃśa. 3) iv. 6, 2.

aaghaaTi|आघाटि
आ-घाटि<BR> is a musical instrument, the ‘cymbal,’ used to accompany dancing. It is known to the Rigveda 1) x. 146, 2. and Atharvaveda. 2) iv. 37, 4 (āgkāṭa). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 289.

aajaatashatrava|आजातशत्रव
आजात-शत्रव<BR> See Bhadrasena.

aaji|आजि
आजि<BR> is constantly used in the Rigveda 1) v. 37, 7; vi. 24, 6, etc. and the later literature to express the sense of ‘a race,’ and only seldom denotes ‘a battle.’ Horse-racing was one of the favourite amusements of the Vedic Indian, 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 291; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 120; 2. 1 seq. the other being dicing (Akṣa). The racecourse, called Kāṣṭhā 3) Rv. viii. 80, 8; Av. ii. 14, 6. or Āji 4) Rv. iv. 24, 8; Av. xiii. 2, 4. itself, appears from the Atharvaveda 5) ii. 14, 6; xiii. 2, 4. to have been a quasi-circular one to a mark (kārṣman 6) Rv. ix. 36, 1; 74, 8. ) and back again. In the Rigveda the course is described as broad (urvī) and the distance as measured out (apāvṛktā aratnayaḥ). 7) The sense is doubtful in Rv. viii. 80, 8. Zimmer suggests that it may mean ‘the course is straight,’ without twistings, for which idea cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 160, quoting the comparison of the courser's race with a bowstring (Rv. iii. 53, 24). It is also rendered ‘the barriers are removed.’ Prizes (dhana) were offered (dhā), 8) Rv. i. 81, 3; 116, 15; vi. 45, 1 et seq.; viii. 80, 8; ix. 53, 2; 109, 10. According to Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 120, n. 2, dhana is from dhan, ‘start.’ Cf. Pischel, ibid., 171. Cf. dhanasā, Rv. i. 112, 7. 10; ii. 10, 6; viii. 3, 15, etc. and eagerly competed for. Other words for victory and the prize are kāra 9) Rv. v. 29, 8; ix. 14, 1. and bhara; 10) Rv. v. 29, 8; ix. 16, 5, etc. and to ‘run a race’ is described by the expressions ājim aj, i, dhāv, sṛ. 11) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 25; iv. 27; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 3, 4; v. 1, 1, 3; 4, 1; vi. 1, 2, 12; vii. 1, 2, 1, etc. The person who instituted a race is referred to as āji-sṛt, 12) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 5, 10. 28; xi. 1, 2, 13. and Indra is called āji-kṛt 13) Rv. viii. 53, 6. (‘race-maker’), and āji-pati 14) Ibid., 14. (‘lord of the race’). The swift steeds (vājin, atya) used for the races were often washed and adorned. 15) Rv. ii. 34, 3; ix. 109, 10; x. 68, 11. According to Pischel 16) Vedische Studien, 1, 171-173. Cf. Sieg. Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 127 et seq. the name of one swift mare is preserved--viz., Viśpalā, 17) Rv. i. 116, 15. Pischel finds here a race in honour of Vivasvant, but his equation of Khela and Vivasvant is denied even by Sieg, who accepts his theory of Viśpalā. whose broken leg was replaced by the Aśvins in a race; but the interpretation is very doubtful. Geldner 18) Vedische Studien, 2, 1 et seq. has also found a comic picture of a horse-chariot race in the Mudgala hymn in the Rigveda, but Bloomfield 19) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 541 et seq. Von Schroeder, Mysterium und Mimus im Rigveda, 346 et seq., follows Geldner. Cf. Winternitz. Vienna Oriental Journal, 23, 137. has shown that that interpretation is unsound. Pischel 20) Vedische Studien, 1, 172. also seeks to show that races were run in honour of gods, but the evidence for the theory is inadequate. 21) Sieg, op. cit., 128. A formal race, however, is a feature of the ritual of the Rājasūya or royal consecration. 22) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 15; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 9; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 19 et seq.; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 2; 3.

aaNi|आणि
आणि<BR> --This word, which is found in the Rigveda, 1) i. 35, 6; v. 43, 8. but rarely later, 2) In a Mantra in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 7. See Keith's edition, pp. 266, 267, and Vānī. appears to be best taken with Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 247. as denoting the part of the axle of the chariot which is inserted into the nave of the wheel. Sāyaṇa renders it as lynch-pin, and this sense is accepted by Leumann, 5) Etymologisches Wörterbuch, 30. being apparently also found in the Nirukta. 6) vi. 32. In one place in the Rigveda 7) i. 63, 8. Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 96. the word appears by synecdoche to denote the whole chariot, but the passage is, according to Geldner, 8) Geldner, ibid., 1, 141, n. 3. completely obscure.

aaNDiika|आण्डीक
आण्डीक<BR> (‘bearing eggs’) is a term found in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 34, 5; v. 17, 16. In the first passage the Paippalāda version has pauṇḍarīka in its place; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 207. Cf.

(though in all passages there it is used only by synecdoche of the doors of the sky), and in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 2) xxix. 5 (ātaiḥ). Cf. ātābhiḥ in Durga on Nirukta, iv. 18. Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 154. compares the Latin antae, to which the word etymologically corresponds. 4) Brugmann, Grundriss, 1, 209; 2, 214.

aati|आति
आति,<BR> an aquatic bird. The Apsarases in the legend of Purūravas and Urvaśī appear to him like Ātis, probably swans. 1) Rv. x. 95, 9. Cf. Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 1, 4. The birds appear also in the list of animals in the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’), 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 13, 1; Maītrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 18; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 34. where Mahīdhara 3) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit. renders them as the later Āḍī (Turdus ginginianus), and Sāyaṇa 4) On Taittirīya Saṃhitā, loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben; 89. quotes a view, according to which the Āti was the Cāṣa, or blue jay (Coracias indica).

aatreya|आत्रेय
आत्रेय<BR> is the patronymic of a pupil of Māṇṭi in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 (in both versions). An Ātreya appears as a Purohita of Aṅga in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 2) viii. 22. An Ātreya was regularly the priest in certain rites, 3) Ibid., vii. 7; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 3, 4, 21; Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, x. 2, 21 (sadasaḥ purastāt). and an Ātreyī occurs in an obscure passage in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 4) i. 4, 5, 13. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

aatreyiiputra|आत्रेयीपुत्र
आत्रेयी-पुत्र<BR> is mentioned as a pupil of Gautamīputra in a Vaṃśa, or Genealogy, in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 5, 2, in both versions).

aatharvaNa|आथर्वण
आथर्वण,<BR> a patronymic formed from the name of the mythic Atharvan, is found normally in the plural neuter as a designation of the hymns of the Atharvans. This use appears in the late nineteenth book of the Atharvaveda, 1) xix. 23, 1. and in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 2) xii. 9, 10. In the singular the expression Ātharvaṇa (Veda), though not occurring till the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 3) vii. 1, 2, 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. is earlier than the term ‘Atharvaveda,’ which is first found in the Sūtras. 4) Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 2, 10, etc. In the Nidāna Sūtra 5) ii. 12. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xxv.; Atharvaveda, 8 et seq. Ātharvaṇikas, or ‘followers of the Atharvaveda,’ appear.

aanuuka|आनूक
आनूक<BR> --Geldner 1) Vedische Studien, 3, 94. thinks that in its solitary occurrence in the Rigveda 2) v. 33, 9. this word means an ornament. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary. s.v. takes it adverbially, and so do Ludwig and Oldenberg.

aapayaa|आपया
आपया<BR> is the name of a river mentioned once only in the Rigveda, 1) iii. 23, 4. when it occurs between the Dṛṣadvatī and the Sarasvatī. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200. But cf. ibid., 4, 304. was inclined to identify it with the Āpagā as a name for the Ganges, but Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 18. correctly places it near the Sarasvatī, either as the small tributary which flows past Thānesar or the modern Indramatī farther west, while Pischel 4) Vedische Studien, 2, 218. assigns it to Kurukṣetra, of which the Āpayā is mentioned as a famous river in the Mahābhārata. 5) Mahābhārata, iii. 83, 68. 

aabayu|आबयु
आबयु<BR> is apparently the name of a plant in the Atharvaveda; 1) vi. 16, 1. the mustard plant 2) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 465, following the indication of the use of the hymn in the Kauśika Sūtra. may have been meant, but the sense is quite uncertain. 3) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 292; Zimmer. Altindisches Leben, 72.

aabhiprataariNa|आभिप्रतारिण
आभि-प्रतारिण<BR> --Patronymic of Vṛddhadyumna.

aabhuutitvaaShTra|आभूतित्वाष्ट्र
आ भूति त्वाष्ट्र<BR> is mentioned in two Vaṃśas, or Genealogies, of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 (in both recensions). as a pupil of Viśvarūpa Tvāṣṭra, both teachers being no doubt equally mythical.

aamalaka|आमलक
आमलक<BR> (neuter), a common word later, is found in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (vii. 3, 1), denoting the Myrobalan fruit. Cf. Amalā.

aamixaa|आमिक्षा
आमिक्षा<BR> designates a mess of clotted curds. It is not known to the Rigveda, but occurs in all the later Saṃhitās, 1) Av. x. 9, 13; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 5, 4; iii. 3, 9, 2; vi. 2, 5, 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 9; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 21; 23, etc. Brāhmaṇas, 2) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 1, 7. 9; iii. 3, 3, 2, etc.; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 8, 8; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 438 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 99, 101); Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 8, 5, etc. etc., and is associated with the Vaiśya in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka. 3) Loc. cit. Cf. Mānava Srauta Sūtra, ii. 2, 40.

aamba|आम्ब
आम्ब<BR> denotes in the Taittirīya 1) i. 8, 10, 1. and Kāṭhaka 2) xv. 5. Saṃhitās a grain, called Nāmba in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3) v. 3, 3, 8.

aambaShThya|आम्बष्ठ्य
आम्बष्ठ्य<BR> is mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 21) as a king, whose priest for the Rājasūya, or royal inauguration, was Nārada. Presumably the name is local, meaning ‘King of the Ambaṣṭhas,’ as interpreted in the St. Petersburg Dictionary. Later the term Ambaṣṭha denotes ‘a man of mingled Brāhmaṇa and Vaiśya parentage by father and mother’ respectively.

aayatana|आयतन
आ-यतन<BR> --The general sense of ‘abode’ or ‘home’ appears to be limited in one passage of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (vii. 24, 2) to the sense of ‘holy place,’ ‘sanctuary,’ which is found in the epic.

aayavasa|आयवस
आयवस<BR> is mentioned apparently as a king in a corrupt and unintelligible verse of the Rigveda. 1) i. 122, 15. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 206; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

aayu|आयु
आयु<BR> appears in the Rigveda 1) i. 53, 10; ii. 14, 7; vi. 18, 3; viii. 53, 2; Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 1, 60. with Kutsa and Atithigva as having been defeated, with Indra's aid, by Tūrvayāṇa, who is believed by Pischel 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 71-75. to have been King of the Pakthas. Possibly he is elsewhere 3) Rv. x. 49, 5; but the word is possibly not a proper name. referred to as victorious, by Indra's aid, over Veśa. Elsewhere he is quite mythical. 4) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 100, 135, 140.

aayuta|आयुत
आयुत<BR> See Ghṛta.

aayudha|आयुध
आ-युध,<BR> ‘weapon,’ in its widest sense covers the whole of a Kṣatriya's warlike equipment, which in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) vii. 19, 2. is summed up as horse-chariot (aśva-ratha), bow and arrows (iṣu-dhanva), and corselet (kavaca). As the bow and arrow (iṣu, dhanvan) were essential as the main weapons of the Vedic fighter, they are probably meant when Āyudha is used specifically of weapons, as often from the Rigveda 2) i. 39, 2; 61. 13; 92, 1; ii. 30, 9. etc.; Av. vi. 133, 2, etc. onwards. The battle hymn in the Rigveda 3) vi. 75. confirms this view, as it presents to us the warrior armed with bow and arrow on his chariot, and clad in armour (Varman), with a guard (Hastaghna) on the left arm to avoid the friction of the bow-string. The corselet was not a single solid piece of metal, but consisted of many pieces fitted together (syūta); 4) Rv. i. 31, 15. it may have been made either of metal plates or, as is more likely, of some stiff material plated with metal. In addition the warrior wore a helmet (Śiprā). There is no trace of the use of a shield, nor is there any clear record of the employment of greaves or other guard for the feet. 5) Grassmann saw greaves in vaṭūriṇā padā in Rv. i. 133, 2, but this is most improbable. Skill in the use of weapons is referred to in the Rigveda. 6) i. 92, 1. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 183; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 295. It is doubtful whether sling stones (Adri, Aśani) were in ordinary use. The hook (aṅkuśa) 7) Rv. viii. 17, 10; x. 44, 9; 134, 6; Av. vi. 83, 3. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts. 5, 87. also is merely a divine weapon, and the axe (svadhiti, 8) Rv. v. 32, 10; ix. 67, 30; x. 43, 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 298301; Muir, Sanskrit Texts. 5, 469-472; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 281 et seq. vāśī, paraśu) does not occur in mortal combats. For the use of the spear see Ṛṣṭi, Rambhiṇī, Śakti, Śaru; of the sword, Asi, Kṛti. Neither weapon can be considered ordinary in warfare, nor was the club (Vajra) used. For the modes of warfare see Saṃgrāma.

aayogava|आयोगव
आयोगव।--मरुत्त आवि-क्षित,<BR> the Āyogava king, is mentioned as a sacrificer in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) xiii. 5. 4, 6. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xvi. 9, 14-16. where also a Gāthā (‘stanza’) celebrating his sacrifice is cited. Cf. Ayogū.

aarangara|आरङ्गर
आरङ्गर<BR> is one of the names of the bee found in the Rigveda. 1) x. 106, 10. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 97. Other names are Sarah and Bhṛṅgā.

aaraa|आरा
आरा,<BR> a word later 1) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 365. n. 1. known as an ‘awl’ or ‘gimlet,’ occurs in the Rigveda 2) vi. 53. 8. only to designate a weapon of Pūṣan, with whose pastoral character its later use for piercing leather is consistent. Cf. Vāśī.

aaraaDhi|आराढि
आराढि<BR> --Patronymic of Saujāta. Cf. Arāḍa. 

aaruNaaupaveshi|आरुणऔपवेशि
आरुण औप-वेशि<BR> --So the manuscripts let us read the former word in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, but this is doubtless an error for Aruṇa.

aaruNi|आरुणि
आरुणि<BR> is the patronymic normally referring to Uddālaka, son of Aruṇa Aupaveśi. Uddālaka is probably also meant by Āruṇi Yaśasvin, who occurs as a teacher of the Subrahmaṇyā (a kind of recitation) in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa. 1) ii. 80. Āruṇis are referred to both in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 2) ii. 5, 1. Cf. Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 204. and in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 3) xiii. 12. as well as in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka. 4) ii. 4. 1.

aaruNeya|आरुणेय
आरुणेय<BR> --An epithet of Śvetaketu, indicating his descent from Uddālaka Āruṇi and Aruṇa Aupaveśi. It is apparently confined to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) x. 3, 4, 1; xi. 2, 7, 12; 5, 4, 18; 6, 2, 1; xii. 2, 1, 9; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 2, 1. and Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 2) v. 3, 1; vi. 1, 1. in which Śvetaketu plays a great part.

aarxa|आर्क्ष
आर्क्ष<BR> --Patronymic of Śrutarvan and of Āśvamedha.

aarjiika|आर्जीक
आर्जीक<BR> 1) Singular: Rv. viii. 7, 29; ix. 113, 2. Plural: ix. 65, 23. and Ārjīkīya 2) Rv. viii. 64, 11. (masc.), Ārjīkīyā 3) Rv. x. 75, 5. (fem.).--The two masculine forms probably denote the people or land, while the feminine word designates the river of the land. Hillebrandt 4) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 126-137. locates the country in or near Kaśmir, as Arrian 5) Anabasis, v. 29, 4. mentions Arsaces, brother of Abhisares, who presumably took his name from his people, and Abhisāra bordered on Kaśmir. Pischel 6) Vedische Studien, 2, 209, 217. accepts Ārjīka as designating a country, which he, however, thinks cannot be identified. But neither Roth 7) St. Petersburg Dictionary. nor Zimmer 8) Altindisches Leben. 12-14. recognizes the word as a proper name. On the other hand, all authorities agree in regarding Ārjīkīyā as the name of a river. Roth 9) Op. cit., s.v. suṣomā. does so in one passage 10) Rv. x. 75, 5. only, elsewhere seeing references to Soma vessels; but it seems necessary to treat the word alike in all passages containing it. Zimmer does not locate the river, and Pischel denies the possibility of its identification. Hillebrandt thinks it may have been the Upper Indus, or the Vitastā (the Jhelum), or some other stream. Grassmann follows Yāska 11) Nirukta, ix. 26. in identifying it with the the Vipāś (Beäs), but this is rendered improbable by the position of the name in the hymn in praise of rivers (nadīstuti). 12) Rv. x. 75. Brunnhofer 13) Iran und Turan, 52. Cf. Max Mūller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 398; 399. identifies it with the Arghesan, a tributary of the Arghanab.

aarjuneya|आर्जुनेय
आर्जुनेय<BR> --In the Rigveda 1) i. 112, 23; iv. 26, 1; vii. 19, 2; viii. 1, 11. this name occurs as the patronymic of Kautsa.

aartabhaagiiputra|आर्तभागीपुत्र
आर्तभागी-पुत्र<BR> is mentioned as a pupil of Śauṅgī-putra in a Vaṃśa or Genealogy in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) vi. 5, 2 (also in the Mādhyandina version). Ārtabhāga is a patronymic of Jaratkārava in the same Upaniṣad. 2) iii. 2, 1, 13.

aartava|आर्तव
आर्तव<BR> --This expression denotes a portion of the year consisting of more seasons than one. But it does not bear the exact sense of ‘half-year,’ as suggested by Zimmer. 1) Altindisches Leben. 374. This is shown by the fact that it occurs regularly in the plural, not in the dual. In the Atharvaveda it occurs between seasons and years (hāyana), 2) iii. 10, 9. but also in the combinations, ‘seasons, Ārtavas, months, years,; 3) iii. 10, 10. ‘half-months, months, Ārtavas, seasons’; 4) xi. 7, 20. Cf. xv. 6, 6; 17, 6. ‘seasons, Ārtavas, months, half-months, days and nights, day’; 5) xvi. 8, 18. and in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā ‘months, seasons, Ārtavas, the year,’ 6) xxii. 28. or simply with the seasons. 7) Av. v. 28, 2. 13; x. 6, 18; 7, 5; xi. 3, 17; 6, 17; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 2, 6, 1, 3. Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, i, 3. cited in this sense in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, is not so to be understood, as the word there is merely adjectival.

aartnii|आर्त्नी
आर्त्नी<BR> denotes the end of the bow to which the bow-string (jyā) was attached. 1) Rv. vi. 75, 4; Av. i. 1, 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 11; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 9, etc. The string was not normally kept fastened to both ends of the bow, but when an arrow was to be shot it was strung taut. 2) Rv. x. 166, 3. Cf. Av. vi. 42, 1. On the other hand, the legend of the death of Viṣṇu, told in the later Saṃhitās 3) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 5. 9. and Brāhmaṇas, 4) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vii. 5. 6; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1, 1, 7 et seq. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 297, 298; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 270. expressly contemplates his leaning on his strung bow, which cleaves his head by the sudden springing apart of the two ends when the bow-string is gnawed through.

aarya|आर्य
आर्य<BR> is the normal designation in the Vedic literature from the Rigveda 1) Rv. i. 51, 8; 130, 8; 156, 5, etc. onwards of an Āryan, a member of the three upper classes, Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, or Vaiśya, as the formal division is given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 2) iv. 1, 6 (Kāṇva recension). The Ārya stands in opposition to the Dāsa, 3) Rv. i. 51, 8. 9; 103, 3; vi. 20, 10; 25, 2, 3, etc. (opposed to Dāsa); Av. iv. 20, 4. 8; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 6, 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 30, etc. (opposed to Sūdra). but also to the Śūdra. Sometimes 4) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 205, 215, finds this use--understanding Ārya as meant--in Atharvaveda, xix. 32, 8, and 62, 1, as well as in passages where Śūdrāryau is found. Lanman, in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 948, 1003, quotes his view with approval; but Whitney's version leaves no doubt that he read and understood the text as Ārya, the Āryan, not the Vaiśya. For Whitney's view, Av. iv. 20, 4. 8 may be cited; and so Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., takes the passages. In Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 10, 8, Śūdrāryau must mean Sūdra and Vaiśya; but the Padapāṭha takes it as Arya, and so does Zimmer. the expression is restricted to the Vaiśya caste, the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya receiving special designations; but this use is not common, and it is often uncertain also whether Arya is not meant. The phrase Śūdrāryau 5) See Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 9, 3, with Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 3, 7. 8; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 5; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 17; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 6, 7; Lāṭyāyana Sūtra, iv. 2, 5; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvii. 6, 2; Anupada Sūtra, vii. 10. is especially ambiguous, but appears to have denoted originally the Śūdra and the Āryan, for in the Mahāvrata ceremony the fight between a Śūdra and an Ārya is represented in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa as one between a Brāhmaṇa and a Śūdra, though the Sūtra treats it as a fight between a Vaiśya and a Śūdra. The word Ārya (fem. Āryā or Ārī) also occurs frequently used as an adjective to describe the Āryan classes (viśaḥ), 6) Rv. i. 77, 3; 96, 31; x. 11, 4; 43, 4, etc. or name (nāman), 7) Rv. x; 49, 3. or caste (varṇa), 8) Rv. iii. 34, 9. Cf. Varṇa. or dwellings (dhāman); 9) Rv. ix. 63, 14. or again reference is made to the Āryan supremacy (vrata) 10) Rv. x. 65, 11. So Agni and Indra are styled Āryan, as supporters of the Āryan people (Rv. vi. 60, 6). being extended over the land. Āryan foes (vṛtra) 11) Rv. vi. 33, 3; vii. 83, 1; x. 69, 6. are referred to beside Dāsa foes, and there are many 12) Rv. i. 102, 5; iii. 32, 14; vi. 22, 10; 25, 2. 3; viii. 2, 4. 27; x. 38, 3; 83, 1; 102, 3, etc. references to war of Āryan versus Āryan, as well as to war of Āryan against Dāsa. From this it can be fairly deduced that even by the time of the Rigveda the Āryan communities had advanced far beyond the stage of simple conquest of the aborigines. In the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas the wars alluded to seem mainly Āryan wars, no doubt in consequence of the fusion of Ārya and Dāsa into one community. Weber 13) Indische Studien, 17, 288. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. kṛṣṭi, and Pañca Janāsaḥ. considers that the five peoples known to the Rigveda were the Āryans and the four peoples of the quarters (diś) of the earth, but this is doubtful. Āryan speech (vāc) 14) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 2, 5; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, viii. 9. Cf. Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 196, 255; and Vāc. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 207 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 214 et seq. is specially referred to in the Aitareya and Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyakas. 

aarya|आर्य
आर्य<BR> See Mālya.

arShTiSheNa|अर्ष्टिषेण
अर्ष्टि-षेण<BR> --Patronymic of Devāpi. 1) Rv. x. 98, 5. 6. 8; Nirukta, ii. 11; Bṛhaddevatā, vii. 155.

aala|आल
आल<BR> appears to mean ‘weed’ in the Atharvaveda, 1) Av. vi. 16, 3. But Whitney takes the word as a verb, comparing v. 22, 6. and to form part of three other words, 2) Av. vi. 16, 4. denoting, according to Sāyaṇa, grass-creepers (sasya-vallī)--viz., Alasālā, Silañjālā, 3) Sāyaṇa reads Śalāñjālā, and the manuscripts of the Kauśika Sūtra (vi. 16), have Śilāñjālā. But cf. Silācī. and Nīlāgalasāla. Whitney, 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 292, 293. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 466. however, does not think that the words can be given any determinate sense.

aalambaayaniiputra|आलम्बायनीपुत्र
आलम्बायनी-पुत्र<BR> is mentioned in a Vaṃśa or Genealogy of the Kāṇva recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 5, 2) as a pupil of Ālambī-putra. In the Mādhyandina recension (vi. 4, 32) the relation is reversed, for there he is teacher of Ālambī-putra and pupil of Jāyantī-putra.

aalambiiputra|आलम्बीपुत्र
आलम्बी-पुत्र<BR> is a pupil of Jāyantī-putra according to a Vaṃśa in the Kāṇva recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 5, 2), but of Ālambāyanī-putra according to the Mādhyandina (vi. 4, 32).

aaligii|आलिगी
आलिगी<BR> is the name of a kind of serpent in the Atharvaveda (v. 13, 7). Cf. Viligī.

aavasatha|आवसथ
आ-वसथ<BR> (‘dwelling’).--The precise sense 1) Av. ix. 6, 5 (a hymn in praise of entertaining Brāhmaṇas); Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 10, 6; iii. 7, 4, 6; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 4, 4, 6 (where Eggeling renders the word as if meaning ‘house’ merely); Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 1, 1, etc. Details are given in the Sūtras--e.g., Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, v. 9, 3; Dharma Sūtra, ii. 9, 25, 4. of this term appears to be a place for the reception of guests, especially Brāhmaṇas and others on the occasion of feasts and sacrifices (somewhat like the modern meaning of Dharma-śālā as a resthouse for pilgrims), a use derived from the more general sense of ‘abode.’ 2) E.g., Aitareya Upaniṣad, iii. 12. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 120, n. 1. 

aavika|आविक
आविक<BR> (‘coming from the sheep,’ avi) is a term for ‘wool,’ which occurs first in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (ii. 3, 6). Cf. Avi.

avixita|अविक्षित
अवि-क्षित<BR> --Patronymic of Marutta, 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 21; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 6. the Āyogava.

aashariika|आशरीक
आ-शरीक<BR> appears to denote a disease in a hymn of the Atharvaveda 1) xix. 34, 10. celebrating the powers of the Jaṅgida plant. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 65, 391. thinks that it merely denotes the pain in the limbs accompanying fever. Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 953. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 673. suggests taking the word as merely an epithet.

aashir|आशिर्
आ-शिर्<BR> (‘admixture’) denotes the mixing, and more especially the milk mixed with the juice, of the Soma before it was offered to the gods. In this sense it is not rare from the Rigveda 1) i. 134, 6; iii. 53, 14; viii. 2, 10. 11, etc.; Av. ii. 29, 1, etc.; Nirukta, vi. 8; 32. onwards. Not milk alone was employed for this purpose. The epithet ‘having three admixtures’ applied to Soma 2) Rv. v. 27, 5; cf. viii. 2, 7. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 209 et seq. is explained by the other epithets, ‘mixed with milk’ (gavāśir), ‘mixed with curds’ (dadhy-āśir), and ‘mixed with grain’ (yavāśir)--all referring to Soma.

aashiiviSha|आशीविष
आशी-विष,<BR> occurring only in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 1) vi. 1. is understood by Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. It is a common word in the Epic and later. as designating a particular kind of snake, and perhaps means ‘having poison (viṣa) in its fangs’ (āśī).

aashu|आशु
आशु,<BR> the ‘swift,’ is frequently used without Aśva to denote the chariot steed from the Rigveda 1) ii. 16, 3; 31, 2; 38, 3, etc.; Av. ii. 14, 6; iv. 27, 1; xiii. 2, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 10; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 3, 3, etc. onwards. 

aashuMga|आशुंग
आशुं-ग<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 14, 3. seems to denote some sort of animal. It is qualified by the word ‘young’ (śiśuka), and Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. suggests that it may mean a bird (‘swift-flying’), or that the expression denotes ‘a foal going to its dam’ (āśu-ga). Sāyaṇa, however, reads the accompanying word as śuśuka, which he assumes to denote an animal. Bloomfield 3) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 464. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 291. renders the two words ‘a swift (āśuṃga) foal (śiśuka),’ thus agreeing with one of Roth's suggestions in sense, though not in the explanation of Aśuṃga.

aashrama|आश्रम
आ-श्रम<BR> (‘resting-place’) does not occur in any Upaniṣad which can be regarded as pre-Buddhistic. Its earliest use as denoting the stages of a Hindu's life is found in the Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad. 1) Atyāśramin, Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad, vi. 21; Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad, iv. 3, etc. In one passage 2) viii. 5. of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad reference is made only to the Brahmacārin and householder, to whom, as a reward for study, the procreation of children, the practice of Yoga, abstention from injury to living creatures, and sacrifices, freedom from transmigration are promised. In another place 3) ii. 23, 1. three states are contemplated, but not as consecutive. The Brahmacārin may either become a householder or become an anchorite, or remain in his teacher's house all his life. Similarly, reference 4) v. 10. is made to the death of the anchorite in the forest, or the sacrifice in the village. In contrast with all three 5) ii. 23, 1. is the man who stands fast in Brahman (Brahmasaṃstha). In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6) iv. 2, 22. Cf. iii. 5. the knower of the Ātman is contrasted with those who (1) study, or (2) sacrifice and give alms, or (3) are anchorites, and in another place 7) iii. 8, 10. with those who sacrifice and make benefactions, and those who practice asceticism. This position of superiority to, and distinction from, the Āśramas became later a fourth 8) Jābāla Upaniṣad, 4. Cf. Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad, ii. 1, 7. Āśrama, the Gṛhastha, or householder, who was in the second stage, being required to pass not only into the stage of Vānaprastha, but also that of the Sannyāsin (Bhikṣu, Parivrājaka). The first stage, that of the Brahmacārin, was still obligatory, but was no longer allowed to remain a permanent one, as was originally possible. Cf. Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 60, 367 et seq.

aashreShaa|आश्रेषा
आ-श्रेषा, आ-श्लेषा<BR> See Nakṣatra.

aashvaghna|आश्वघ्न
आश्व-घ्न<BR> --This name occurs in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 61, 21. in a very obscure hymn, where it appears to denote a prince who had made offerings to Indra, and who may, as Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165. thinks, have been called Vitaraṇa.

ashvataraaashvi|अश्वतरआश्वि
अश्वतर आश्वि,<BR> or Āśvatarāśvi.--These two expressions are used 1) The first is found in Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 30; the second in Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 6, 1, 9; x. 6, 1, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 15, 8; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 11, 1; 16, 1. as patronymics of Buḍila, denoting, according to Sāyaṇa, 2) On Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. that he was son of Aśva, and descendant of Aśvatara.

ashvatthya|अश्वत्थ्य
अश्व-त्थ्य<BR> --Patronymic of Ahīnā. 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 9, 10. Possibly to be read Āśvathya.

ashvamedha|अश्वमेध
अश्व-मेध<BR> is the patronymic of an unnamed prince, who occurs in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda (viii. 68, 15. 16).

aashvavaala|आश्ववाल
आश्व-वाल<BR> --From this adjective (‘made of horse-tail grass’), applied to a strew (prastara) in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (iii. 4, 1, 17; 6, 3, 10), follows the existence of the Aśvavāla grass (Saccharum spontaneum).

aashvasuukti|आश्वसूक्ति
आश्व-सूक्ति<BR> is mentioned in Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xix. 4, 2, et seq.) as an author of Sāmans (Soma chants) along with Gausūkti. 

aashvina|आश्विन
आश्विन,<BR> or Āśvīna, designates, in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 131, 3. and two Brāhmaṇas, 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 17; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa in Indische Studien, 1, 34. the length of journey made in a day by a horseman (aśvin). The exact distance is not defined. In the Atharva it appears to exceed five leagues, being mentioned immediately after a distance of three or five Yojanas; in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa the heavenly world is placed at a distance of a thousand Āśvinas.

aaShaadhisaushromateya|आषाधिसौश्रोमतेय
आषाधि सौश्रोमतेय<BR> --According to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) vi. 2, 1, 37. Eggeling has Aṣāḍhi, but as it is a patronymic of Aṣāḍha, the form Āṣāḍhi seems correct. he was ruined because the heads were put on at the Agniciti in a certain manner, and not correctly.

aaShTraa|आष्ट्रा
आष्ट्रा<BR> seems in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (xxxvii. 1) to denote the ploughman's goad.

aaShTrii|आष्ट्री
आष्ट्री<BR> --In the Rigveda 1) x. 165, 3. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 347. the word seems to denote a fireplace. The evil bird is entreated not to settle there on the hearth.

aasangaplaayogi|आसङ्गप्लायोगि
आसङ्ग प्लायोगि<BR> is a king who appears in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda 1) viii. 1, 32. 33. as a generous patron. Owing, however, to the addition of a curious phallic verse to the hymn, and its early misunderstanding, 2) viii. 1, 34. See Hopkins, Religions of India, 150, n. 1; Bṛhaddevatā, ii. 83; vi. 41, with Macdonell's notes. Dyādvi. eda gives the tale at length in Vedic words taken from the Nighaṇṭu, a curious jeu d'esprit. See the extract from the Nītimañjarī given by Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 40, 41. a legend was invented that he lost his manhood and became a woman, but by the intercession of Medhyātithi was transformed into a man, much to the delight of his wife, Śaśvatī, whose existence is based on a misunderstanding of the phrase ‘every woman’ (śaśvatī nārī) in the added verse. 3) viii. 1, 34. Another misunderstanding of the Dānastuti 4) viii. 1, 31. 32. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 89; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 106, 107; Oldenberg. Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 354. gives him a son Svanad-ratha, really a mere epithet, and makes him a descendant of Yadu.

aasandii|आसन्दी
आ-सन्दी<BR> --This is a generic term for a seat of some sort, occurring frequently in the later Saṃhitās 1) Av. xiv. 2, 65; xv. 3, 2 et seq.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 8, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, viii. 56; xix. 16; 86, etc. and Brāhmaṇas. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5; 6; 12; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 4, 26; v. 2, 1, 22; 4, 4, 1, etc. but not in the Rigveda. In the Atharvaveda 3) xv. 3, 2 et seq. the settle brought for the Vrātya is described at length. It had two feet, lengths wise and cross-pieces, forward and cross-cords, showing that it was made of wood and also cording. It was also covered with a cushion (Āstaraṇa) and a pillow (Upabarhaṇa), had a seat (Āsāda) and a support (Upaśraya). Similar seats are described in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 4) i. 5. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 397; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Aranyaka, 19. and the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa. 5) ii. 24. The seat for the king at the royal consecration is described in very similar terms in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 6) viii. 5; 6; 12. where the height of the feet is placed at a span, and the lengthwise and cross-pieces are each to be a cubit, while the interwoven part (vivayana) is to be of Muñja grass, and the seat of Udumbara wood. In another passage of the Atharvaveda 7) xiv. 2, 65. See his note in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 765. Lanman seems to take the seat meant as a ‘long reclining chair.’ There also a cushion (Upadhāna) and coverlet (Upavāsana) are mentioned. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa repeatedly describes the Āsandī in terms showing that it was an elaborate seat. In one place 8) v. 4, 4, 1. it is said to be made of Khadira wood, perforated (vi-tṛṇṇā), and joined with straps (vardhra-yutā) like that of the Bhāratas. At the Sautrāmaṇī rite 9) xii. 8, 3, 4 et seq. (an Indra sacrifice) the seat is of Udumbara wood, is knee-high, and of unlimited width and depth, and is covered with plaited reed-work. The imperial seat 10) xiv. 1, 3, 8 et seq. is to be shoulder-high, of Udumbara wood, and wound all over with cords of Balvaja grass (Eleusina indica). Elsewhere 11) vi. 7, 1, 12 et seq. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 155. the seat is a span high, a cubit in width and depth, of Udumbara wood, and covered with reed-grass cords, and daubed with clay.

aasandiivant|aasandiivat|आसन्दीवत्|आसन्दीवन्त्
आसन्दी-वन्त्,<BR> ‘possessing the throne,’ is the title of the royal city of Janamejaya Pārikṣita, in which the horse, for his famous Aśvamedha, was bound. The authorities both cite a Gāthā for the fact, but they differ as to the priest who celebrated the rite. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 5, 4, 2. he is stated to have been Indrota Daivāpa Śaunaka, but in the Aitareya 2) viii. 21. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 9, 1. Pāṇini, viii. 2, 12, knows the name. Tura Kāvaṣeya.

aasaada|आसाद
आ-साद,<BR> ‘seat,’ occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) xv. 3, 8. as a description of part of the settle (Āsandī) of the Vrātya. It seems best to regard it with Whitney 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 771. as the seat proper; Aufrecht, 3) Indische Studien, 1, 131. Zimmer, 4) Altindisches Leben, 155. and Roth 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. render it as the ‘cushion for the seat,’ but that is sufficiently described by the word Āstaraṇa.

aasuraayaNa|आसुरायण
आसुरायण<BR> is mentioned as a pupil of Traivaṇi in the first two Vaṃśas 1) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3. (lists of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad in both recensions, but as a pupil of Āsuri in the third Vaṃśa. 2) vi. 5, 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 434, n.

aasuri|आसुरि
आसुरि<BR> occurs in the first two Vaṃśas 1) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3. (lists of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad as a pupil of Bhāradvāja and teacher of Aupajandhani, but in the third 2) vi. 5, 2. as a pupil of Yājñavalkya and teacher of Āsurāyaṇa. He appears as a ritual authority in the first four books of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 3) i. 6, 3, 26; ii. 1, 4, 27; 3, 1, 9; 4, 1, 2; 6, 1, 25. 33; 3, 17; iv. 5, 8, 14. and as an authority on dogmatic, specially noted for his insistence on truth, in the last book. 4) xiv. 1, 1, 33, and notes 1, 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 430 et seq., whose suggestion of the identity of this teacher and the founder of the Sāṃkhya system is not, however, acceptable. See Garbe, Sāṃkhya Philosophie, 29, 30.

aasurivaasin|आसुरिवासिन्
आसुरि-वासिन्<BR> is a name of Prāśnī-putra in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 5, 2, in both recensions).

aasechana|आसेचन
आ-सेचन<BR> designates a vessel to hold liquids, such as meat juice (yūṣan) 1) Rv. i. 162, 13. or ghee. 2) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 9, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 271. Of its shape and make we know nothing.

aastaraNa|आस्तरण
आ-स्तरण<BR> denotes the coverlet of the settle (Āsandī) of the Vrātya. 1) Av. xv. 3, 7. A tiger's skin serves as the coverlet of the king's seat in the royal consecration (Rājasūya). 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5. In the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 3) i. 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 155. the word used is Upastaraṇa.

aastrabudhna|आस्त्रबुध्न
आस्त्र-बुध्न<BR> is the name of a man whom Indra is said in the Rigveda 1) x. 171, 3. to have assisted. It is not clear whether Venya, who is mentioned in the same line, was his friend 2) So Grassmann and Griffith in their translations. or his enemy, 3) So Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 167. whom Indra saved or defeated for him.

aasthaatR|आस्थातृ
आ-स्थातृ<BR> --The warrior in the chariot is once thus designated (as ‘standing on the car’) in the Rigveda. 1) vi. 47, 26. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 296. Normally he is named Rathin or Ratheṣṭhā. 

aasraava|आस्राव
आ-स्राव<BR> (‘discharge’) denotes a disease, thrice referred to in the Atharvaveda, 1) i. 2, 4; ii. 3, 2; vi. 44, 2. the precise nature of which is uncertain. The Scholiast 2) On Av. i. 2, 4. Cf. on ii. 3, 2. in one place interprets it as painful urination (mūtrātisāra), while Lanman 3) In Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 3. suggests diabetes. Bloomfield 4) American Journal of Philology, 7, 467; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, cxiii; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 233, 234. takes it to be diarrhœa, and Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 392. argues that as the remedy is called ‘wound healer’ (arus-srāṇa), the sense is ‘the flux from unhealed wounds.’ Whitney 6) Op. cit., 3, 41. renders it ‘flux,’ and questions Bloomfield's rendering. Ludwig 7) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 507, 509. translates it vaguely by ‘sickness’ and ‘cold.’

aahanasyaa|आहनस्या
आहनस्या<BR> (‘unchaste’).--This word in the plural (‘lascivious verses’) denotes a section (xx. 136) of the Kuntāpa hymns of the Atharvaveda, which are of an obscene character. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 36; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxx. 7. Cf. Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 99.

aahaava|आहाव
आ-हाव<BR> denotes a pail or bucket, especially in conjunction with a well (Avata). 1) Rv. i. 34, 8; vi. 7, 2; x. 101, 5; 112, 6; Nirukta, v. 26.

aahneya|आह्नेय
आह्नेय<BR> --Patronymic of Sauca (Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 12). I.

ixu|इक्षु
इक्षु,<BR> the generic name for the sugar-cane, is first found in the Atharvaveda 1) i. 34, 5. and the later Saṃhitās. 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 7, 9; iv. 2, 9 (ikṣu-kāṇḍa). In Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxv. 1; Taittirīya Saṃhiṭā, vii. 3, 16, 1; Kāṭhaka Aśvamedha, in. 8, ‘eyelash’ is meant. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Whether it grew wild, or was cultivated, does not appear from the references. 

ixvaaku|इक्ष्वाकु
इक्ष्वाकु<BR> --In the Rigveda this name occurs but once, 1) x. 60, 4. and in a doubtful context. It is clear, however, that it denotes a prince; later interpretations make Asamāti, whose name is read into the hymn, an Ikṣvāku prince. 2) Cf. Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 167; Sāṭyāyanaka in Max Müller, Rigveda, 4, c-cvii, 167; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 42; Bṛhaddevatā, vii. 85 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. In the Atharvaveda 3) xiv. 39, 9. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 680; Whitney Translation of the Atharvaveda, 961. also the name is found in only one passage, where it is uncertain whether a descendant of Ikṣvāku, or Ikṣvāku himself, is referred to; in either case he seems to be regarded as an ancient hero. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 4) xiii. 3, 12. mention is made of Tryaruṇa Traidhātva Aikṣvāka, who is identical with the Tryaruṇa Traivṛṣṇa of the Bṛhaddevatā, 5) v. 14 et seq. and with Tryaruṇa Trasadasyu in the Rigveda. 6) v. 27, 3. Cf. Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 68-75; Macdonell, Bṛhaddevatā, 2, 170; Oldenberg, Vedic Hymns, 366 et seq.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 133, 138; 4, 324. The connection of Trasadasyu with the Ikṣvākus is confirmed by the fact that Purukutsa was an Aikṣvāka, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 7) xiii. 5, 4, 5. Thus the Ikṣvāku line was originally a line of princes of the Pūrus. Zimmer 8) Altindisches Leben, 104, 130. places them on the upper Indus, but they may well have been somewhat further east. 9) Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 218; Geldner, ibid., 3, 152. Later Ikṣvāku is connected with Ayodhyā

iTa|इट
1. Iṭa.<BR> --This word occurs twice in the Atharvaveda. in the first passage 1) vi. 14, 3. Cf. iv. 19, 1; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 464. it seems to denote a bulrush of the sort that dies in a year; in the second 2) ix. 3, 18. Cf. Pischel, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft, 35, 718. it refers to the reed work of the house.

iTa|इट
2. Iṭa appears as a Ṛṣi and a protégé of Indra in one hymn of the Rigveda. 1) x. 171, 1. Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. however, thinks that the word is really part of a verb (iṭ) meaning ‘to err, wander’ (cp. aṭ), and that the name is a mere misunderstanding. It is already so regarded in the Anukramaṇī, but not apparently in the Bṛhaddevatā. 3) viii. 73. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 133.

iTantkaavya|इटन्त्काव्य
इटन्त् काव्य<BR> is the name of a sage, contemporary with Keśin Dārbhya, in the Kauṣitaki Brāhmaṇa. 1) vii. 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 293; 2, 308. He is also mentioned as Iḍhant in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 2) xiv. 9, 16.

itihaasa|इतिहास
इतिहास,<BR> as a kind of literature, is repeatedly mentioned along with Purāṇa in the later texts of the Vedic period. The earliest reference to both occurs in the late fifteenth book of the Atharvaveda. 1) xv. 6, 4 et seq. Itihāsa then appears in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 2) xiii. 4, 3, 12. 13, and as compounded in xi. 5, 6, 8; 7, 9. the Jaiminīya, 3) i. 53. Bṛhadāraṇyaka, 4) ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 2; v. 11. and Chāndogya Upaniṣads. 5) iii. 4, 1. 2; vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. In the latter it is expressly declared with Purāṇa to make up the fifth Veda, while the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 6) xvi. 2, 21. 27. makes the Itihāsa a Veda and the Purāṇa a Veda. The Itihāsa-veda and the Purāṇa-veda appear also in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, 7) i. 10. while the Śatapatha 8) xiii. 4, 3, 12. 13. identifies the Itihāsa as well as the Purāṇa with the Veda. In one passage Anvākhyāna and Itihāsa are distinguished 9) xi. 1, 6, 9. Cf. p. 24. as different classes of works, but the exact point of distinction is obscure; probably the former was supplementary. The Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 10) ii. 9. mentions Itihāsas and Purāṇas in the plural. There is nothing to show in the older literature what distinction there was, if any, between Itihāsa and Purāṇa; and the late literature, 11) See Sāyaṇa's Introduction to the Rigveda, p. 12 (ed. Max Müller), and his commentary on Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 6, 8; Śaṃkara on Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 4, 10. which has been elaborately examined by Sieg, 12) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 31 et seq. yields no consistent result. Geldner 13) Vedische Studien, 1, 290. Cf. Sieg, op. cit., 33. has conjectured that there existed a single work, the Itihāsa-purāṇa, a collection of the old legends of all sorts, heroic, cosmogonic, genealogical; but though a work called Itihāsa, and another called Purāṇa, were probably known to Patañjali, 14) Vārttika on Pāṇini, iv. 2, 60, and Mahābhāṣya (ed. Kielhorn), 2, 284. the inaccuracy of Geldner's view is proved by the fact that Yāska shows no sign of having known any such work. To him the Itihāsa may be a part of the Mantra literature itself, 15) Nirukta, iv. 6. Aitihāsikas being merely people who interpret the Rigveda by seeing in it legends where others see myths. 16) Ibid., ii. 16; xii. 1. The fact, however, that the use of the compound form is rare, and that Yāska regularly has Itihāsa, 17) Ibid., ii. 10; 24; iv. 6; x. 26; xii. 10. not Itihāsa-purāṇa, is against the theory of there ever having been one work. The relation of Itihāsa to Ākhyāna is also uncertain. Sieg 18) Op. cit., 31 et seq. considers that the words Itihāsa and Purāṇa referred to the great body of mythology, legendary history, and cosmogonic legend available to the Vedic poets, and roughly classed as a fifth Veda, though not definitely and finally fixed. Thus, Anvākhyānas, Anuvyākhyānas, and Vyākhyānas could arise, and separate Ākhyānas could still exist outside the cycle, while an Ākhyāna could also be a part of the Itihāsa-purāṇa. He also suggests that the word Ākhyāna has special reference to the form of the narrative. Oldenberg, 19) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 37, 54 et seq.; 39, 52 et seq. Cf. also Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1908, 67 et seq. following Windisch, 20) Verhandlungen der dreiunddreissigsten Versammlung deutcher Philologen und Sckulmänner in Gera (1879), 15 et seq. and followed by Geldner, 21) Vedische Studien, 1, 284; 2, 1 et seq. Sieg, and others, has found in the Ākhyāna form a mixture of prose and verse, alternating as the narrative was concerned with the mere accessory parts of the tale, or with the chief points, at which the poetic form was naturally produced to correspond with the stress of the emotion. This theory has been severely criticized by Hertel 22) Vienna Oriental Journal, 18, 59 et seq.; 23, 273 et seq. Cf. Winternitz, ibid., 23, 102 et seq. and von Schroeder. 23) Mystcrium und Mimus im Rigveda, 3 et seq. These scholars, in accordance with older suggestions of Max Müller 24) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 183. and Lévi, 25) Le Théātre indien, 303, 307. see in the so-called Ākhyāna hymns of the Rigveda, in which Oldenberg finds actual specimens of the supposed literary genus, though the prose has been lost, actual remains of ritual dramas. Elsewhere 26) Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 200 et seq. it has been suggested that the hymns in question are merely literary dialogues.

id|इद्
इद्-, इदा-, इदुवत्सर<BR> See Saṃvatsara.

indragopa|इन्द्रगोप
इन्द्र-गोप<BR> (‘protected by Indra’), masc., is a designation of the cochineal insect in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (ii. 3, 6).

indradyumnabhaallaveyavaiyaaghrapadya|इन्द्रद्युम्नभाल्लवेयवैयाघ्रपद्य
इन्द्र-द्युम्न भाल्लवेय वैयाघ्र-पद्य<BR> is mentioned as a teacher who with others was unable to agree as to the nature of Agni Vaiśvānara, and who was instructed by Aśvapati Kaikeya. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 6, 1, 1 et seq.; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 11, 1 et seq. As Bhāllaveya he is cited several times in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) i. 6, 1, 19; xiii. 5, 3, 4. Cf. ii. 1, 4. 6. on ritual points.

indrabhuukaashyapa|इन्द्रभूकाश्यप
इन्द्र-भू काश्यप<BR> is mentioned as a pupil of Mitrabhū Kāśyapa in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 374.

indrota|इन्द्रोत
1. Indrota is twice mentioned in the Rigveda 1) viii. 68, 10 et seq. in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Liberality’) as a giver of gifts. In the second passage he has the epithet Ātithigva, which shows conclusively that he was a son of Atithigva, as Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. holds, and not of Ṛkṣa, as Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. states.

indrotadaivaapashaunaka|इन्द्रोतदैवापशौनक
2. Indrota Daivāpa Śaunaka is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 5, 3, 5; 4, 1; Sāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xvi. 7, 7; 8, 27. as the priest who officiated at the horse sacrifice of Janamejaya, although this honour is attributed in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 2) viii. 21. to Tura Kāvaṣeya. He also appears in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 3) iii. 40, 1. as a pupil of Śruta, and is mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 4) Indische Studien, 4, 384, 385. He cannot be connected in any way with Devāpi, who occurs in the Rigveda. 5) x. 98. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 240.

ibha|इभ
1. Ibha is a word of somewhat doubtful sense and interpretation. It is found only in the Saṃhitās, 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 2, 14, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 9. and especially in the Rigveda. 2) i. 84, 17; iv. 4, 1; ix. 57, 3, and perhaps vi. 20, 8. According to Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 246, 247. the sense is ‘retainer,’ and Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 167. thinks that it includes not only dependants and servants, but also the royal family and the youthful cadets of the chief families. In the opinion of Pischel and Geldner 6) Vedische Studien, 1, xv, xvi. it denotes ‘elephant.’ This view is supported by the authority of the commentators Sāyaṇa 7) On Taittirīya Saṃhitā, loc. cit. and Mahīdhara; 8) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit. the Nirukta, 9) vi. 12. It gives also the sense ‘retainer,’ and in Aśoka's Edicts, No. 5, Bühler, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 37, 279, finds a Vaiśya denoted by its Pāli form. too, gives ‘elephant’ as one of the senses of the word. Megasthenes 10) Apud Strabo, 704. and Nearchos 11) Ibid., 705. tell us that elephants were a royal prerogative, and the derivative word Ibhya may thus be naturally explained as denoting merely ‘rich’ (lit., ‘possessor of elephants’). 12) But it may equally well be explained as ‘rich’ from the other sense of the primary word: ‘possessor of (many) retainers.’

ibha|इभ
2. Ibha in one passage of the Rigveda 1) vi. 20, 8. Cf. Pischel and Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, xvi; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 380. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 167, treats it as ‘retinue,’ as does Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 246, 247. appears certainly to be intended as an abbreviation of the proper name Smadibha. 

ibhya|इभ्य
इभ्य<BR> occurs once in the Rigveda 1) i. 65, 4. in the plural, when a king is said to devour his Ibhyas as the fire the forest; and twice in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 2) i. 10, 1. 2. in one passage as the first member of a compound, and in the other as either a proper name or an adjective. Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Ludwig, 4) Translation of the Rigveda 3, 247. and Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 168. interpret the word as ‘retainers’ in the Rigveda, but in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad Roth thinks it means ‘rich.’ Pischel and Geldner 6) Vedische Studien, 1, xvi. Cf. Sāyaṇa on Rigveda, loc. cit., dhaninaḥ, and Śaṃkara on Chāndogya Upaniṣad, loc. cit., īśvaro hastyāroho vā; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 476. Cf. also Little, Grammatical Index, 35. accept the sense in all passages. Böhtlingk in his translation of the Chāndogya treats the word as simply a proper name, ‘Ibhya's village’ (ibhya-grāma) and ‘Ibhya.’

iriNa|इरिण
इरिण<BR> (neut.) occurs not rarely in the later Saṃhitās 1) Av. iv. 15, 12; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 1, 3; iii. 4, 8, 5; v. 2, 4, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, ix. 16. and Brāhmaṇas 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 3, 2; vii. 2, 1, 8. in the sense of ‘a cleft in the ground,’ usually natural (sva-kṛta). The same meaning is also, as Pischel 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 222-225. shows, to be ascribed to it in three passages of the Rigveda, 4) i. 186, 9; viii. 4, 3; 87, 1. 4. in one 5) viii. 4, 3. of which the hole is referred to as ‘made by water’ (apā kṛtam). In another passage of the Rigveda 6) x. 34, 1. 9. the word refers to the place on which the dice are thrown. Hence Pischel 7) Op. cit., 2, 225. concludes that the dicing-board must have been so called because it contained holes into which the dice had to be thrown if possible. Lüders, 8) Das Würfelspiel im alben Indian, 14. however, points out that this assumption is not necessary; the dice (Akṣa) were merely thrown on a space dug out, which could be called Iriṇa, as being a hole in the ground, though not a natural one. This view is supported by the commentary of Sāyaṇa, 9) On Rv., loc. cit. (ā-sphūra). as well as by Durga in his note on the Nirukta. 10) ix. 8 (āsphuraka-sthāna). 

iShashyaavaashvi|इषश्यावाश्वि
इष श्यावाश्वि<BR> is mentioned in a Vaṃśa (‘list of teachers’) of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iv. 16, 1) as a pupil of Agastya.

iShiikaa|इषीका
इषीका,<BR> ‘a stalk of reed grass,’ occurs frequently from the Atharvaveda 1) Av. vii. 56, 4; xii. 2, 54; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 3, 4, 16, etc.; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 9; ii. 134; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 24, 3; Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad, ii. 6, 17, etc.; Nirukta, ix. 8. onwards, often as an emblem of fragility. In the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 2) ii. 16 (v. l. ºike). it seems to denote the pin fixed in the bar of a pen to keep cattle in (argaleṣīke, ‘bolt and pin’). A basket (śūrpa) of Iṣīkā is referred to in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 3) i. 1, 4, 19. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71; Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 122, n. 3.

iShu|इषु
इषु<BR> is the usual name for ‘arrow’ from the Rigveda 1) ii. 24, 8; viii. 7, 4, etc.; Av. i. 13, 4, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 3, etc.; Nirukta, ix. 18. onwards. Other names are Śarya, Śārī, and Bāṇa. In the hymn of the Rigveda, 2) vi. 75, 15. which gives a catalogue of armour, two kinds of arrows are distinctly referred to: the one is poisoned (ālāktā), and has a head of horn (ruru-śīrṣṇī); the other is copper-, bronze-, or iron-headed (ayo-mukham). Poisoned (digdhā) arrows are also referred to in the Atharvaveda. 3) iv. 6, 7; v. 18, 8. 15; 31, 4. The arrows were feathered. 4) Rv. x. 18, 14; vi. 75, 11; Av. v. 25, 1. The parts of an arrow are enumerated in the Atharvaveda 5) iv. 6. as the shaft (śalya), the feather-socket (parṇa-dhi), the point (śṛṅga), the neck of the point in which the shaft is fixed (kulmala), and the Apaskambha and Apāṣṭha, which are of more doubtful significance. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 6) i. 25. the parts of an arrow are given as the point (anīka), the śalya, tejana, and the feathers (parṇāni), where śalya and tejana must apparently mean the upper and lower parts of the shaft, since it is reasonable to suppose that the arrow is described as a whole consecutively. So in the Atharvaveda 7) Av. iii. 25, 2. the arrow of Kāma is described as having feathers, a shaft (śalya), and a firm fastening (kulmala). 8) See also Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 8, 1. 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxv. 1. The arrow was shot from the ear, and so is described in the Rigveda 9) Rv. vi. 75, 3; ii. 24, 8 (karṇayoni). as ‘having the ear for its place of birth.’ As a measure of length, the Iṣu was five spans, say three feet. 10) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 5, 2, 10. A regular profession of arrow-making existed (iṣu-kṛt, 11) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 46, Cf. Rv. i. 184, 3. iṣu-kāra). 12) Ibid., xxx. 7; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 3, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 300; Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 29, 286; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 275 et seq.; 25, 337.

iShutrikaaNDaa|इषुत्रिकाण्डा
इषु त्रि-काण्डा<BR> is the name given in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) iii. 33. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 205, n. to some constellation, perhaps Orion's girdle. It is mentioned with Mṛga, Mṛgavyādha, and Rohiṇī.

iShudhi|इषुधि
इषु-धि<BR> (‘arrow-holder’) is the name of the quiver which was carried by every bowman. The word is common from the Rigveda 1) i. 33, 3; vi. 75, 5; x. 95, 3; Av. ii. 33, 2; iv. 10, 6, etc.; Nirukta, ix. 13. onwards. No trace is to be found in Vedic literature of the later practice of carrying two quivers. 2) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 274. Each quiver held from ten to twenty arrows. According to Pischel, 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 17. But see Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 182. the curious expression iṣu-kṛt in the Rigveda 4) i. 184, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 300. means quiver. Ī.

iiShaa|ईषा
ईषा<BR> denotes the ‘pole of a chariot.’ Normally the chariot had one pole (ekeṣaḥ), 1) Rv. x. 135, 3; iii. 53, 17; viii. 5, 29; Av. viii. 8, 23. but sometimes two poles are referred to. 2) Cf. Av. ii. 8, 4; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 12 (īṣā-yugāni, but in iii. 9, 4, 3 dual); Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, vii. 9, 14, etc. The word is often 3) Av., loc. cit., etc. compounded with Yuga, ‘yoke,’ into which it was fastened (see Kha), and tied with ropes. 4) Rv. x. 60, 8. Cf. iii. 6, 6. Exactly how it was attached to the chariot we do not know. 5) Vāṇī in Rv. i. 119, 5 is taken by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 249, to refer to the front part of the chariot, but it seems simply to be ‘voice.’ See also Ratha. U.

uxan|उक्षन्
उक्षन्<BR> See Go.

uxaNyaayana|उक्षण्यायन
उक्षण्यायन<BR> is mentioned in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda 1) viii. 25, 22. along with Harayāṇa and Suṣāman. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 162, 270. thinks that all three are identical. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. finds a reference to Ukṣan himself in the verb ukṣaṇyati 4) Rv. viii. 26, 9. and in the adjective ukṣaṇyu. 5) Rv. viii. 23, 16.

uxNorandhrakaavya|उक्ष्णोरन्ध्रकाव्य
उक्ष्णो-रन्ध्र काव्य<BR> is mentioned as a seer in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 9, 19). 1) Cf. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 397.

ukhaa|उखा
उखा<BR> is the regular word or a ‘cooking pot,’ usually mentioned in connexion with sacrifice, from the Rigveda 1) i. 162, 13. 15; iii. 53, 22; Av. xii. 3, 23; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 6, 3, etc. onwards. It was made of clay (mṛṇ-mayī). 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 59; Taitdrīya Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 5, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 253, 271. See also Sthālī.

ugra|उग्र
उग्र<BR> in one passage of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1) iv. 3, 37. 38. seems to have a technical force, denoting ‘man in authority,’ or according to Max Müller's rendering, ‘policeman.’ Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. compares a passage in the Rigveda, 3) vii. 38, 6. where, however, the word has simply the general sense of ‘mighty man.’ Böhtlingk, 4) P. 66 (with pratyenasaḥ). in his rendering of the Upaniṣad, treats the word as merely adjectival.

ugradeva|उग्रदेव
उग्र-देव<BR> is mentioned with Turvaśa and Yadu in the Rigveda 1) i. 36, 18 (Ugrādeva). apparently as a powerful protector. The name occurs also in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 2) xiv. 3, 17; xxiii. 16, 11. and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, 3) v. 4, 12. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 147; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., who suggests that in the Rv. passage the word should be taken adjectivally. where he is styled Rājani and called a leper (kilāsa). 

ugrasena|उग्रसेन
उग्र-सेन<BR> is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 5, 4, 3), and in a Gāthā there cited as being, with Bhīmasena and Śrutasena, a Pārikṣitīya and a brother of Janamejaya. The brothers were cleansed by the horse sacrifice from sin.

uchchaiHshravaskaupayeya|उच्चैःश्रवस्कौपयेय
उच्चैः-श्रवस् कौपयेय<BR> appears in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 29, 1-3) as a king of the Kurus and as maternal uncle of Keśin. His connexion with the Kurus is borne out by the fact that Upamaśravas was son of Kuruśravaṇa, the names being strikingly similar.

uchChiirShaka|उच्छीर्षक
उच्-छीर्षक<BR> --This word, occurring in the description of the couch (paryaṅka) in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 1) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 403; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 155. (i. 5), apparently denotes a cushion for the head. See also Āsandī.

uttarakuru|उत्तरकुरु
उत्तर कुरु<BR> --The Uttara Kurus, who play a mythical part in the Epic and later literature, are still a historical people in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 1) viii. 14. where they are located beyond the Himālaya (pareṇa Himavantam). In another passage, 2) viii. 23. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 165; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 101, 102; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 75, n. however, the country of the Uttara Kurus is stated by Vāsiṣṭha Sātyahavya to be a land of the gods (deva-kṣetra), but Jānaṃtapi Atyarāti was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not wholly mythical. It is reasonable to accept Zimmer's view that the northern Kurus were settled in Kaśmīr, especially as Kurukṣetra is the region where tribes advancing from Kaśmīr might naturally be found. Cf. Udīcyas.

uttaramadra|उत्तरमद्र
उत्तर मद्र<BR> is the name of a tribe mentioned with the Uttara Kurus in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) viii. 14. as living beyond the Himālaya. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 102. points out that in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa 3) Indische Studien, 4, 371. Kāmboja Aupamanyava is a pupil of Madragāra, and thence infers that Kambojas and Madras were not far distant in space. This conclusion is perfectly reasonable in view of the probable position of the Kāmbojas. 4) See map in Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, p. 332. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 165.

uttaanaaangirasa|उत्तानआङ्गिरस
उत्-तान आङ्गिरस<BR> is mentioned in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 1) ii. 3, 2, 5. Cf. ii. 2, 5, 3. as a quasi-mythical person who received all good things, and yet was not harmed, as he was really a form of the earth, according to Sāyaṇa's 2) On Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 2, 5. explanation. His name occurs also in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 3) ix. 9. the Pancaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 4) i. 8, 11. and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka. 5) iii. 10, 2. 3.

udagayana|उदगयन
उदग्-अयन<BR> See Sūrya.

udankashaulbaayana|उदङ्कशौल्बायन
उद्-अङ्क शौल्बायन<BR> --His views on Brahman, which he identified with the vital airs (prāṇa), are mentioned in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (iv. 1, 3). He would thus have been a contemporary of Janaka of Videha. He is also mentioned in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (vii. 5, 4, 2) as holding that the Daśarātra ceremony was the prosperity or best part of the Sattra (‘sacrificial session’).

udancana|उदञ्चन
उद्-अञ्चन<BR> --This word, occurring only metaphorically in the Rigveda, 1) v. 44, 13 (dhiyām udañcanaḥ, ‘a very well of prayers’). means a ‘pail’ or ‘bucket’ in the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 32; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 3, 5, 21.

udamayaaatreya|उदमयआत्रेय
उदमय आत्रेय<BR> is mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 22) as Purohita, or domestic priest, of Aṅga Vairocana.

udarashaaNDilya|उदरशाण्डिल्य
उदर शाण्डिल्य<BR> is mentioned as a teacher in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 1) i. 9, 3. and as a pupil of Atidhanvan Śaunaka in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 2) Indische Studien, 4, 384.

udala|उदल
उदल,<BR> a Vaiśvāmitra, is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃsa Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 11, 33) as the seer of a Sāman. 

udaaja|उदाज
उद्-आज<BR> is the word used in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 1) i. 10, 16; iv. 3, 1. to denote the share of the booty of war taken by the king after a victory (saṃgrāmaṃ jitvā). This interpretation, which is that of Delbrück, 2) Festgruss an Böhtlingk, 25. is clearly correct, as against the older version, ‘march out,’ given by von Schroeder 3) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 1, xv. and accepted by Böhtlingk. 4) Dictionary, s.v. The Udāja thus corresponds precisely with the Homeric  This sense also suits Nirāja, the variant of both the Kāṭhaka 5) xxviii. 3. and the Kapiṣṭhala 6) xliv. 3. Saṃhitās.

udaana|उदान
उदान<BR> is usually the fifth of the vital breaths (Prāṇa) when five are enumerated. 1) E.g., Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 12, 9; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, v. 4; 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ix. 2, 2, 5; xi. 8, 3, 6 (in the order Prāṇa, Vyāna, Apāna, Udāna, Samāna); Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 5, 3; iii. 4, 1 (Samāna is omitted); iii. 9, 26; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iii. 13, 5; v. 23, 1. 2; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 3, 3, etc. Sometimes 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 20; vii. 27; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ix. 4, 2, 10, etc. (with Vyāna); Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 2 (with Samāna). it appears as the second, coming after Prāṇa, and followed by Vyāna or Samāna. Again, 3) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vi. 20; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 2, 2; ix. 2, 4, 5, etc. it is found simply opposed to Prāṇa, or it simply follows Prāṇa and Apāna. 4) Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, viii. 8; xi. 1. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5) xi. 2, 4, 5. it is treated as the breath that consumes food, a notion traceable in the later Upaniṣads, 6) Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad, ii. 6. while it is also regarded as the wind that rises up by the throat, 7) Amṛtabindu Upaniṣad, 34. and leads the spirit forth at death. 8) Praśna Upaniṣad, iii. 7. Cf. Deussen, Philosophy of the Upaniṣads, 280.

udiichyas|उदीच्यस्
उद्-ईच्यस्<BR> --The Brāhmaṇas of the northern parts are referred to in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xi. 4, 1, 1. Cf. Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 6. as engaging, with Svaidāyana Śaunaka as their spokesman, in a dispute with the Kurupañcāla Brāhmaṇa Uddālaka Āruṇi, and as vanquishing him. Their relation to the Kurupañcālas appears also from the fact that in the same Brāhmaṇa 2) iii. 2, 3, 15. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 191; Lévi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 35. reference is made to the speech of the north being similar to that of the Kurupañcālas. The speech of the Northerners was also celebrated for purity; hence Brāhmaṇas used to go to the north for purposes of study, according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, 3) vii. 6. Cf. Weber, op. cit., 1, 153; 2, 309. while in the Buddhist texts the school of Takṣaśilā (in Gandhāra) is famous as a resort of students. 4) Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 8, 28, 203. Possibly, too, Sanskrit was specially developed in Kaśmīr, as suggested by Franke. 5) Cf. Pāli und Sanskrit (1902), 88, 89. See also Kuru.

udumbara|उदुम्बर
उदुम्बर<BR> --This name of the Ficus glomerata does not occur in the Rigveda, but is often found from the Atharvaveda 1) xix. 31, 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 1, 6, etc.; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 1, 33; vii. 4, 1, 38, etc. onwards. For ritual purposes of all kinds its wood was constantly used. The sacrificial post (yūpa) 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 1, 6. and the sacrificial ladle 3) Ibid., v. 4, 7, 3. were made of it, and amulets of Udumbara are mentioned. 4) Atharvaveda, xix. 31, 1. Its wood, like that of other kinds of figtree-Aśvattha, Nyagrodha, and Plakṣa--was considered suitable for employment at the sacrifice. 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 8, 4. The sweetness of its fruit is referred to in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 6) vii. 15. where it is put on the same level as Madhu. It is there also spoken of as ripening three times a year. 7) v. 24. A forest of Udumbara trees is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 8) xvi. 6, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 59.

uddaalakaaaruNi|उद्दालकआरुणि
उद्दालक आरुणि<BR> --Uddālaka, son of Aruṇa, is one of the most prominent teachers of the Vedic period. He was a Brāhmaṇa of the Kurupañcālas, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) xi. 4, 1, 2. Cf. Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 6. This statement is confirmed by the fact that he was teacher of Proti Kausurubindi of Kauśāmbī, 2) xii. 2, 2, 13. and that his son Svetaketu is found disputing among the Pañcālas. 3) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 1; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 3, 1. He was a pupil of Aruṇa, his father, 4) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 33 (in both recensions). as well as of Patañcala Kāpya, 5) Ibid., iii. 7, 1. of Madra, while he was the teacher of the famous Yājñavalkya 6) Ibid., vi. 3, 15; 4, 33. Vājasaneya and of Kauṣītaki, 7) Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xv. although the former is represented elsewhere 8) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 7, 31. as having silenced him. He overcame in argument Prācīnayogya Śauceya, 9) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 3, 1 et seq. and apparently also Bhadrasena Ājātaśatrava, 10) v. 5, 5, 14. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 141, has Āraṇi. There is a chronological difficulty in taking Āruṇi as meant, since Ājātaśatrava must presumably have been a descendant of Ajātaśatru, a contemporary of Janaka (see Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv. 1), who again was a patron of Yājñavalkya, a pupil of Āruṇi. But this difficulty is not fatal. though the text here seems to read the name as Āraṇi. He was a Gautama, 11) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 3, 2; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, i. 1. and is often alluded to as such. As an authority on questions of ritual and philosophy, he is repeatedly referred to by his patronymic name Āruṇi in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 12) i. 1, 2, 11; ii. 2, 1, 34; iii. 3, 4, 19; iv. 4, 8, 9; xi. 2, 6, 12. the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 13) iii. 5, 1. the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 14) iii. 11, 4; v. 11, 2; 17, 1; vi. 8, 1. and occasionally in the Aitareya, 15) viii. 7. the Kauṣītaki, 16) xxvi. 4. and the Ṣaḍviṃśa 17) i. 6. Brāhmaṇas, as well as the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad. 18) i. 1 et seq. In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā he is not mentioned, according to Geldner, 19) Vedische Studien, 3, 146. but only his father Aruṇa; his name does not occur, according to Weber, 20) Indian Literature, 69. But cf. xxiii. 1, 5. in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, but in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 21) vii. 8. Cf. viii. 6. he is, as Āruṇi, known as a contemporary of Divodāsa Bhaimaseni, and in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 22) i. 42, 1. he is mentioned as serving Vāsiṣṭha Caikitāneya. In the Taittirīya tradition he seldom appears. There is an allusion in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 23) vii. 2, 2, 1 (a late passage). to Kusurubinda Auddālaki, and according to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 24) iii. 11, 8, 1 et seq. Naciketas was a son of Vājaśravasa Gautama, who is made out to be Uddālaka by Sāyaṇa. 25) On Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. Cf. Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad, i. 11. But the episode of Naciketas, being somewhat unreal, cannot be regarded as of historical value in proving relationship. Aruṇa is known to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. A real son of Uddālaka was the famous Śvetaketu, who is expressly reported by Āpastamba 26) See Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, 2, xxxviii; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 39. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 170, n.; 2, 201, 202; Oldenberg, Buddha, 396, n.; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xl., xli. to have been in his time an Avara or later authority, a statement of importance for the date of Āruṇi.

uddaalakaayana|उद्दालकायन
उद्दालकायन<BR> is mentioned as a pupil of Jābālāyana in the second Vaṃśa (list of teachers) contained in the Kāṇva recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (iv. 6, 2).

udra|उद्र
उद्र<BR> is the name of an animal occurring only in the list of sacrificial victims at the Aśvamedha given in the Saṃhitās of the Yajurveda. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 20, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 18; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 37. According to Mahīdhara 2) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit. it was a crab; but as the commentary on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 3) Loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95, 96; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 247. Udrin occurs in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ii. 5. calls it a watercat, there can be no doubt that it was an otter.

uddhi|उद्धि
उद्धि<BR> 1) Av. viii. 8, 22; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 2, 2, 2; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 3, 8. denotes some part of a chariot, probably the seat, 2) So Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 506; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 149. but, according to Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. the frame resting on the axle.

upaketu|उपकेतु
उप-केतु<BR> is the name of a man mentioned in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (xiii. 1).

upakosalakaamalaayana|उपकोसलकामलायन
उप-कोसल कामलायन<BR> is mentioned as a teacher and a pupil of Satyakāma Jābāla in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (iv. 10, 1; 14, 1). 

upakvasa|उपक्वस
उप-क्वस<BR> is the name in the Atharvaveda (vi. 50, 2) of a noxious insect injurious to seed. Sāyaṇa, however, reads the word as a plural adjective (a-pakvasaḥ = a-dagdāḥ), but the Paippalāda recension supports the form upakvasaḥ. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 237; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 486; Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 318.

upagusaushravasa|उपगुसौश्रवस
उप-गु सौश्रवस<BR> is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 6, 8) as Purohita of Kutsa Aurava, by whom he was murdered because of his paying homage to Indra. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 268; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 57.

upachit|उपचित्
उप-चित्<BR> occurs in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 1) xii. 97. as the name of a disease, which Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. renders as ‘swelling,’ and which Bloomfield 3) Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, October, 1887, xviii. identifies with Apacit.

upajihvikaa|उपजिह्विका
उप-जिह्विका, उप-जीका, उप-दीका<BR> are all forms of one word denoting a species of ant. 1) Upajihvikā is the form in Rv. viii. 102, 21; upajīkā in Av. ii. 3, 4; vi. 100, 2; but upacīkā in both passages in the Paippalāda recension; upadīkā in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 3, 4; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, v. 1, 4; 10, 9; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1, 1, 8. To these ants is attributed in the Atharvaveda 2) vi. 100, 2. Cf. Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 7, 482 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 511; Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 41, 354; Bergaigne and Henry, Manuel Védique, 153. the power of penetrating to water which possesses curative properties. They were accordingly used in all sorts of spells against poisoning. The belief in their healing qualities was no doubt due to the well-known properties of the earth of ant-heaps which contains their water.

upadhaana|उपधान
उप-धान<BR> denotes the ‘cushion’ of a seat (Āsandī) in the Atharvaveda (xiv. 2, 65). It corresponds to the Upabarhaṇa of other texts. 

upadhi|उपधि
उप-धि<BR> occurs once each in the Rigveda 1) ii. 39, 4. and the Atharvaveda, 2) vi. 70, 3. in conjunction with Pradhi, denoting part of the wheel of a chariot. It is impossible to decide exactly what part is meant. Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 248 (ignoring the Atharvaveda passage). and Bloomfield, 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 493. agree in thinking that the word denotes the spokes collectively. Whitney, 6) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 334. considering this improbable, prefers to see in it the designation of a solid wheel, Pradhi being presumably the rim and Upadhi the rest. Other possibilities 7) Bloomfield, loc. cit. are that the Upadhi is a rim beneath the felly, or the felly itself as compared with the tire (ordinarily Pavi).

upaniShad|उपनिषद्
उप-निषद्<BR> in the Brāhmaṇas 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 3, 5, 12; 4, 5, 1; 5, 1, 1; xii. 2, 2, 23, etc.; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 1, 10; 13, 4; viii. 8, 4. 5; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 1, 20; iv. 2, 1; v. 5, 3; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 1, 6; 2, 5; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, ii. 1, etc. normally denotes the ‘secret sense’ of some word or text, sometimes the ‘secret rule’ of the mendicant. But in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2) ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 2; 5, 11. it is already used in the plural as the designation of a class of writings, no doubt actually existing and similar to the Upaniṣads in the nature of their subject-matter and its treatment. Similarly the sections of the Taittirīya Upaniṣad end with the words ity upaniṣad. The Aitareya Āraṇyaka 3) iii. 1, 1. commences its third part with the title ‘The Upaniṣad of the Saṃhitā,’ and the title occurs also in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka. 4) vii. 2. Cf. Taittirīya Upaniṣad, i. 3, 1. The exact primary sense of the expression is doubtful. The natural derivation, adopted by Max Müller 5) Sacred Books of the East, 1, xxxiii et seq. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 204. and usual ever since, makes the word mean firstly a session of pupils, hence secret doctrine, and secondly the title of a work on secret doctrine. Oldenberg, 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 50, 457; 54, 70; Die Literatur des alten Indien, 72. however, traces the use of the word to the earlier sense of ‘worship’ (cf. upāsana). Deussen 7) Philosophy of the Upaniṣads, 16 et seq. considers the original sense to have been ‘secret word,’ next ‘secret text,’ and then ‘secret import,’ but this order of meaning is improbable. Hopkins 8) Religions of India, 218. suggests that Upaniṣad denotes a subsidiary treatise, but this sense does not account naturally for the common use as ‘secret meaning,’ which is far more frequent than any other.

upapati|उपपति
उप-पति,<BR> ‘the gallant,’ is mentioned with the Jāra, ‘lover,’ in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 1) xxx. 9; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 4, 1. as a victim in the human sacrifice (puruṣamedha).

upabarhaNa|उपबर्हण
उप-बर्हण<BR> denotes a ‘pillow’ or ‘cushion,’ especially of a seat (āsandī), occurring in the Rigveda, 1) x. 85, 7. the Atharvaveda, 2) ix. 5, 28; xii. 2, 19. 20; xv. 3, 7. and the Brāhmaṇas. 3) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 12; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 8, 4, 10; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, i. 5; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 6, 10; 6, 8, 9; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxviii. 4, etc. The feminine Upabarhaṇī is found in the Rigveda with the same sense, but used metaphorically of the earth.

upamanthanii|उपमन्थनी
उप-मन्थनी<BR> is used in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1) vi. 3, 13. to denote ‘churning sticks.’ In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 2) xxx. 12; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 8, 1. the ‘churner’ (upamanthitṛ) is included in the list of victims at the human sacrifice (puruṣamedha), and the verb upa-manth is often used of churning or mixing fluids. 3) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 8, 4. 5; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 1, 6; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 2, 4.

upamanyu|उपमन्यु
उप-मन्यु<BR> is, according to Ludwig, 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 113. the name of a person in the Rigveda, 2) i. 102. 9. but is more probably explained by Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. as a mere epithet. 

upamashravas|उपमश्रवस्
उपम-श्रवस्<BR> is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 33, 6. 7. as a son of Kuruśravaṇa, and grandson of Medhātithi. The exact force of the reference to him in however, uncertain. According to the Bṛhaddevatā, 2) vii. 35. 36, with Macdonell's notes. followed by Ludwig, 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165. and by Lanman, 4) Sanskrit reader, 386, 389. the poet in the hymn consoles Upamaśravas for the death of his grandfather, Medhātithi. Geldner, 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 150, n. on the other hand, thinks that the poet, who was Kavaṣa Ailūṣa, was ill-treated by his patron's son, Upamaśravas, and cast into a ditch or well, where he uttered his complaint and appeal for mercy. But of this there is no adequate evidence, and the tradition of the Bṛhaddevatā seems sound.

upamit|उपमित्
उप-मित्<BR> occurs twice in the Rigveda, 1) i. 59, 1; iv. 5, 1. and once in the Atharvaveda, 2) ix. 3, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 153; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 596; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 525. as the designation of some part of a house. The passages in the Rigveda leave little doubt that the word means an upright pillar. As it is, in the Atharvaveda, coupled with Parimit and Pratimit, the conclusion is natural that the latter word denotes the beams supporting the Upamit, presumably by leaning against it at an angle, while Parimit denotes the beams connecting the Upamits horizontally. These interpretations, however, can only be conjectural. See also Gṛha.

upara|उपर
उपर,<BR> which, according to Pischel, 1) Vedische Studien, 1, 109. This is the sense of the form upala (Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxv. 8, etc.). means ‘stone’ in general, is the technical name of the stone on which the Soma plant was laid in order to be pounded for the extraction of the juice by other stones (adri, grāvan). The word is rare, occurring only thrice in the Rigveda, 2) i. 79, 3; x. 94, 5; 175, 3. and once in the Atharvaveda. 3) vi. 49, 3. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 154; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 317; Von Schroeder, Mysterium und Mimus, 414. 

upalapraxiNii|उपलप्रक्षिणी
उपल-प्रक्षिणी<BR> occurs once in the Rigveda, 1) ix. 112, 3. where it designates the occupation of a woman, as opposed to that of her son, who is a poet (kāru), and to that of his father, who is a physician (bhiṣaj). Yāska 2) Nirukta, vi. 5. renders the word by ‘maker of groats’ (saktu-kārikā), and Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Grassmann, 4) Ibid., s.v., ‘fitting the upper (to the lower) millstone.’ Zimmer, 5) Altindisches Leben, 269. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedaschrestomathie, s.v., who, taking pṛc in the sense of ‘fill,’ explains the compound as ‘filling the upper millstone,’ an interpretation which as it stands is unintelligible. as well as others, connect it with the operation of grinding corn. Pischel, 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 308-310. however, who points out that corn was not ground between two stones, but beaten on a stone with a pestle (dṛṣad), considers that Upala-prakṣiṇī denotes a woman that assisted at the crushing of Soma (cf. Upara). Von Schroeder, 7) Mysterium und Mimus, 412 et seq. Von Schroeder does not accept the view that the mother of the singer is alluded to; but it seems impossible to draw any other conclusion from the language of the passage, and his own explanation of the word as referring to a corn-mother is very improbable; cf. Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 204. who more correctly points out that there is no objection to regarding upala as the mortar in which the corn was placed and then beaten with the pestle, renders the word literally as ‘one who fills the (lower) stone (with corn).’

upalaa|उपला
उपला<BR> in the Brāhmaṇas 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 1, 22; ii. 1, 14, 17; ii. 2, 2, 1, etc. Cf. Von Schroeder, Mysterium und Mimus, 413, n. 3. may denote the upper and smaller ‘stone,’ which was used as a pestle with the Dṛṣad as the mortar, whereas Upara in the Saṃhitās denotes rather the mortar, and Dṛṣad the pestle. But see Dṛṣad.

upavaaka|उपवाक
उप-वाक<BR> occurs in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 1) xix. 22; 90; xxi. 30 (as ‘healing’). and the Brāhmaṇas 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 7, 1, 3; 2, 9, etc. as a description of a species of grain, the Wrightia antidysenterica, known later as Indra-yava. The commentator Mahīdhara 3) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 22. simply glosses it with the more general term Yava. According to the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, it formed the essential element of gruel (karambha), and Upavāka groats (saktavaḥ) are mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 4) xii. 9, 1, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 240, 270.

upaveshi|उपवेशि
उप-वेशि<BR> is mentioned as a pupil of Kuśri in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 5, 3, in both recensions). See also Aupaveśi.

upashrii|उपश्री
उप-श्री, उप-श्रय,<BR> are two readings of the same term. The former is found in one recension of the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, 1) i. 5. while the latter is probably the reading of the other recension of the Upaniṣad, 2) See Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 20, n. 3. and certainly the reading in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 3) xv. 3, 8. Cf. Whitney's note in his Translation. though the text has apaśrayaḥ, which is accepted as possible by Roth. 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and still followed by Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. In both cases the term clearly means something connected with a couch (Āsandī in the Atharvaveda, Paryaṅka in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad). Aufrecht, 5) Indische Studien, 1, 131. Roth, 6) S.v. apaśraya. and Max Müller 7) Sacred Books af the East, 1, 278. render it as ‘coverlet’ or ‘cushion,’ but Whitney 8) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 777. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 402; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 155. seems evidently right in holding that it must mean a ‘support’ or something similar.

upastaraNa|उपस्तरण
उप-स्तरण<BR> denotes in the description of the couch (Paryaṅka) in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 1) i. 5. a ‘coverlet,’ and has this sense, used metaphorically, in the Rigveda 2) ix. 69, 5. also. In the Atharvaveda 3) v. 19, 12. it seems to have the same meaning. Whitney, 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 254. however, renders it ‘couch,’ though he translates 5) Ibid., 776. the parallel word Āstaraṇa in another passage 6) xv. 3, 7. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 403; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 155. by ‘cushion.’ 

upasti|उपस्ति
उप-स्ति<BR> denotes both in the Rigveda 1) x. 97, 23 (= Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xii. 101; Av. vi. 15, 1). and the Atharvaveda 2) iii. 5, 6. a ‘dependent,’ just as later in the Epic 3) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 92. the subordination of the Vaiśya to the two superior castes is expressed by the verb upa-sthā, ‘stand under,’ ‘support.’ The word also appears, with the same sense, in the form of Sti, but only in the Rigveda. 4) vii. 19, 11; x. 148, 4; sti-pa, vii. 66, 3; x. 69, 4. The exact nature of the dependence connoted by the term is quite uncertain. Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 184, 185. conjectures that the ‘dependents’ were the members of defeated Aryan tribes who became clients of the king, as among the Greeks, Romans, and Germans, the term possibly including persons who had lost their freedom through dicing. 6) Rv. x. 34. The evidence of the Atharvaveda 7) Av. iii. 5, 6. 7. shows that among the Upastis were included the chariot-makers (ratha-kāra), the smiths (takṣan), and the charioteers (sūta), and troop-leaders (grāma-ṇī), while the Rigveda passages negative the possibility of the ‘subjects’ (sti) being the whole people. It is therefore fair to assume that they were the clients proper of the king, not servile, but attached in a special relation to him as opposed to the ordinary population. They may well have included among them not only the classes suggested by Zimmer, but also higher elements, such as refugees from other clans, as well as ambitious men who sought advancement in the royal service. Indeed, the Sūta and the Grāmaṇī were, as such, officers of the king's household--kingmakers, not themselves kings, as they are described in the Atharvaveda. 8) iii. 5, 7. The use of the word in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 9) vii. 2, 5, 4. Cf. vi. 5, 8, 2. the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 10) iii. 3, 5, 4. and the Kāṭhaka, 11) xxxi. 9. is purely metaphorical, as well as in the one passage of the Rigveda in which it occurs. In the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda, 12) iii. 5, 7. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 246; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 92; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 196 et seq. Vaiśya, Śūdra, and Ārya are referred to as Upastis, perhaps in the general sense of ‘subject.’ 

upastuta|उपस्तुत
उप-स्तुत<BR> is mentioned several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 36, 10. 17; 112, 15; viii. 5, 25; x. 115, 8. always as a sage of old, and usually in connexion with Kaṇva, who was aided or favoured by Agni, the Aśvins, and other gods. The Upastutas, sons of Vṛṣṭihavya, 2) x. 115, 9. are mentioned as singers 3) viii. 103, 8; x. 115, 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 108; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 152, 153.

upahvara|उपह्वर
उप-ह्वर<BR> denotes, in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 87, 2. according to Geldner, 2) Vedische Studien, 3, 40. the body of a chariot (upa-stha).

upaanasa|उपानस
उपानस<BR> is in the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 14, 2. opposed to Akṣa, and must mean something like ‘the body of the wagon,’ though Sāyaṇa suggests that it signifies either a ‘granary’ or a ‘wagon full of grain.’ In the Rigveda, 2) x. 105, 4. where the word occurs only once, its sense is doubtful. Pischel 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 197. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 301; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 56. explains the form which occurs there not as an adjective, but as an infinitive.

upaanah|उपानह्
उपा-नह्<BR> is the regular word for a ‘sandal’ or ‘shoe’ from the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 4, 4, 4; 6, 6, 1, etc. onwards. Boarskin is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) v. 4, 3, 19. as a material of which shoes were made. The combination ‘staff and sandals’ (daṇḍopānaha) occurs as early as the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa. 3) iii. 3.

upaavijaanashruteya|उपाविजानश्रुतेय
उपावि जान-श्रुतेय<BR> is mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (i. 25, 15) as an authority on the Upasads (a kind of Soma ceremony).

upoditigaupaaleya|उपोदितिगौपालेय
उपोदिति गौपालेय<BR> is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xii. 13, 11) as a seer of Sāmans.

ubhayaadant|ubhayaadat|उभयादत्|उभयादन्त्
उभया-दन्त्,<BR> ‘having incisors in both jaws,’ is an expression employed to distinguish, among domestic animals, the horse, the ass, etc., from the goat, the sheep, and cattle. The distinction occurs in a late hymn of the Rigveda, 1) x. 90, 10. and is several times alluded to in the later Saṃhitās 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 6, 3; v. 1, 2, 6; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 8, 1. and the Brāhmaṇas. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 30 (ubhayato-dant). In one passage of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 4) ii. 2, 6, 3. man is classed with the horse as ubhayā-dant. The opposite is anyato-dant, ‘having incisors in one jaw only,’ a term regularly applied to cattle, 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 1, 5; v. 1, 2, 6; 5, 1, 3. the eight incisors of which are, in fact, limited to the lower jaw. The ass is styled ubhayā-dant in the Atharvaveda. 6) v. 31, 3. In one passage of the Atharvaveda, 7) v. 19, 2. however, the epithet is applied to a ram; but the sense here is that a marvel occurs, just as in the Rigveda 8) viii. 18, 17. a ram destroys a lioness. Bloomfield 9) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 434. suggests in the Atharvaveda passage another reading which would mean ‘horse.’ A parallel division of animals is that of the Taittirīya 10) iv. 3, 10, 2. and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitās 11) xiv. 30. into ‘whole-hoofed’ (eka-śapha) and ‘small’ (kṣudra). Zimmer 12) Altindisches Leben, 74-76. seeks to show from the Greek  13) Aristotle, Hist. An., ii. 1, 8. and the Latin ambidens 14) Festus apud Paulum Diaconum Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 58. that the Indo-European was familiar with the division of the five sacrificial animals into the two classes of man and horse on the one hand, and cattle, sheep, and goats on the other. But this supposition is not necessary.

uraa|उरा
उरा<BR> as a name for ‘sheep’ is confined to the Rigveda. 1) viii. 34, 3. It is curious that in one of its two occurrences the wolf should be referred to as terrifying sheep, and that the epithet of the wolf, urā-mathi, ‘killing sheep,’ should occur once in the Rigveda, 2) viii. 66, 8. Cf. Nirukta, v. 21. both references being in one book of the Saṃhitā, a fact which suggests a dialectical origin of the word urā. See also Avi. 

urukaxa|उरुकक्ष
उरु-कक्ष<BR> occurs in only one passage of the Rigveda, 1) vi. 45, 31. where the sense of the word is much disputed. The reading of the text is uruḥ kakṣo na gāṅgyaḥ, which may refer to a man, Urukakṣa, ‘dwelling on the Ganges,’ 2) Grassmann; St. Petersburg Dictionary. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 291. or to a man, son of Gaṅgā, or to a wood so called, 3) Ludwig's translation (der wald Urukakṣa, or das weite dickicht). or may simply denote the ‘broad thicket on the Ganges.’ 4) Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 28, n. 5; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 396.

uruxaya|उरुक्षय
उरु-क्षय<BR> --A family of Urukṣayas, singers and worshippers of Agni, is referred to in one hymn of the Rigveda (x. 118, 8. 9). Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 167.

urunjiraa|उरुञ्जिरा
उरुञ्जिरा<BR> is given in the Nirukta (ix. 26) as one of the names of the river Vipāś (now Beäs).

urvaraa|उर्वरा
उर्वरा<BR> is with Kṣetra the regular expression, from the Rigveda 1) i. 127, 6; iv. 41, 6; v. 33, 4; vi. 25, 4; x. 30, 3; 142, 3, etc.; Av. x. 6, 33; 10, 8; xiv. 2, 14, etc. onwards, denoting a piece of ‘ploughland’ (). Fertile (apnasvatī) fields 2) Rv. i. 127, 6. are spoken of as well as waste fields (ārtanā). 3) Ibid. Intensive cultivation by means of irrigation is clearly referred to both in the Rigveda 4) vii. 49, 2. and in the Atharvaveda, 5) i. 6, 4; xix. 2, 2. while allusion is also made to the use of manure. 6) Av. iii. 14, 3, 4; xix. 31, 3. The fields (kṣetra) were carefully measured according to the Rigveda. 7) i. 110, 5. This fact points clearly to individual ownership in land for the plough, a conclusion supported by the reference of Apālā, in a hymn of the Rigveda, 8) viii. 91, 5. to her father's field (urvarā), which is put on the same level as his head of hair as a personal possession. Consistent with this are the epithets ‘winning fields’ (urvarā-sā, urvarā-jit, kṣetra-sā), 9) Rv. iv. 38, 1, and vi. 20, 1; ii. 21, 1; iv. 38, 1. while ‘lord of fields’ used of a god 10) viii. 21, 3. Cf. Kṣetra. is presumably a transfer of a human epithet (urvarā-pati). Moreover, fields are spoken of in the same connexion as children, 11) Rv. iv. 41, 6, etc. and the conquest of fields (kṣetrāṇi saṃ-ji) is often referred to in the Saṃhitās. 12) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 8, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, v. 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 12, 3. Very probably, as suggested by Pischel, 13) Vedische Studien, 2, 204-207. the ploughland was bounded by grass land (perhaps denoted by Khila, Khilya) which in all likelihood would be joint property on the analogy of property elsewhere. There is no trace in Vedic literature of communal property in the sense of ownership by a community of any sort, 14) Cf. Baden Powell, Indian Village Community (1899); Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236; Mrs. Rhys Davids, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1901, 860. nor is there mention of communal cultivation. Individual property in land seems also presumed later on. In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 15) vii. 24, 2. the things given as examples of wealth include fields and houses (āyatanāni). The Greek evidence 16) Cf. Diodorus, ii. 40; Arrian, Indica, 11; Strabo, p. 703; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 87 et seq. Cf. ibid., 20, 22, 23. also points to individual ownership. The precise nature of the ownership is of course not determined by the expression ‘individual ownership.’ The legal relationship of the head of a family and its members is nowhere explained, and can only be conjectured (see Pitṛ). Very often a family may have lived together with undivided shares in the land. The rules about the inheritance of landed property do not occur before the Sūtras. 17) Cf. Gautama Dharma Sūtra, xviii. 5 et seq.; Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra, ii. 2, 3; Āpastamba Dharma Sūtra, ii. 6, 14. Of course, the rules probably go back to the earlier period, but how far it is impossible to say. With the settlement of the country, however, inheritance of land and its partition must have become inevitable. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 18) xiii. 6, 2, 18; 7, 1, 13. 15. the giving of land as a fee to priests is mentioned, but with reproof: land was no doubt even then a very special kind of property, not lightly to be given away or parted with. 19) It is significant that in the famous episode (Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 9, 4) of Manu's division of his property, from which Nābhānediṣṭha was excluded, this exclusion is made good by the son's obtaining cattle (paśavaḥ). It is clear that cattle, not land, was the real foundation of wealth, just as in Ireland, Italy (cf. pecunia), Greece, etc. Cattle could be, and were, used individually, but land was not open to a man's free disposal; no doubt, at any rate, the consent of the family or the community might be required, but we are reduced to reliance on analogy in view of the silence of the texts. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 289; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 94-96; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 48 et seq. On the relation of the owners of land to the king and others see Grāma; on its cultivation see Kṛṣi.

urvaaruu|उर्वारू
उर्वारू,<BR> f., Urvāruka, n., ‘cucumber.’ The former 1) Av. vi. 14, 2. of these words denotes the plant, the latter 2) Rv. vii. 59, 12 = Av. xiv. 1, 17 = Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 10, 4 = Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 6, 2 = Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 60. the fruit, but both are very rare. The passages all seem to refer to the fact that the stem of the plant becomes loosened when the fruit is ripe. 3) Sāyaṇa on Av. vi. 14, 2. The fruit is also called Urvāru in a Brāhmaṇa. 4) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ix. 2. 19. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 242.

ula|उल
उल<BR> is the name of some unknown wild animal, perhaps, as Whitney 1) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 669. suggests, the ‘jackal.’ It is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 2) xii. 1, 49. and later Saṃhitās, 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 12, 1 (as ūla); Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 13, 12; 14, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 31. Cf. ulala in Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ii. 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 82. but not definitely identified by the commentators.

ulavaarShNivRddha|उलवार्ष्णिवृद्ध
उल वार्ष्णि-वृद्ध<BR> is mentioned as a teacher in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (vii. 4).

ulapa|उलप
उलप<BR> 1) x. 142, 3. is the name of a species of grass referred to in the Rigveda and the later Saṃhitās. 2) Av. vii. 66, 1. Adjectives derived from the word are ulapya (Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 45, etc.) and upolapa (Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 7, 2).

ulukyajaanashruteya|उलुक्यजानश्रुतेय
उलुक्य जान-श्रुतेय<BR> is mentioned as a teacher in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (i. 6, 3). 

uluuka|उलूक
उलूक<BR> is the ordinary word for ‘owl’ from the Rigveda 1) x. 165, 4. onwards. The bird was noted for its cry, 2) Rv. loc. cit. and was deemed the harbinger of ill-fortune (nairṛta). 3) Av. vi. 19, 2: Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 18, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 38. Owls were offered at the horse sacrifice to the forest trees, 4) Vājasaneyi Samhitā, xxiv. 23; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14. 4. no doubt because they roosted there.

uluukhala|उलूखल
उलूखल<BR> is the regular expression for ‘mortar’ from the Rigveda 1) i. 28, 6; Av. x. 9, 26; xi. 3, 3; xii. 3, 13: Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 8, 7; vii. 2, 1, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 4, 6, etc. onwards, occurring frequently also in the compound 2) Av. ix. 6, 15; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 1, 22 Ulūkala-musala, ‘mortar and pestle.’ The exact construction of the vessel is quite unkown till we reach the Sūtra period.

ulkaa|उल्का
उल्का<BR> regularly denotes a meteor from the Rigveda 1) iv. 4, 2; x. 68, 4; Av. xix. 9, 8, Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vi. 8, etc. onwards. In the Brāhmaṇas 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 4, 19. it also signifies a ‘firebrand.’ The much rarer form Ulkuṣī 3) As ‘meteor,’ Av. v. 17, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 2, 7, 21; as ‘firebrand,’ ibid., iii. 9, 2, 9. has both senses.

ulmuka|उल्मुक
उल्मुक<BR> is the common word in the Brāhmaṇas 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 11; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 2, 1; ii. 1, 4, 28, etc.; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 76 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 239) for ‘firebrand,’ from which a coal (aṅgāra) 2) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 4, 3, 3; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 61, 1 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 23, 342). could be taken.

ulmukavaxayaNa|उल्मुकवक्षयण
उल्मुकवक्षयण<BR> is an expression that occurs several times in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) iv. 6. 8, 7; v. 2, 4, 15; xi. 6, 3, 3; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 76. Cf. Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. signifying a ‘means of extinguishing (ava-kṣayaṇa) a firebrand,’ or possibly more precisely ‘tongs.’ Compare Aṅgārāvakṣayaṇa. 

ushanaskaavya|उशनस्काव्य
उशनस् काव्य<BR> is an ancient seer, already a half-mythical figure in the Rigveda, 1) i. 51, 10; 83. 5; 121, 12; iv. 16, 2; vi. 20, 11; viii. 23, 17; ix. 87, 3; 97, 7; x. 40, 7; probably also i. 130, 9; v. 31, 8; 34. 2; viii. 7, 26; x. 22, 6. Also in Av. iv. 29, 6. where he is often mentioned, especially as associated with Kutsa and Indra. Later on 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 8, 5: Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vii. 5, 20; Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xiv. 27, 1. he becomes the Purohita of the Asuras in their contests with the gods. A variant of his name is Kavi Uśanas. 3) Rv. iv. 26, 1. He appears in the Brāhmaṇas as a teacher also. 4) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 12, 5; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. ii. 7. 2, 6. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 167 et seq.; Bergaingne, Religiou Vidique, 2, 339. et seq.; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 147.

ushanaa|उशना
उशना<BR> occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (iii. 4, 3, 13; iv. 2, 5, 15) as the name of a plant from which Soma was prepared.

ushiinara|उशीनर
उशीनर<BR> --In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇā 1) viii. 14. the Kuru-Pañcālas are mentioned as dwelling together in the ‘Middle Country’ with the Vaśas and the Uśīnaras. In the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 2) iv. 1. See Keith Śāṅkhāyana Āranyaka, 36. also the Uśīnaras are associated with the Kuru-Pañcālas and Vaśas, but in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa 3) ii 9. the Uśīnaras and Vaśas are regarded as northerners. In the Rigveda 4) x. 59, 10. the people is alluded to in one passage by reference to their queen, Uśīnarāṇī. Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 130. thinks that the Uśīnaras earlier lived farther to the north-west, but for this there is no clear evidence. His theory is based merely on the fact that the Anukramaṇī (Index) of the Rigveda ascribes one hymn 6) Rv. x. 179. to Śibi Auśīnara, and that the Śibis were known to Alexander's followers as , 7) Diodorus, xvii. 19. living between the Indus and the Akesines (Chenab). But this is in no way conclusive, as the Śibis, at any rate in Epic times, 8) See Pargiter's map. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908. p. 322. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 213, 419; Hultzsch Indian Antiquary, 34, 179. occupied the land to the north of Kurukṣetra, and there is no reason whatever to show that in the Vedic period the Uśīnaras were farther west than the ‘Middle Country.’ 

uSha|उष
उष,<BR> ‘salt ground,’ occurs as a variant of Ūṣa in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (i. 6, 3).

uShastachaakraayaNa|उषस्तचाक्रायण
उषस्त चाक्रायण<BR> is mentioned as a teacher in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka (iii. 5, 1) and Chāndogya (i. 10, 1; 11, 1) Upaniṣads, the name in the latter work appearing as Uṣasti.

uShTi|उष्टि
उष्टि, उष्ट्र<BR> --Both of these words, of which the former is quite rare, 1) Perhaps in Rv. x. 106, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 21, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 2. must have the same sense. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Aufrecht 3) Cited in Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 468. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 224. hold that in the Rigveda 4) i. 138, 2; viii. 5, 37; 6, 48; 46, 22. 31; Av. xx. 127, 2; 132, 13; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 50. and the Brāhmaṇas 5) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1, 2, 3, 9, etc.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 8. the sense is ‘humped bull’ or ‘buffalo,’ but the former thinks that in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 6) xxiv. 28. 39. the sense is doubtful, and ‘camel’ may be meant. Hopkins 7) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 83. is decidedly of opinion that the sense in every case is ‘camel.’ The animal was used as a beast of burden yoked in fours. 8) Av. xx. 127, 2; Rv. viii. 6, 48.

uShNiiSha|उष्णीष
उष्णीष<BR> denotes the ‘turban’ worn by Vedic Indians, men and women 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 2, 3; iv. 5, 2, 7 (used at the sacrifice to wrap the embryo in); xiv. 2, 1, 8 (Indrāṇī's Uṣṇīṣa), etc.; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiii. 10. alike. The Vrātya's turban is expressly referred to in the Atharvaveda 2) xv. 2, 1. and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 3) xvii. 1, 14. Cf. xvi. 6, 13. A turban was also worn at the Vājapeya 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 5, 23. and the Rājasūya 5) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 3. ceremonies by the king as a token of his position.

uShyala|उष्यल
उष्यल<BR> occurs once in the description of the couch or the bridal car in the Atharvaveda, 1) xiv. 1, 60. where it seems to mean the four ‘frame-pieces.’ The form is doubtful: uṣpala is possible. 2) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 385. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 155; Whitney, op. cit., 752. 

usra|उस्र
उस्र,<BR> m.; Usrā, f.; Usrika, m.; Usriya, m.; Usriyā, f. All these words denote a ‘bull’ or a ‘cow,’ occurring frequently in the Rigveda, 1) Usra, Rv. vi. 12, 4; usrā, i. 3, 8; viii. 75, 8; 96, 8; ix. 58, 2, etc.; usrika, i. 190, 5; usriya, v. 58, 6 (with vṛṣabhaḥ); ix. 74. 3; usriyā, i. 153, 4; 180, 3; ii. 40, 2, etc. In ix. 70, 6, usriya is applied to a calf; and in ix. 68, 1; 93, 2, usriyā means ‘milk.’ and sometimes later, 2 Usrau dhūrṣāhau, Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iv. 33; usrā, Av. xii. 3, 37; usriya, Av. i. 12, 1; usriyā, Av. ix. 4, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxv. 2. 3. In Av. v. 20, 1; 28, 3, it means ‘cowhide,’ or perhaps in v. 28, 3, ‘milk.’ but usually with some reference to the morning light. In some passages the sense is doubtful. See Go. Ū.

Urjayantaupamanyava|ऊर्जयन्तौपमन्यव
ऊर्जयन्त् औपमन्यव<BR> is mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. as a pupil of Bhānumant Aupamanyava.

Urjayantii|ऊर्जयन्ती
ऊर्जयन्ती<BR> is regarded by Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 152. in one passage of the Rigveda 2) ii. 13, 8. as the name of a fort, the stronghold of Nārmara. The verse is, however, quite unintelligible. 3) Sāyaṇa makes Urjayantī a Piśācī; Grassmann, the sun; Roth, s.v. ūrjay, takes it adjectivally. Cf. Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 199.

Urjavya|ऊर्जव्य
ऊर्जव्य,<BR> a word occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) v. 41, 20. is taken by Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155. to be the name of a sacrificer. Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. however, regards the word as an adjective meaning ‘rich in strength,’ and this is the more probable interpretation.

UrNanaabhii|ऊर्णनाभी
ऊर्ण-नाभी,<BR> 1) Ūrṇa-nābhi (‘having wool in its navel’), Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 5; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 1, 23; ūrṇa-vābhī (‘wool-spinner’), Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, viii. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 5, 1, 23; ūrṇā-vant (‘possessing wool’), Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xix. 3 (in a Mantra). Ūrṇa-vābhi, Ūrṇā-vant are all names of the spider in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas in allusion to the insect's spinning threads of wool, as it were. 

UrNaa|ऊर्णा
ऊर्णा,<BR> ‘wool,’ is very frequently mentioned from the Rigveda 1) iv. 22, 2; v. 52, 9; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 5, 1, 13: 7, 2, 10, etc.; ūrṇāyu, ‘woolly,’ Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 50; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xii. 11, 10. onwards. The Paruṣṇī country was famous for its wool, 2) Rv., loc. cit.; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 210. But cf. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 315. like Gandhāra 3) Rv. i. 126, 7. for its sheep. The term for the separate tufts was parvan 4) Rv. iv. 22, 10. or parus. 5) Rv. ix. 15, 6. ‘Soft as wool’ (ūrṇa-mradas) 6) Rv. v. 5, 4; x. 18, 10; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ii. 2: iv. 10; xxi. 33, etc. is not a rare epithet. The sheep is called ‘woolly’ (ūrṇāvatī). 7) Rv. viii. 56, 3. ‘Woollen thread’ (ūrṇā-sūtra) is repeatedly referred to in the later Saṃhitās 8) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 9; Kāṭhaka Samhitā, xxxviii. 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 80, etc. Cf. ūrṇā-stukā, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 28; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxv. 3. and the Brāhmaṇas. 9) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 7, 2, 11, etc. The word ūrṇā was not restricted to the sense of sheep's wool, 10) Cf. anaiḍakīr ūrṇāḥ (‘wool not coming from the eḍaha,’ a species of sheep) in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5 2, 15. but might denote goat's hair also. 11) Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 83, n.

UrNaavatii|ऊर्णावती
ऊर्णा-वती<BR> --In the hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 75. 8. which celebrates the rivers Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3. 200. finds a reference to an affluent of the Indus called Ūrṇāvatī. This interpretation, however, seems certainly wrong. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. renders the word merely as ‘woolly,’ and Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben. 429. rejects Ludwig's explanation on the ground that it throws the structure of the hymn into confusion. Pischel 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 210. makes the word an epithet of the Indus, ‘rich in sheep.’

Urdara|ऊर्दर
ऊर्दर<BR> --This word occurs once in the Rigveda, 1) ii. 14, 11. when reference is made to filling Indra with Soma as one fills an Ūrdara with grain (Yava). Sāyaṇa renders it granāry, but Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 238. seem more correct in simply making it a measure for holding grain, or ‘garner.’

Ula|ऊल
ऊल<BR> is a variant of Ula.

USha|ऊष
ऊष<BR> in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 3, 2, etc. and Brāhmaṇas 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 27; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 1, 16, etc. denotes salt ground suited for cattle. Cf. Uṣa. Ṛ.

Rxa|ऋक्ष
1. Ṛkṣa, ‘bear,’ is found only once in the Rigveda, 1) v. 56, 3. and seldom later, 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 17; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 36; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 184. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 81. the animal having evidently been scarce in the regions occupied by the Vedic Indians. Not more frequent 3) Rv. i. 24, 10; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa. ii. 1, 2, 4; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, i. 11, 2. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 422. is the use of the word in the plural to denote the ‘seven bears,’ later called the ‘seven Ṛṣis,’ 4) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 144 (D). the constellation of the ‘Great Bear’ (, ursa).

Rxa|ऋक्ष
2. Ṛkṣa is the name of a patron mentioned in one verse of a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 68, 15. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. his son being referred to in the next verse as Ārkṣa.

Rxaakaa|ऋक्षाका
ऋक्षाका<BR> is a word occurring once in an obscure passage of the Atharvaveda. 1) xviii. 2, 31. The sense is quite unknown. Weber 2) Festgruss an Roth, 138, n. 2; Berlin Catalogue, 2, 59, 11.; Proccedings of the Berlin Academy, 1895, 856. thinks it refers to the ‘milky way,’ but his view rests on no evidence. Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 840. despairs of the passage. 

Rxiikaa|ऋक्षीका
ऋक्षीका,<BR> a word found in the Atharvaveda, 1) xii. 1, 49. the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 2) xxx. 8. and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 3) xiii. 2, 4, 2. 4. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 307. appears to denote a demon. Harisvāmin, however, in his commentary on the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, connects the word with Ṛkṣa, as meaning ‘bear.’

Rgveda|ऋग्वेद
ऋग्-वेद,<BR> the formal name of the collection of Ṛcs, first appears in the Brāhmaṇas, 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 32, and implied in Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 12, 9, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 5, 4, 6; 8, 3; xii. 3, 4, 9. and thereafter frequently in the Āraṇyakas 2) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 2, 3. 5; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, viii. 3. 8. and Upaniṣads. 3) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 5, 12; ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 6; 5, 11; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 3, 7; iii. 1, 2. 3; 15, 7; vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1.

Rjishvan|ऋजिश्वन्
ऋजिश्वन्<BR> is mentioned several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 51, 5; 53, 8; 101, 1; vi. 20, 7; viii. 49, 10; x. 99, 11; 138, 3. but always in a vague manner, as if very ancient. He assists Indra in fights against demoniac figures like Pipru and the dusky brood (kṛṣṇa-garbhāḥ). According to Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 143, 149. he was called Auśija's son, 3) Rv. x. 99, 11. Cf. Auśija. but this is doubtful. He is twice 4) Rv. iv. 16, 13; v. 29, 11. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 161 (C). clearly called Vaidathina, or descendant of Vidathin.

Rjuunas|ऋजूनस्
ऋजूनस्<BR> is mentioned once only in the Rigveda 1) viii. 52, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. along with six other Soma sacrificers.

Rjraashva|ऋज्राश्व
ऋज्राश्व<BR> appears in the Rigveda 1) i. 100, 16. 17. as one of the Vārṣāgiras, along with Ambarīṣa, Surādhas, Sahadeva, and Bhayamāna, and as apparently victorious in a race. Elsewhere 2) i. 116, 17; 117, 16. 17. in the Rigveda he is celebrated as having been blinded by his father for slaying one hundred rams for a she-wolf, and as having been restored to sight by the Aśvins, a legend of quite obscure meaning. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 52.

RNa|ऋण
ऋण,<BR> ‘debt,’ is repeatedly mentioned from the Rigveda 1) ii. 27, 4, etc., usually in a metaphorical sense. onwards, having apparently been a normal condition among the Vedic Indians. Reference is often made 2) Rv. x. 34, 10; Av. vi. 119, 1. to debts contracted at dicing. To pay off a debt was called ṛṇaṃ saṃ-nī. 3) Rv. viii. 47, 17 = Av. vi. 46, 3. Allusion is made to debt contracted without intention of payment. 4) Av. vi. 119, 1. The result of non-payment of a debt might be very serious: the dicer might fall into slavery. 5) Rv. x. 34. Cf. Lüders, Das Wūrfelspiel im alten Indien, 61. Debtors, like other malefactors, such as thieves, were frequently bound by their creditors to posts (dru-pada), 6) Rv. x. 34, 4, seems to refer rather to the binding and taking away as a slave, though Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 228, explains it as the binding of a debtor for non-payment, interpreting the obscure verse i. 169, 7, in the same way. But Av. vi. 115, 2, 3, may refer to debt, and if this is the meaning the allusion to binding to a post as a punishment is clear. See, however, Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 528, n. 1; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 364, who interprets the hymn as referring only to sin. Rv. i. 24, 13. 15; Av. vi. 63, 3 = 84, 4; 121, 1 et seq., are general; while Rv. vii. 86, 5; Av. xix. 47, 9; 50, 1, refer to the binding of thieves in the stocks. Cf. Taskara. presumably as a means of putting pressure on them or their friends to pay up the debt. The amount of interest payable is impossible to make out. In one passage of the Rigveda and Atharvaveda 7) Rv. viii. 47, 17 = Av. vi. 46, 3. an eighth (śapha) and a sixteenth (kalā) are mentioned as paid, but it is quite uncertain whether interest or an instalment of the principal is meant. Presumably the interest would be paid in kind. How far a debt was a heritable interest or obligation does not appear. The Kauśika Sūtra 8) xlvi. 36-40. See Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, 154; Bloomfield, op. cit., 528. regards three hymns of the Atharvaveda 9) vi. 117-119. The name for unpaid debt is in Av. vi. 117, 1, apamityam apratītam. In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 3, 8, 1, kusīdam apratīttam; in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 14, 17, and Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 3, 1, 8, kusīdam apratītam; in the Mantra Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3. 20, apradattam. as applicable to the occasion of the payment of a debt after the creditor's decease. For the payment of a debt. by a relation of the debtor the evidence is still less clear. 10) Cf. Rv. iv. 3, 13 (a brother's sin or debt); Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 99, 100. Zimmer 11) Altindisches Leben, 181. This suggestion is ignored by Bloomfield, op. cit., 375, and Whitney, op. cit., 304. thinks that payments of debt were made in the presence of witnesses who could be appealed to in case of dispute. This conclusion is, however, very uncertain, resting solely on a vague verse in the Atharvaveda. 12) vi. 32, 3 = viii. 8, 21. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 14, and see Jñātṛ. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 181, 182; 259.

RNaMchaya|ऋणंचय
ऋणं-चय,<BR> a prince of the Ruśamas, is celebrated in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) of the Rigveda (v. 30, 12. 14) for his generosity to a poet named Babhru. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 129; Bṛhadevatā, ed. Macdonell, 2, 169, 174.

Rtu|ऋतु
ऋतु,<BR> ‘season,’ is a term repeatedly mentioned from the Rigveda 1) i. 49, 3; 84, 18, etc. onwards, Three seasons of the year are often alluded to, 2) Cf. Rv. i. 164, 2 (tri-nābhi), 48 (trīṇi nabhyāni); also perhaps the Ṛbhus as the genii of the three seasons and the three dawns. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 133; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 33 et seq.: Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1, 1, 28, and the cāturmāsyāni, or four-monthly sacrifices performed at the beginning of the seasons in the ritual (Weber, Naxatra, 2, 329 et seq.). but the names are not usually specified. In one passage of the Rigveda 3) x. 90, 6. Hillebrandt, op. cit., 2, 35, finds in Rv. v. 14, 4: ix. 91, 6, reference to three seasons in the triad gāvaḥ (? spring), āpaḥ (rains), svar (= gharma), and in the ritual literature (Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 4, 2) in the threefold division into ṛta, gharma, and oṣadhi. spring (vasanta), summer (grīṣma), and autumn (śarad) are given. The Rigveda knows also the rainy season (prā-vṛṣ) and the winter (himā, hemanta). A more usual 4) Av. viii. 2, 22; 9, 15; xiii. 1, 18; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 2, 3; iv. 3, 3, 1. 2; v. 1, 10, 3; 3, 1, 2; 4. 12, 2; 6. 10, 1; 7, 2, 4; vii. 1, 18, 1. 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 7, 3; iii. 4, 8; 13, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, iv. 14; ix. 16; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 10-14; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 5, 11; vi. 2, 2, 3. etc.; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 4, 1; 11, 10, 4, etc. Cf. Rv. i, 164, 13. See also Weber, op. cit., 2, 352. division (not found in the Rigveda) is into five seasons, vasanta, grīṣma, varṣā, śarad, hemama-siśira, but occasionally the five are otherwise divided, varṣā-śarad being made one season. 5) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 6, 1, 10. 11. Sometimes six 6) Av. vi. 55, 2; xii. 1, 36; Taittīrīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 5, 2; 7, 3; 2. 6, 1, etc.; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 7, 3; iii. 11, 12; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, viii. 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 23-28; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 2, 21; ii. 4, 2, 24; xii. 8, 2, 34; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 19, etc. Cf. also Rv. i. 23, 15, as interpreted by Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. indu. seasons are reckoned, hemanta and śiśira being divided, so that the six seasons can be made parallel to the twelve months of the year. A still more artificial arrangement 7) Av. vi. 61, 2; viii. 9, 18; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5, 1, 15; ix. 1, 2, 31; 2, 3, 45; 3, 1, 19; 5, 2, 8; perhaps Av. iv. 11, 9, and of. Rv. i. 164. 1. makes the seasons seven, possibly by reckoning the intercalary month as a season, as Weber and Zimmer 8) Indische Studien, 18, 44; Altindisches Leben, 374. hold, or more probably because of the predilection for the number seven, as Roth 9) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. ṛtu. Cf. Hopkins, Religions of India, 18, 33. suggests. Occasionally the word ṛtu is applied to the months. 10) Av. xv. 4; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 11, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 25; xiv. 6. 15. 26. 27; xv. 57, etc. The last season, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 11) i. 5. 3. 13. is hemanta. The growth of the division of the seasons from three to five is rightly explained by Zimmer 12) Op. cit., 373. as indicating the advance of the Vedic Indians towards the east. It is not Rigvedic, but dominates the later Saṃhitās. Traces of an earlier division of the year into winter and summer do not appear clearly in the Rigveda, where the appropriate words himā and samā are merely general appellations of the year, and where śarad 13) Hopkins, American Journal of Philology, 15, 159, 160: Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 232; Bühler, Zcitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 41, 28. is commoner than either as a designation of the year, because it denotes the harvest, a time of overwhelming importance to a young agricultural people. The division of the year in one passage of the Atharvaveda 14) viii. 9, 17. Cf. Zimmer, 372. into two periods of six months is merely formal, and in no way an indication of old tradition. 

RtuparNa|ऋतुपर्ण
ऋतु-पर्ण<BR> appears in a Brāhmaṇa-like passage of the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 1) xx. 12. as son of Bhaṅgāśvina and king of Śaphāla. In the Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra 2) xxi. 20, 3. Cf. Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 57, 745. are mentioned Ṛtuparṇa-Kayovadhī Bhaṅgyaśvinau.

Rtvij|ऋत्विज्
ऋत्व्-इज्<BR> is the regular term for ‘sacrificial priest,’ covering all the different kinds of priests employed at the sacrifice. It appears certain that all the priests were Brāhmaṇas. 1) This is assumed throughout the Vedic texts, and is accompanied by the rule that no Kṣatriya can eat of the sacrificial offering (Cf. Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 26): no doubt because only the Brāhmaṇas were sufficiently holy to receive the divine essence of the sacrifice into which, by partaking of it, the deity has entered in part. The number of priests officiating at a sacrifice with different functions was almost certainly seven. The oldest list, occurring in one passage of the Rigveda, 2) ii. 1, 2. Cf. Oldenberg. Rdigion des Veda, 383. enumerates their names as Hotṛ, Potṛ, Neṣṭṛ, Agnīdh, Praśāstṛ, Adhvaryu, Brahman, besides the institutor of the sacrifice. The number of seven probably explains the phrase ‘seven Hotṛs’ occurring so frequently in the Rigveda, and is most likely connected with that of the mythical ‘seven Ṛṣis.’ It may be compared with the eight of Iran. 3) Darmesteter, Le Zend-Avesta, 1, lxx et seq. The chief of the seven priests was the Hotṛ, who was the singer of the hymns, and in the early times their composer also. The Adhvaryu performed the practical work of the sacrifice, and accompanied his performance with muttered formulas of prayer and deprecation of evil. His chief assistance was derived from the Agnīdh, the two performing the smaller sacrifices without other help in practical matters. The Praśāstṛ, Upavaktṛ, or Maitrāvaruṇa, as he was variously called, appeared only in the greater sacrifices as giving instructions to the Hotṛ, and as entrusted with certain litanies. The Potṛ, Neṣṭṛ, and Brahman belonged to the ritual of the Soma sacrifice, the latter being later styled Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin to distinguish him from the priest who in the later ritual acted as supervisor. Other priests referred to in the Rigveda 4) Rv. viii. 81. 5. are the singers of Sāmans or chants, the Udgātṛ and his assistant the Prastotṛ, while the Pratihartṛ, another assistant, though not mentioned, may quite well have been known. Their functions undoubtedly represent a later stage of the ritual, the development of the elaborate series of sacrificial calls on the one hand, and on the other the use of long hymns addressed to the Soma plant. Other priests, such as the Achāvāka, 5) Cf., for the Achāvāka, Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxviii. 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 14, 8, etc.; Bergaigne, Recherches sur l'histoire de la liturgie védique, 47; Oldenberg. Religion des Veda, 397, n. 2. The other three occur in the Aitareya and other Brāhmaṇas. See St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. the Grāvastut, the Unnetṛ, and the Subrahmaṇya, were known later in the developed ritual of the Brāhmaṇas, making in all sixteen priests, who were technically and artificially classed in four groups 6) Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 1, 4-6; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtras, xiii. 14, 1, etc. In the Rigveda Sūtra the order of the four sets is Hotṛ, Brahman, Udgātṛ, and Adhvaryu. Sometimes a seventeenth priest is mentioned, but he was not usually approved, though the Kauṣītakins maintained him as the Sadasya. See Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 4, 1, 19; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 348, n.; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 37; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 375. Hotṛ, Maitrāvaruṇa, Achāvāka, and Grāvastut; Udgātṛ, Prastotṛ, Pratihartṛ, and Subrahmaṇya; Adhvaryu, Pratisthātṛ, Neṣṭṛ, and Unnetṛ; Brahman, Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin, Agnīdhra, and Petṛ. Apart from all these priests was the Purohita, who was the spiritual adviser of the king in all his religious duties. Geldner 7) Vedische Studien, 2, 143 et seq. holds that, as a rule, when the Purohita actually took part in one of the great sacrifices he played the part of the Brahman, in the sense of the priest who superintended the whole conduct of the ritual. He sees evidence for this view in a considerable number of passages of the Rigveda 8) Rv. i. 44, 10; 94, 6; viii. 27, 1, etc. and the later literature, 9) Bṛhaspati is Purohita of the gods, Rv. ii. 24, 9; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 1, 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 17, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 1, 2; but Brahman in Rv. x. 141, 3; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, vi. 13; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 4, 21. Vasiṣṭha is Purohita, Rv. x. 150, 5, of Sudās Paijavana, Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 11, 4; but Brahman of the Sunaḥśepa sacrifice, ibid, xv. 21. where Purohita and Brahman were combined or identified. Oldenberg, 10) Op. cit., 380 et seq. however, more correctly points out that in the earlier period this was not the case: the Purohita was then normally the Hotṛ, the singer of the most important of the songs; it was only later that the Brahman, who in the capacity of overseer of the rite is not known to the Rigveda, acquired the function of general supervision hitherto exercised by the Purohita, who was ex officio skilled in the use of magic and in guarding the king by spells which could also be applied to guarding the sacrifice from evil demons. With this agrees the fact that Agni, pre-eminently 11) Agni as Hotṛ and Purohita occurs in Rv. i. 1, 1; iii. 3, 2; 11, 1; v. 11, 2. His Purohitaship is described in terms characteristic of the Hotṛ's funcitons in Rv. viii. 27, 1; x. 1, 6. Devāpi is Purohita and Hotṛ. Rv. x. 98. the Purohita of men, is also a Hotṛ, and that the two divine Hotṛs of the Āprī hymns are called 12) Rv. x. 66, 13; in x. 70, 7, purohitāv ṛtvijā. the divine Purohitas. On the other hand, the rule is explicitly recognized in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 13) vii. 26. that a Kṣatriya should have a Brahman as a Purohita; and in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 14) iii. 5, 2, 1, etc. the Vasiṣṭha family have a special claim to the office of Brahman-Purohita, perhaps an indication that it was they who first as Purohitas exchanged the function of Hotṛs for that of Brahmans in the sacrificial ritual. The sacrifices were performed for an individual in the great majority of cases. The Sattra, 15) Oldenberg, 371. or prolonged sacrificial session, was, however, performed for the common benefit of the priests taking part in it, though its advantageous results could only be secured if all the members actually engaged were consecrated (dīkṣita). Sacrifices for a people as such were unknown. The sacrifice for the king was, it is true, intended to bring about the prosperity of his people also; but it is characteristic that the prayer 16) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 22; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 18; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 12, 6; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, v. 5, 14, etc. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 141 et seq.; 376 et seq.; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 97; Oldenberg, op. cit., 370397; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 224. for welfare includes by name only the priest and the king, referring to the people indirectly in connexion with the prosperity of their cattle and agriculture. 

Rshya|ऋश्य
ऋश्य<BR> --This is the correct 1) It appears in Av. iv. 4. 7, as Ṛśa; as Ṛṣya in Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 9. 18. spelling of a word that occurs in the Rigveda 2) viii. 4, 10. and the later literature 3) Av. iv. 4. 5. 7; v. 14, 3; i. 18. 4 (ṛśya-pad); Vājasaneyi Samhitā, xxiv. 27.37; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 33; citation in Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 25, 8, etc. meaning ‘stag,’ the feminine being Rohit. 4) Av. iv. 4, 7. Apparently deer were caught in pits (ṛśya-da). 5) Rv. x. 39, 8. The procreative power of the stag (ārśya vṛṣṇya) was celebrated. 6) Av. iv. 4, 5. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 18; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 82; Whitney. Translation of the Atharvaveda, 150, 151.

RShabha|ऋषभ
1. Ṛṣabha is the common name of the ‘bull’ from the Rigveda 1) vi. 16, 47; 28, 8; x. 91, 14, etc. onwards. 2) Av. iii. 6, 4; 23, 4, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 3, 2, etc.; vajasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 22, etc.; Pañcavimśa Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 18, etc. See also Go.

RShabha|ऋषभ
2. Ṛṣabha, king of the Śviknas, appears in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 5, 4, 15. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 9. 8-10. with the patronymic Yājñatura, as one of those who performed an Aśvamedha or horse sacrifice. He is also mentioned there 2) xii. 8, 3. 7. as having probably been the source of a saying of Gaurīviti Śāktya's.

RShabha|ऋषभ
3. Ṛṣabha is mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (vii. 17) as a son of Viśvāmitra.

RShi|ऋषि
ऋषि,<BR> ‘seer,’ is primarily a composer of hymns to the gods. In the Rigveda 1) i. 1, 2; 45, 3; viii. 43, 13, etc. reference is often made to previous singers and to contemporary poets. Old poems were inherited and refurbished by members of the composer's family, 2) i. 89, 3; 96, 2; iii. 39, 2; viii. 6. 11. 43; 76, 6, etc. but the great aim of the singers was to produce new and approved hymns. 3) i. 109, 2; ii. 18, 3; iii. 62, 7; vi. 50, 6; vii. 14, 4; 93, 1; viii. 23, 14, etc. It is not till the time of the Brāhmaṇas that the composition of hymns appears to have fallen into disuse, 4) Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 151. though poetry was still produced, for example, in the form of Gāthās, which the priests were required to compose themselves 5) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 2, 8; 3, 5. and sing to the accompaniment of the lute at the sacrifice. The Ṛṣi was the most exalted of Brāhmaṇas, 6) Rv. ix. 96, 6, etc. Cf. Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 4, 4, 6, where preeminence is assigned to a Brāhmaṇa descended from a Ṛṣi. and his skill, which is often compared with that of a carpenter, 7) Rv. i. 130, 6; v. 2, 11; 29, 15; 73, 10; x. 39, 14. So a poet is a Kāru(if from kṛ, ‘make,’ but usually derived from kṛ, ‘commemorate’), and makes (kṛ, Rv. ii. 39. 8; viii. 62, 4) as well as creates (jan, Rv. vii. 15, 4; viii. 88, 4) hymns. was regarded as heaven-sent. 8) Rv. i. 37, 4; vii. 36. 1. 9; viii. 32, 27; 57. 6, etc. The Purohita, whether as Hotṛ or as Brahman (see Ṛtvij), was a singer. 9) Rv. i. 151, 7; Geldner, op. cit., 2, 153; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 380. No doubt the Ṛṣis were normally 10) Geldner, op. cit., 2, 154, cites the Dānastutis as characteristic of princes in the tradition of the Bṛhaddevatā, etc. attached to the houses of the great, the petty kings of Vedic times, or the nobles of the royal household. Nor need it be doubted that occasionally 11) Ibid., 154. the princes themselves essayed poetry: a Rājanyarṣi, the prototype of the later Rājarṣi or ‘royal seer,’ who appears in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 12) xii. 12, 6, etc. though he must be mythical as Oldenberg 13) Zeitschrift dev Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 45, 235. n. 3. points out, indicates that kings cultivated poetry 14) Later on it was deemed quite normal and natural. See the story of Rathavīti Dārbhya, or Dālbhya, himself a royal seer, and Taranta and Purumīḷha, seers and also kings, in Bṛhaddevata, v. 50 et seq. just as later they engaged in philosophic disputations. 15) Cf. Garbe, Philosophy of Ancient India, 73 et seq.; Deussen, Philosophy of the Upaniṣads, 16 et seq.; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 50. Normally, however, the poetical function is Brahminical, Viśāmitra and others not being kings, but merely Brāhmaṇas, in the Rigveda. In the later literature the Ṛṣis are the poets of the hymns preserved in the Saṃhitās. a Ṛṣi being regularly 16) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 25; viii. 26; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 4, 4; ii. 2, 3, 6; 5, 1, 4; vi, 1, 1, 1, etc.; Nirukta, vii. 3, etc. cited when a Vedic Saṃhitā is quoted. Moreover, the Ṛṣis become the representatives of a sacred past, and are regarded as holy sages, whose deeds are narrated as if they were the deeds of gods or Asuras. 17) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 17; ii. 19; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 2, 7, etc. They are typified by a particular group of seven, 18) Cf. Indische Studien, 8, 167. mentioned four times in the Rigveda, 19) iv. 42, 8; x. 109, 4; 130, 7; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 144. several times in the later Saṃhitās, 20) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 24; Av xi. 1, 1. 24; xii. 1, 39, etc. and enumerated in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 21) ii. 2, 6. as Gotama, Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra, Jamadagni, Vasiṣṭha, Kaśyapa, and Atri. In the Rigveda itself Kutsa, 22) i. 106, 6. Atri, 23) i. 117, 3. Rebha, 24) i. 117, 4. Agastya, 25) i. 179, 6. the Kuśikas, 26) iii. 53. 10. Vasiṣṭha, 27) vii. 33. 13. Vyaśva, 28) viii. 23, 16. and others appear as Ṛṣis; and the Atharvaveda 29) iv. 29. Cf. xviii. 3, 15. 16. contains a long list, including Aṅgiras, Agastī, Jamadagni, Atri, Kaśyapa, Vasiṣṭha, Bharadvāja, Gaviṣṭhira, Viśvāmitra, Kutsa, Kakṣīvant, Kaṇva, Medhātithi, Triśoka, Uśanā Kāvya, Gotama, and Mudgala. Competition among the bards appears to have been known. This is one of the sides of the riddle poetry (Brahmodya) that forms a distinctive feature 30) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 345, 346; Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 172; Religion des Veda, 216 et seq. of the Vedic ritual of the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice. In the Upaniṣad period such competitions were quite frequent. The most famous was that of Yājñavalkya, which was held at the court of Janaka of Videha, as detailed in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 31) iii. 1, 1 et seq. and which was a source of annoyance to Ajātaśatru of Kāśī. 32) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 1, 1 et seq.; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv. 1 et seq. According to an analogous practice, a Brāhmaṇa, like Uddālaka Aruṇi, would go about disputing with all he came across, and compete with them for a prize of money. 33) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 4, 1, 1 et seq.; Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3. 8 et seq.; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 185, 344. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 340347; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 3, 120 et seq.

RShis|ऋषिस्
ऋषिस्<BR> --The term ‘Seven Ṛṣis’ denotes the ‘Great Bear’ (see 1. Ṛkṣa) in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 82, 2. and occasionally later. 2) Av vi. 40, 1 (where, however, Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 310. merely renders it as ‘seven seers,’ and appears not to take it in a technical sense); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2, 4; xiii. 8, 1, 9; Nirukta, x. 26, etc. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 422; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 144. This is probably a secondary use, instead of the seven Ṛkṣas, brought about by the frequent mention of the seven Ṛṣis.

RShTi|ऋष्टि
ऋष्टि<BR> is a term frequently employed in the Rigveda 1) Rv. i. 37, 1; 64, 4. 8; 166, 4; v. 52, 6; 54, 11; 57, 6; viii. 20, 11. Indra has a Ṛṣṭi in Rv. i. 169, 3 (cf. Av. iv. 37. 8). Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 79. to designate a weapon held in the hands of the Maruts, and doubtless meant to indicate lightning. That it denotes a spear in mortal warfare, as Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 301. thinks, is not shown by a single passage. 3) Rv. i. 167. 3; vii. 55. 2; viii. 28, 5; x. 87, 7. 24 are all mythological or contain similes. Cf. Schrader, Preshistoric Antiquities, 221.

RShTiSheNa|ऋष्टिषेण
ऋष्टि-षेण<BR> is mentioned in the Nirukta 1) ii. 11. Cf. Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 130, 136. as an explanation of the patronymic Ārṣṭiṣeṇa, but nothing else is known of him.

RShyashRnga|ऋष्यशृङ्ग
ऋष्य-शृङ्ग<BR> appears as a teacher, pupil of Kāśyapa, and as bearing the patronymic Kāśyapa in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brahmaṇa 1) iii. 40, 1 (in a Vaṃśa, or list of teachers). and in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 2) Indische Studien, 4, 374, 385. The more correct spelling of the name is Ṛśya-śṛṅga. 3) The later legend connected with the name may contain old elements (see Lūders, Die Sage von Ṛshyaśṛṅga, 1897; Von Schroeder, Mysterium und Mimus, 292-301), but it is not known to any Vedic text. E.

ekadyuu|एकद्यू
एक-द्यू<BR> is mentioned as a poet in one hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 80, 10. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 112.

ekayavangaaMdama|एकयवन्गांदम
एक-यवन् गां-दम<BR> is a man mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) xxi. 14, 20. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 2) ii. 7, 11 (Kāṃdama). Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, i. 32; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 69. 

ekaraaj|एकराज्
एक-राज्,<BR> ‘sole ruler,’ ‘monarch,’ seems to mean no more than ‘king.’ In the Rigveda 1) viii. 37. 3. the term is used metaphorically only. But it is found with the literal sense in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 2) viii. 15. as well as in the Atharvaveda. 3) iii. 4, 1. Cf. Weber, Rājasūya, 141

ekaayana|एकायन
एकायन<BR> denotes some object of study in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 1) vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. The St. Petersburg Dictionary renders it ‘doctrine (ayana) of unity’ (eka), ‘monotheism,’ while Max Müller prefers ‘ethics,’ and Monier-Williams in his Dicitionary ‘worldly wisdom.’ 2) Max Müller and Monier-Williams thus follow Śaṅkara's interpretation as nīti-śāstra, ‘moral teaching.’ Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 267, 484; Little, Grammatical Index, 43.

ekaaShTakaa|एकाष्टका
एकाष्टका<BR> --That Aṣṭakā is the eighth day after the full moon appears clearly from the Atharvaveda. 1) xv. 16, 2. Cf. Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 2, 2, 23; 4, 2, 10. Ekāṣṭakā, or ‘sole Aṣṭakā,’ must denote not merely any Aṣṭakā, but some particular one. Sāyaṇa, in his commentary on the Atharvaveda, 2) iii. 10. in which a whole hymn celebrates the Ekāṣṭakā, fixes the date meant by the term as the eighth day in the dark half of the month of Māgha (January--February). The Ekāṣṭakā, is declared in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 3) vii. 4, 8 1. Cf. iii. 3, 8, 4; iv. 3, 11, 1; v. 7, 2, 2; Pañcaviṃśa Brāl maṇa, v. 9, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 305; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 341, 342. to be the time for the consecration (dīkṣā) of those who are going to perform a year long sacrifice. See also Māsa.

ejatka|एजत्क
एजत्क<BR> is the name of an insect in the Atharvaveda. 1) v. 23, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindiches Leben, 98; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 262.

eDaka|एडक
एडक<BR> appears to denote a ‘vicious ram’ in the Śatapatha 1) xii. 4, 1, 4; cf. ii. 5, 2, 15. and Jaiminīya 2) i. 51, 4 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 23, 332). Cf. Eggeling, Sacrea Books of the East, 44, 178. Brāhmaṇas. 

eNii|एणी
एणी<BR> denotes the ‘female antelope’ in the later Saṃhitās, 1) Av. v. 14, 11; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 15, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 17; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 36; Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 82. perhaps as the feminine of Eta.

eta|एत
एत<BR> in the plural (etāḥ) denotes the steeds of the Maruts, being a swift species of deer, which are mentioned several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 165. 2; 169, 6, 7; v. 54, 5; x. 77. 2. and the skins of which are also said to be worn by the Maruts on their shoulders. 2) Rv. i. 166, 10. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. The epithet pṛthubudhna, once applied to them in the Rigveda, 3) i. 169. 6. and variously interpreted as ‘broad-hoofed,’ 4) By Grassman and Zimmer. ‘broad-chested,’ 5) Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 235. and ‘broad in the hinder part,’ 6) Monier-Williams, Dictionary, s.v. seems to indicate that they were not gazelles. 7) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83.

etasha|एतश
1. Etaśa is in several passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 62, 15; iv. 30. 6; v. 29. 5. according to Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. the name of a protégé whom Indra helped against the sun-god Sūrya. But in all these passages Etaśa seems merely to designate the horse of the sun. 3) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 149. 150.

etasha|एतश
2. Etaśa is in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 1) xxx. 5. the name of a sage who is said to have cursed his children because they interrupted him in the midst of a rite; hence the Aitaśāyanas (descendants of Etaśa) are declared to be the worst of the Bhṛgus. The same story appears in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇā 2) vi. 33. Cf. Hillebrandt. Vedische Mythologie, 2, 173. where, however, the sage's name is Aitaśa, and the Aitaśāyanas are described as the worst of the Aurvas.

edidhiShuHpati|एदिधिषुःपति
एदिधिषुः-पति<BR> is a term occurring only in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 1) xxx. 9. where the commentator Mahīdhara interprets it as meaning the ‘husband of a younger sister married before the elder sister.’ Though this sense is probably correct, the form is doubtless, as Delbrück 2) Die indogermanischen Verwandschaftsnamen, 569. n. 1. points out, corrupt. See Didhiṣūpati.

eraNDa|एरण्ड
एरण्ड,<BR> the castor-oil plant (Ricinus communis), is first mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka (xii. 8).

evaavada|एवावद
एवावद<BR> is regarded by Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138. in a very obscure passage of the Rigveda 2) v. 44, 10. as the name of a singer beside Kṣatra, Manasa, and Yajata. The commentator Sāyaṇa also interprets the word as a proper name. Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. however, considers it to be an adjective meaning ‘truthful.’ AI.

aikaadashaaxamaanutantavya|ऐकादशाक्षमानुतन्तव्य
ऐकादशाक्ष मानु-तन्तव्य<BR> appears in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) v. 30. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 223. as a king who observed the rule of sacrificing when the sun had risen (udita-homin), and as a contemporary of Nagarin Jāna-śruteya.

aixvaaka|ऐक्ष्वाक
ऐक्ष्वाक,<BR> ‘descendant of Ikṣvāku,’ is the patronymic borne by Purukutsa in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) xiii. 5, 4, 5. Another Aikṣvāka is Vārṣṇi, a teacher mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 2) i. 5, 4. A king Hariścandra Vaidhasa Aikṣvāka is known to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 3) vii. 13, 16. and Tryaruṇa is an Aikṣvāka in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 4) xiii. 3, 12.

aitareya|ऐतरेय
ऐतरेय,<BR> perhaps a patronymic from Itara, though the commentator Sāyaṇa 1) Cited by Aufrecht, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 3. regards the word as a metronymic from Itarā, is an epithet of Mahidāsa in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka 2) ii. 1, 8; 3. 7. and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 3) iii. 16, 7. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 389. The form Aitareyin occurs in the Anupada Sūtra, viii. 1; Āśvalāyana Srauta Sūtra, i. 3, etc.; and a Mahaitareya in Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 4, 4, etc.

aitasha|ऐतश
ऐतश, ऐतशायन<BR> See Etaśa, Etaśāyana. The Aitaśapralāpa, or ‘Discourse of Aitaśa,’ is a part of the Atharvaveda. 1) xx. 129-132. Cf. Bṛhaddevatā, viii. 101, with Macdonell's note.

aitihaasika|ऐतिहासिक
ऐति-हासिक<BR> --This term was applied to the people who explained the Vedic hymns by treating them as legendary history (Itihāsa), as Sieg 1) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 13 et seq. shows by the passages of the Nirukta, 2) ii. 16; xii. 1, etc. where their views are opposed to those of the Nairuktas, who relied rather on etymology. Sieg 3) Op. cit., 29. also seems right in finding them in the Naidānas of the Nirukta: 4) vi. 9; vii. 6. it is possible that their textbook was called the Nidāna.

aibhaavata|ऐभावत
ऐभावत,<BR> ‘descendant of Ibhāvant,’ is the patronymic of Pratīdarśa. 1) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 8, 2, 3.

airaavata|ऐरावत
ऐरावत,<BR> ‘son of Irāvant,’ is the patronymic of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, as a snake demon, 1) In the later literature Airāvata is the elephant of Indra: perhaps connected with this Vedic snake demon. as nāga means both ‘serpent’ and ‘elephant.’ in the Atharvaveda 2) viii. 10, 29. and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 3) xxv. 15, 3.

ailuuSha|ऐलूष
ऐलूष,<BR> ‘descendant of Ilūṣa,’ is the patronymic of Kavaṣa.

aiShakRta|ऐषकृत
ऐष-कृत<BR> See Śitibāhu. 

aiShaaviira|ऐषावीर
ऐषा-वीर<BR> --The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa once 1) xi. 2, 7, 32. refers to the Aiṣā-vīras as officiating at a sacrifice, with the implication that they were bad sacrificers. Sāyaṇa regards the word as a proper name (‘descendants of Eṣavīra’), denoting the members of a despised family. But Roth may be right in explaining the word both in the passage mentioned above and elsewhere as meaning ‘weak’ 2) In the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. or ‘insignificant man.’ 3) In Böhtlingk's Dictionary, s.v. (‘one who wishes to be a man, but is not’). Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ix. 5, 1, 16; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, where, however, Lindner's edition reads saiṣā vīra iva. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 228; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 45.

aiShumata|ऐषुमत
ऐषुमत,<BR> ‘descendant of Iṣumant,’ is the patronymic of Trāta in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. O.

ogaNa|ओगण
ओगण<BR> is a word occurring only once, as a plural, in the Rigveda, 1) x. 89, 15 where it appears to indicate persons hostile to the seer of the hymn, and apparently opposed to the Āryan religion. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 209. regards the terms as the proper name of a people, but Pischel 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 191, 192. thinks that it is merely an adjective meaning ‘weak’ (ogaṇa = ava-gaṇa), as in Pāli.

otu|ओतु
ओतु<BR> in Vedic literature 1) Rv. vi. 9, 2. 3; Av. xiv. 2, 51; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 1, 4, etc. denotes the ‘woof’ in weaving and corresponds to Tantu, ‘the warp,’ the roots vā, 2) Rv. vi. 9, 2. etc. ‘to weave,’ and tan, 3) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 80; Rv. x. 130, 2; Av. x. 7, 43, etc. to stretch,’ from which these two terms are derived, being used in parallel senses. In the process of weaving a shuttle (Tasara) was used. The ‘weaver’ is termed vāya, 4) Rv. x. 26, 6, etc. and the ‘loom’ veman. 5) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 83. A wooden peg (Mayūkha) was used to stretch the web on, while lead was employed as a weight to extend it. 6) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 80. The work of weaving was probably the special care of women. 7) Av. x. 7, 42; xiv. 2, 51. Cf. Rv. i. 92. 3. A metaphor in the Atharvaveda 8) x. 7, 42; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 5, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 254, 255; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 465. personifies Night and Day as two sisters weaving the web of the year, the nights serving as warp, the days as woof.

odana|ओदन
ओदन<BR> is a common expression 1) Rv. viii. 69, 14, etc.; Av. iv. 14, 7, etc. denoting a mess, usually of grain cooked with milk (kṣīra-pākam odanam). 2) Rv. viii. 77, 10. Special varieties are mentioned, such as the ‘milk-mess’ (kṣīraudana), 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 3, 4; xi. 5, 7, 5; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 13. the ‘curd-mess’ (dadhy-odana), 4) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 14. the ‘bean-mess’ (mudgaudana), 5) Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 8. the ‘sesame-mess’ (tilaudana), 6) Ibid.; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 15. the ‘water-mess’ (udaudana), 7) Ibid., vi. 4, 15. the ‘meat-mess’ (māṃsaudana), 8) Ibid., vi. 4, 16; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 7, 5; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 8. the ‘ghee-mess’ (ghṛtaudana), 9) Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 8. etc.

opasha|ओपश
ओपश<BR> is a word of somewhat doubtful sense, occurring in the Rigveda, 1) x. 85. 8, Cf. i. 173, 6; viii. 14, 5; ix. 71. 1. the Atharvaveda, 2) vi. 138, 1. 2; ix. 3, 8, where it is applied metaphorically in describing the roof of a house. and occasionally later. 3) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 1. It probably means a ‘plait’ as used in dressing the hair, especially of women, 4) Av. vi. 138. 1, 2. but apparently, in earlier times, 5) Rv. i. 173, 6; viii. 14, 5. of men also. The goddess Sinīvālī is called svaupaśā, 6) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 5, 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 7, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 56. The reading is uncertain. Bloomfield (see below) assumes sv-opaśā to be the correct form (‘having a fair opaśa’). an epithet of doubtful sense, from which Zimmer 7) Altindisches Leben, 264. conjectures that the wearing of false plaits of hair was not unknown in Vedic times. What was the difference between the braic referred to in the epithets pṛthu ṣṭuka, 8) Rv. x. 86, 8. ‘having broad braids,’ and viṣita-ṣṭuka, 9) Rv. i. 167, 5 (of Rodasī). ‘having loosened braids,’ and the Opaśa cannot be made out from the evidence available. Geldner 10) Vedische Studien, 1, 131, quoting Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 3, where dvy-epaśāḥ is used of cattle; but the sense may be figurative. thinks that the original sense was ‘horn,’ and that when the word applies to Indra 11) Rv. viii. 14, 5. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 538, 539; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 348. it means ‘diadem.’

oShadhi|ओषधि
ओषधि<BR> --Roughly speaking, the vegetable world is divided in Vedic literature 1) Rv. x. 97 and passim. Oṣadhivanaspati is a frequent compound, from the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (vi. 1, 1, 12) onwards. The medicinal properties of plants account for the epithet ‘of manifold powers’ (nānā-vīryā) applied to them in Av. xii. 1, 2. between Oṣadhi or Vīrudh ‘plants’ and Vana or Vṛkṣa ‘trees.’ Oṣadhi is employed in opposition to Vīrudh to denote plants as possessing a healing power or some other quality useful to men, while Vīrudh is rather a generic term for minor vegetable growths, but sometimes, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 3, 2. when occurring beside Oṣadhi, signifies those plants which do not possess medicinal properties. A list of the minor parts of which a plant is made up is given in the later Saṃhitās. 3) Ibid., vii. 3, 19, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 28. It comprises the root (mūla), the panicle (tūla), the stem (kāṇḍa), the twig (valśa), the flower (puṣpa), and the fruit (phala), while trees 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 3, 20, 1. Cf. Rv. i. 32, 5; Av. x. 7, 38. have, in addition, a corona (skandha), branches (śākhā), and leaves (parṇa). The Atharvaveda 5) viii. 7, 4, with Whitney's notes. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 579; Henry, Les livres VIII. et IX. de l' Atharvavéda, 58 et seq. gives an elaborate, though not very intelligible, division of plants into those which expand (pra-stṛṇatīḥ), are bushy (stambinīḥ), have only one sheath (eka-śuṅgāḥ), are creepers (pra-tanvatīḥ), have many stalks (aṃśumatīḥ), are jointed (kāṇḍinīḥ), or have spreading branches (vi-śākhāḥ). In the Rigveda 6) x. 97. 3. 15. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben. 57. plants are termed ‘fruitful’ (phalinīḥ), ‘blossoming’ (puṣpavatīḥ), and ‘having flowers’ (pra-sūvarīḥ). AU.

auxagandhi|औक्षगन्धि
औक्ष-गन्धि<BR> (‘having the smell of bull's grease’) appears in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 37. 3. as the name of an Apsaras, beside other names, of which Guggulū and Naladī clearly indicate plants. This name, therefore, presumably also denotes some sort of fragrant plant. Aukṣa in the same Saṃhitā 2) ii. 36. 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 69; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 324; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 211, 212, and on Aukṣa, ibid., 82, 83. means ‘bull's grease’ (from akṣan, ‘bull’).

In the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 2) iii. 9, 15, 3. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Odana; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 341, n. 1. the name appears in the form of Audanyava.

audamaya|औदमय
औदमय<BR> is Weber's 1) Indische Studien, 1, 228. reading of the name of the Ātreya, who was Purohita of Aṅga Vairocana, according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 2) viii. 22. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Udamaya. Aufrecht, however, in his edition more probably takes the correct form of the name to be Udamaya. 

audavaahi|औदवाहि
औद-वाहि,<BR> ‘descendant of Udavāha,’ appears in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1) ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 26 (in the Mādhyaṃdina recension). as a teacher of Bhāradvāja.

The best known bearer of the name is the grammarian who disagreed with the onomatopetic theory of the derivation of names, and who is mentioned by Yāska. 1) i. 1; ii. 2. 6. 11, etc. An Aupamanyavīputra occurs in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 2) xxii. 1 et seq as a teacher. 

aupara|औपर
औपर,<BR> ‘descendant of Upara,’ is the patronymic of Daṇḍa in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (vi. 2, 9, 4).

aupaveshi|औपवेशि
औप-वेशि,<BR> ‘descendant of Upaveśa,’ is the patronymic borne by Aruṇa, father of Uddālaka. 1) See Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvi. 10, and Aruṇa.

aupasvatiiputra|औपस्वतीपुत्र
औपस्वती-पुत्र,<BR> ‘son of a female descendant of Upasvant’(?), is mentioned as a pupil of Pārāśarīputra in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) vi. 5, 1 (only in the Kāṇva recension).

aupaavi|औपावि
औपावि<BR> (‘descendant of Upāva’) Jāna-śruteya (‘descendant of Janaśruti’), appears in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) v. 1, 1, 5. 7. and the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 2) i. 4, 5. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 222, 223. as a sacrificer who used to offer the Vājapeya sacrifice and ascend to the other world.

aupoditi|औपोदिति
औपोदिति,<BR> ‘descendant of Upodita,’ is the patronymic applied in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) i. 7, 2, 1. to Tumiñja, and in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 2) xx. 25. to Gaupālāyana, son of Vyāghrapad, Sthapati (‘general’) of the Kurus. In the form of Aupoditeya, a metronymic from Upoditā, the name is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 3) i. 9, 3. 16. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East. 12, 271, n. 2. where the Kāṇva text calls him Tumiñja Aupoditeya Vaiyāghrapadya.

aurNavaabha|और्णवाभ
और्ण-वाभ,<BR> ‘descendant of Ūrṇavābhi.’ (1) This is the name of a pupil of Kauṇḍinya mentioned in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) iv. 5, 26 (Mādhyaṃdina recension). (2) A teacher of this name is frequently referred to in the Nirukta. His explanations in two passages 2) vii. 15; xii. 19. agree with those of the Nairuktas or etymological school of interpreters of the Rigveda. In other passages 3) vi. 13; xii. 1. he appears rather to belong to the school of the Aitihāsikas, who relied on traditional legends. He was thus probably, as Sieg 4) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 13, n. 1. suggests, an eclectic.

aurva|और्व
और्व,<BR> ‘descendant of Uru or Urva,’ appears in the Rigveda 1) viii. 102, 4. in close connexion with Bhṛgu, being probably a Bhṛgu himself. As in one passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 2) vi. 33. the descendants of Aitaśa are called the worst of the Aurvas, while the parallel version of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 3) xxx. 5. calls them the worst of the Bhṛgus, the Aurvas must have been a branch of the larger family of the Bhṛgus. Aurva himself is said in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 4) vii. 1, 8, 1. to have received offspring from Atri. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 5) xxi. 10, 6. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 54, reads ūrvau. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 173, n. 1. two Aurvas are referred to as authorities. See also Kutsa.

aulaana|औलान
औलान<BR> is a word occurring in a single passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 98, 11. where it may possibly be a patronymic of Śaṃtanu as a ‘descendant of Ula.’ Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166. however, conjectures that the reading should be ‘Kaulāna.’ Sieg 3) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 141. regards Aulāna as a later descendant 4) Cf. Sāyaṇa on Rv. x, 98, 11; Kuru kula-jātaḥ Śāṃtaṇavaḥ, ‘a descendant of Śaṃtanu, born in the family of the Kurus of Śaṃtanu, who utilized the story of Devāpi's rain-making as an introduction to his rain hymn.

auluNDya|औलुण्ड्य
औलुण्ड्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Uluṇḍa,’ is the patronymic of Supratīta in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. 

aushija|औशिज
औशिज,<BR> ‘descendant of Uśij,’ is a patronymic clearly applied to Kakṣīvant in the Rigveda. 1) i. 18, 1. It is also applied to Ṛjiśvan, 2) x. 99, 11. but Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 143, 149. thinks that the correct reading of the passage in question is auśijasyarjiśvā, ‘Ṛjiśvan, son of Auśija.’ In one verse 4) Rv. i. 112, 11. Auśija and Kakṣīvant are both mentioned, but in such a way that two different persons must apparently be meant. In other passages where the patronymic occurs alone, it is doubtful who is meant, or whether a proper name at all is intended. 5) Rv. i. 119, 9; 122, 4; iv. 21, 6, 7; v. 41, 5; vi. 4, 6. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Kakṣīvant Auśija appears also in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 6) xiv. 11, 16. See Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, xv. 56, n., and Kakṣīvant, n. 15. and elsewhere.

auShTraaxi|औष्ट्राक्षि
औष्ट्राक्षि,<BR> ‘descendant of Uṣṭrākṣa,’ occurs as the patronymic of Sāti in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 75. K.

kaMsa|कंस
कंस,<BR> a word denoting a ‘pot or vessel of metal,’ occurs in the Atharvaveda and elsewhere. 1) Av. x. 10, 5; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 10; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 3, 1, etc.; Nirukta, vii. 23; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 8.

kakara|ककर
ककर<BR> occurs in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xx. 24. as the name of a victim at the horse sacrifice (Aśvamedha). It probably denotes some ‘sort of bird,’ as rendered by the commentator Mahīdhara. 2) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94.

kakuTha|ककुठ
ककुठ,<BR> a word occurring in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 1) iii. 14, 13. presumably denotes some kind of animal. According to Böhtlingk, 2) Dictionary, s.v. it is identical with Kakkaṭa. 

kakuha|ककुह
ककुह,<BR> a word occurring several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 46, 3; 181 5; 184, 3; ii. 34, 11; iii. 54, 14; v. 73, 7; 75, 4; viii. 6, 48. is understood by Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. to designate part of a chariot, perhaps the seat. Ludwig, 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 182; 3, 160, 161; 5, 142. again, regards it in one passage 4) viii. 6, 48. as the proper name of a Yādava prince who took spoil from Tirindira, the Parśu, but this view is hardly probable. 5) Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 36, 37. It is, on the whole, most likely that the word always means ‘chief,’ ‘pre-eminent,’ being applied as an epithet to horses, chariots, princes, etc. 6) So certainly in Rv. viii. 45, 14; ix. 67, 8; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 3, 3, 1. 2, and often in the older form kakubha. This is the only sense given by Grassmann, 7) In his Lexicon, s.v. and later adopted by Roth. 8) In Böhtlingk's Dictionary, s.v.

kakkaTa|कक्कट
कक्कट<BR> denotes the ‘crab’ in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 15, 1 (where Weber has katkaṭa); Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 32. being a Prākritized form of Karkaṭa, which is common in the later literature. 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95. Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. however, takes the word to mean a bird, and compares Kakara. See also Kakuṭha.

kaxa|कक्ष
कक्ष<BR> is the name of two men mentioned as teachers in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. One is Kakṣa Vārakya, pupil of Proṣṭhapada Vārakya, 1) iii. 41, 1. and the other Kakṣa Vārāki 2) iii. 41, 1. or Vārakyā, 3) iv. 17, 1. pupil of Dakṣa Kātyāyani Ātreya. See also Urukakṣa.

kaxiivant|kaxiivat|कक्षीवत्|कक्षीवन्त्
कक्षीवन्त्<BR> is the name of a Ṛṣi mentioned frequently in the Rigveda, 1) i. 18, 1; 51, 13; 112, 11; 116, 7; 117, 6; 126, 3; iv. 26, 1; viii. 9, 10; ix. 74, 8; x. 25, 10; 61, 16. and occasionally elsewhere. 2) Av. iv. 29, 5, and passage noted below. He appears to have been a descendant of a female slave named Uśij. 3) Rv. i. 18, 1; perhaps also i, 112, 11, but Auśija may there be a separate name (see Auśija). Cf. Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 11, 16. He must have been a Pajra by family, as he bears the epithet Pajriya, 4) Rv. i. 116, 7; 117, 6. and his descendants are called Pajras. 5) Rv. i. 126, 4. In a hymn of the Rigveda 6) i. 126. he celebrates the prince Svanaya Bhāvya, who dwelt on the Sindhu (Indus), as having bestowed magnificent gifts on him; and the list of Nārāśaṃsas (‘Praises of Heroes’) in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 7) xvi. 4, 5. mentions one by Kakṣīvant Auśija in honour of Svanaya Bhāvayavya. In his old age he obtained as a wife the maiden Vṛcayā. 8) Rv. i. 51, 13. He appears to have lived to be a hundred, 9) Rv. ix. 74, 8. the typical length of life in the Vedas. He seems always to be thought of as belonging to the past, and in a hymn of the fourth book of the Rigveda 10) iv. 26, 1. he is mentioned with the semi-mythical Kutsa and Kavi Uśanas. Later, also, he is a teacher of bygone days. 11) Av. iv. 29, 5; xviii. 3, 15; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 21, 6. 7; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 11. In Vedic literature he is not connected with Dīrghatamas beyond being once mentioned along with him in a hymn of the Rigveda. 12) viii. 9, 10 But in the Bṛhaddevatā 13) iv. 11 et seq. he appears as a son of Dīrghatamas by a slave woman, Uśij. Weber 14) Episches im vedischen Ritual, 22-25. considers that Kakṣīvant was originally a Kṣatriya, not a Brāhmaṇa, quoting in favour of this view the fact that he is mentioned beside kings like Para Āṭṇāra, Vītahavya Śrāyasa, and Trasadasyu Paurukutsya. 15) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 5, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxii. 3; Pancaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 16, 3, Cf. xiv. 11, 16. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 221, 236, n. 1; Ludwig Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 102; Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 23, 24. But that these are all kings is an unnecessary assumption: these persons are mentioned in the passages in question undoubtedly only as famous men of old, to whom are ascribed mythical sacrificial performances, and who thus gained numerous sons.

kanka|कङ्क
कङ्क<BR> is the name of a bird, usually taken to mean ‘heron,’ 1) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 92. but, at any rate in some passages, rather denoting some bird of prey. 2) Roth. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 13. It first appears in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 4, 11, 1 (kaṅka-cit, an altar ‘piled in the form of a heron’); Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 31; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 12; Sāmaveda, ii. 9, 3, 6, 1 

kankata|कङ्कत
कङ्कत<BR> is the name of an animal mentioned once in the Rigveda. 1) i. 191, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98. According to Sāyaṇa it is a destructive beast; perhaps, as Grassmann renders it, a ‘scorpion.’

kankatiiya|कङ्कतीय
कङ्कतीय<BR> is the name of a family said in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) ix. 4, 4, 17. to have learned from Śāṇḍilya the piling up of the sacrificial firse (agni-cayana.) In the Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra 2) xiv. 20, 4. a Kaṅkati Brāhmaṇa, no doubt the textbook of the school, is referred to. It may have been identical with the Chāgaleya Brāhmaṇa, cited in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra. 3) xxv. 5. Cf. Caland, U7ber das vituclle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 40.

kankaparvan|कङ्कपर्वन्
कङ्क-पर्वन्<BR> (‘heron-jointed’?), a term occurring once in the Atharvaveda, 1) vii. 56, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 426; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 553; Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. is applied to a snake, meaning perhaps ‘scorpion.’ As the Paippalāda recension has a different reading (aṅga-parvaṇaḥ), the passage may be corrupt.

kaTa|कट
कट<BR> denotes a ‘mat,’ which was ‘made of reeds’ (vaitasa). The maker of mats from reeds (bidala-kārī) is mentioned in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 2) xxx. 8, with Mahīdhara's Commentary. Bidala-kāra is read in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 5, 1. and the process of splitting reeds for the purpose is referred to in the Atharvaveda. 3) vi. 138, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 255. ^1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā. v. 3, 12, 2. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 1, 3.

kaNTakiikaarii|कण्टकीकारी
कण्टकी-कारी,<BR> ‘worker in thorns,’ is one of the victims at the human sacrifice (Puruṣamedha) in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 1) xxx. 8. The Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 5, 1, has kaṇṭaka-kāra. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 255. No doubt the thorns were cut up and used to plait mats (Kaṭa) or to stuff cushions. 

kaNva|कण्व
कण्व<BR> is the name of an ancient Ṛṣi repeatedly referred to in the Rigveda and later. 1) Rv. i. 36, 8. 10. 11. 17. 19; 39, 7. 9; 47, 5; 112, 5; 117, 18; 118, 7; 139, 9; v. 41, 4; viii. 5, 23. 25; 7, 18; 8, 20; 49, 10; 50, 10; x. 71, 11; 115, 5; 150, 5; Av. iv. 37, 1; vii. 15, 1; xviii. 3, 15; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvii. 74; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, viii. 2, 2; ix. 2, 6; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxviii. 8, Kaṇvavat occurs in Rv. viii. 6, 11; 52, 8; Av. ii. 32, 3; Kaṇva-mant in Rv. viii. 2, 22. His sons and descendants, 2) As Kaṇvāḥ (in the plural), Rv. i. 14, 2. 5; 37, 1. 14; 44, 8; 46, 9; 47. 2. 4-10; 49, 4; viii. 2, 16; 3, 16; 4, 2. 3; 5, 4; 6, 3. 18. 21. 31. 34. 47; 7, 32; 8, 3; 9, 14; 32, 1; 33, 3; 34, 4; as Kaṇvasya sūnavaḥ, Rv. i, 45, 5; as putrāḥ, viii. 8, 4. 8; as Kāṇvāyanāḥ, viii. 55, 4. Kāṇva is found in viii. 1, 8; 2, 40; 4, 20; 7, 19; 9, 3, 9; 10, 2. the Kaṇvas, are also often mentioned, especially in the eighth book of the Rigveda, the authorship of that book, as well as of part of the first, being attributed to this family. A descendant of Kaṇva is also denoted by the name in the singular, either alone 3) Eg., Rv. i. 48, 4; viii. 34, 1, and probably elsewhere. or accompanied by a patronymic, as Kaṇva Nārṣada 4) Rv. i. 117, 8; Av. iv. 19, 2; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 150. and Kaṇva Śrāyasa, 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 4, 7, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxi. 8; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 3, 9. besides in the plural the Kaṇvas Sauśravasas. 6) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiii. 12. There is also Vatsa Kāṇva in Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 11, 20. The Kaṇva family appears to have been connected with the Atri family, 7) Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 214. but not to have been of great importance. 8) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 285. Cf. 1, 207, 438. In one passage of the Atharvaveda 9) Av. ii. 25. Cf. Vārttika on Pāṇini, iii. 1, 14; Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 2, 465; Hillebrandt, op. cit., 1, 207; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 110. Cf. Oldenberg, op. cit., 216 et seq.; Ludwig, op. cit., 3, 105. they seem to be definitely regarded with hostility.

kathaa|कथा
कथा<BR> --The later use of this word 1) Colebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays, 1, 293. in the sense of a ‘philosophical discussion’ appears in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 2) i. 8, 1: hantodgīthe kathāṃ vadāma, ‘let us begin a discussion regarding the Udgītha.’

kadruu|कद्रू
कद्रू,<BR> a word occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 45, 26. is interpreted by Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 162. as the name of a priest, but it more probably means a Soma vessel. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 

kanaknaka|कनक्नक
कनक्नक,<BR> a word occurring once in the Atharvaveda, 1) x. 4, 22. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 604; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 578. either denotes a poison or is an adjective qualifying kāṇḍā-viṣa, a species of poison.

kanaa|कना
कना, कन्या<BR> --Both these words, of which the former is very rare, 1) Rv. x. 61, 5, etc. while the latter is the normal term from the Rigveda 2) i. 123, 10; 161, 5; iii. 23, 10, etc.; Av. i. 14, 2; xi. 5, 18; xii, 1, 25, etc. onwards, denote ‘maiden’ or ‘young woman.’ It is doubtful whether Kanīnakā (accented on the final syllable) has this meaning, 3) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., cites in this sense Rv. iv. 32, 23; x. 40, 9; Nirukta, iv. 15; but neither of the Rv. passages is at all clear. or only denotes the pupil of the eye, 4) See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 401; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyāka, 207. Other rare forms are kanyanā, Rv. viii. 35, 5; kauyalā, Av. v. 5, 3; xiv. 2, 52. which is the sense of kanīnakā or kanīnikā (both accented on the antepenultimate) in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. See also Strī.

kapanaa|कपना
कपना,<BR> from its solitary occurrence in the Rigveda, 1) v. 54, 6. appears to mean a ‘worm’ that destroys the leaves of trees, and is so interpreted in the Nirukta. 2) vi. 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 97; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 330.

kaparda|कपर्द
कपर्द,<BR> ‘braid,’ Kapardin, ‘wearing braids.’ These words refer to the Vedic custom of wearing the hair in braids or plaits. Thus a maiden is said to have her hair in four plaits (catuṣ-kapardā), 1) Rv. x. 114, 3. and the goddess Sinīvālī is described as ‘wearing fair braids’ (su-kapardā). 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 56. Men also wore their hair in this style, for both Rudra 3) Rv. i. 114, 1. 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 10. 29. 43. 48. 59. and Pūṣan 4) Rv. vi. 55, 2; ix. 67. 11. are said to have done so, while the Vasiṣṭhas 5) Rv. vii. 33, 1. Cf. 83, 8. were distinguished by wearing their hair in a plait on the right (dakṣiṇatas-kaparda). The opposite was to wear one's hair ‘plain’ (pulasti). 6) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 43. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 264, 265; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, v. 462; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 424. See also Opaśa. 

kapi|कपि
1. Kapi, ‘monkey,’ occurs only once in the Rigveda 1) x. 86. 5. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 174; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 22 et seq.; von Schroeder, Mysterium und Mimus, 304 et seq.; Schirmeisen, Die Arischen Göttergestalten, 218 et seq.; Tilak, Orion, 170-197. with reference to Vṛṣā-kapi, the ‘Man-ape,’ in the dialogue of Indra and Indrāṇī in the presence of Vṛṣākapi. There the ape is termed the ‘tawny’ (harita). In the Atharvaveda 2) iii. 9, 4; iv. 32, 11; vi. 49, 1. Cf. also Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 6, 7 (kapy-āsa, ‘seat of an ape’). the monkey is mentioned several times as hairy, and an enemy of dogs. That the ape was tamed appears from its position in the Vṛṣākapi hymn, and from the mention, in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 3) iv. 2, 10, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 85, 86. of a Mayu as belonging to the forest. See also Mayu, Markaṭa, and Puruṣa Hastin.

kapi|कपि
2. Kapi is, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, another name for Luśa Khārgali in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (xxx. 2), but the name appears rather to be Luśākapi.

kapinjala|कपिञ्जल
कपिञ्जल,<BR> the name of the ‘francoline partridge’ or ‘hazelcock,’ is found in all the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 1, 1; v. 5, 16, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 10; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 20. 38. and occasionally later. 2) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 3; v. 5, 4, 4; xiii. 5, 1, 13; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 154, 2 (Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 181). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 91.

kapila|कपिल
कपिल<BR> appears in the Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 1) v. 2. as a teacher, according to Weber 2) Indische Studien, 1, 24 et seq.; 5, 412; Indian Literature, 236. and Garbe, 3) Sāṅkhya Philosophie, 27 et seq.; Translation of the Śāṅkhyatattvakaumudī, 531. who think that the expression kapila ṛṣiḥ there refers to the founder of the Sāṅkhya philosophy. But this is doubtful. 4) Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 2, xli, and Deussen, in his translation (Sechzig Upanishads, 304), do not take the word as a teacher's name. The latter renders kapila ṛṣiḥ, by ‘the red sage,’ as referring to Hiraṇyagarbha. 

kapivanabhauvaayana|कपिवनभौवायन
कपि-वन भौवायन<BR> is mentioned as a teacher in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 4, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxii. 2. and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 2) xx. 13, 4. A rite called Kapivana's Dvyaha (‘ceremony lasting two days’) is also referred to in the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra. 3) xxv. 2, 3. Cf. Āśvalāyana Srauta Sūtra, x. 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 24, 3, 473; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 55, n. 2; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 157.

kapota|कपोत
कपोत<BR> is the name of a bird, probably the ‘pigeon’ (its sense in the later language), occurring from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. i. 30, 4; Av. xx. 135, 12; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 23. 38. It is associated in some passages 2) Rv. x. 165, 1-5; Av. vi. 29, 2. with the owl (Ulūka) as a messenger of Nirṛti (‘dissolution,’ ‘misfortune’). This aspect of the pigeon as a bird of evil omen is probably based on an ancient belief which is also found beyond the confines of India. 3) Cf. Schrader, Prchistoric Antiquities, 253. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 89; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

kabandhaaatharvaNa|कबन्धआथर्वण
कबन्ध आथर्वण<BR> is mentioned in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1) vi. 7, 1. Cf. also Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 9. 18; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 176, n. 4; Weber, Indian Literature, 149. along with Sudhanvan Āṅgirasa, as a teacher, but is semi-mythical. His son was Vicārin Kābandhi.

kamadyuu|कमद्यू
कम-द्यू<BR> appears once in the Rigveda 1) x. 65, 12. as the wife of Vimada. She is probably identical with the ‘maiden’ (yoṣā) of Purumitra, no doubt his daughter. She is elsewhere 2) i. 117, 20; x. 39, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 310. referred to in connexion with Vimada, who appears to have taken her for his bride against the will of her father.

kambala|कम्बल
कम्बल<BR> denotes in the Atharvaveda 1) xiv. 2, 66. 67. Cf. Nirukta, ii. 2. a ‘woollen coverlet’ or ‘blanket.’ 

kamboja|कम्बोज
कम्बोज।--यास्क,<BR> in the Nirukta, 1) ii. 2. refers to the speech of the Kambojas as differing from that of the other Āryas. The Kambojas were later settled to the north-west of the Indus, and are known as Kambujiya in the old Persian inscriptions. A teacher, Kāmboja Aupamanyava, pupil of Madragāra, is mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 2) Indische Studien, 4, 372. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 102; Weber, Indische Streifen, 2, 493; 3, 384; Indische Studien, 10, 7; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 45; Max Müller, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 7, 373. On the relation of Indian and Iranian, see also Jacobi, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 721 et seq.; 1910, 457 et seq.; Oldenberg, ibid., 1095 et seq.; Keith, ibid., 1100 et seq.; Kennedy, ibid., 1107 et seq.; and see Parśu. This points to a possible connexion of the Madras, or more probably the Uttara Madras, with the Kambojas, who probably had Iranian as well as Indian affinities.

karanja|करञ्ज
करञ्ज,<BR> a word which in the Sūtras and later denotes the tree Pongamia glabra, occurs only twice in the Rigveda 1) i. 53, 8; x. 48, 8. as the name of a foe of Indra, but whether a demon or a man 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 63; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 149; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 292. is intended remains uncertain.

karambha|करम्भ
करम्भ<BR> is the name, from the Rigveda onwards, 1) Rv. i. 187, 16; iii. 52, 7; vi. 56, 1; 57, 2; viii. 102, 2; Av. iv. 7, 2. 3; vi. 16, 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 10, 2; vi. 5, 11, 4, etc. of a kind of porridge made of grain (Yava), which was unhusked, parched slightly, and kneaded. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 2, 14; iv. 2, 4, 18. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 317; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 395, n. 1. It was the especial sacrificial portion of Pūṣan, no doubt in his capacity of an agricultural deity. Karmabha was also made of barley (Upavāka) 3) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 22. or of sesame (Tirya). 4) Av. iv. 7, 3, but see Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 377; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 155. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 270. 

karikrata|करिक्रत
करिक्रत<BR> denotes, according to Zimmer, 1) Altindisches Leben, 95 a snake in the Atharvaveda. 2) x. 4, 13. The Paippalāda version has Kanikrada.

kariira|करीर
करीर,<BR> the name of a leafless shrub, Capparis aphylla, or its fruit, first appears in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 1) ii. 4, 9, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 11; xxxvi. 7; Śatapatha Brahmaṇa, ii. 5, 2, 11.

kariiSha|करीष
करीष<BR> denotes ‘dry cow dung’ in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) ii. 1, 1, 7. The Atharvaveda 2) Av. iii. 14, 3. 4; xix. 31, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236. shows that the value of the natural manure of animals in the fields was appreciated.

karkandhu|कर्कन्धु
1. Karkandhu is the ordinary word for ‘jujube,’ the tree (Zizyphus jujuba) and the fruit, from the Yajurveda Saṃhitās onwards. 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 10; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 23. 91; xxi. 32; xxiv. 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 4, 10; xii. 7, 2, 9; 9, 1, 5, etc.; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 156. 5. The berry is red (rohita). 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 242. Compare Kuvala and Badara, which denote the fruit.

karkandhu|कर्कन्धु
2. Karkandhu is only the name borne by a protégé of the Aśvins in the Rigveda (i. 112, 6). Its identity with the word for jujube indicates that the latter, though not otherwise mentioned there, was known at the time of the Rigveda.

karkari|कर्करि
कर्करि,<BR> a musical instrument, probably the ‘lute,’ occurs from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. ii. 43, 3; Av. iv. 37. 4. Cf. xx. 132. 3. 8. The Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 2) iv. 2, 9. Cf. Delbrück, Gurupūjākaumudī, 48, 49. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 289. mentions cattle branded on the ears with a mark resembling a lute (karkari-karṇyaḥ). 

karkii|कर्की
कर्की<BR> may denote in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 38, 6. 7. Cf. Bloomfield Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 414. a white cow,’ according to the suggestion of Roth. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary and Böhtlingk's Dictionary, s.v.

karNashobhana|कर्णशोभन
कर्ण-शोभन<BR> denotes an ‘ornament for the ear’ in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 78, 3. apparently for the use of men. Some deity is called ‘gold-eared’ in another passage of the Rigveda. 2) i. 122, 14. See also i. 64, 10. Hopkins 3) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 35. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 262. considers the use of ear-rings later than that of necklets and wristlets.

karNashravasaangirasa|कर्णश्रवसाङ्गिरस
कर्ण-श्रवस् आङ्गिरस<BR> is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 11, 14) as a seer of Sāmans or chants, the same tale being told of him as of Dāvasu.

karmaara|कर्मार
कर्मार,<BR> the ‘smith,’ is several times mentioned with approval in the Vedic Saṃhitās. 1) Rv. x. 72, 2; Av. iii. 5, 6; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 13; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 27; xxx. 7. Cf. karmāra, Rv. ix. 112, 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 3, 1. In the Atharvaveda 2) iii. 5, 6. The exact sense of the passage is doubtful. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 252; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 144; and Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 92, take the reference to be to ‘skilled chariot-makers’ (dhīvāno ratha-kārāḥ) and ‘clever smiths,’ but this is perhaps less likely. The commentator interprets dhīvānaḥ as ‘fishermen’ (in the later language dhīvara means both a ‘clever man’ and a ‘fisherman’). smiths appear with fishermen (dhīvānaḥ) and chariot-builders (rathakārāḥ), all being classified as clever workers (manīṣiṇaḥ): possibly a quasi-caste of smiths was already developing from the guild organization that probably existed. 3) Cf. Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 182. Little is known of the smith's methods of work and of his tools. No doubt he smelted (dhmā) the ore in the fire; hence he is called dhmātṛ, the ‘smelter.’ 4) Rv. v. 9. 5. Mention is also made of his bellows of birds' feathers. 5) Rv. ix. 112, 2. He made metal vessels (gharma ayasmaya) 6) Rv. v. 30, 15. to be put on the fire: even the Soma cup could occasionally be made of hammered metal (ayo-hata). 7) Rv. ix. 1, 2. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 252, 253; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 196 et seq.; U7ber den Rājasūya, 19 et seq.

karvara|कर्वर
कर्वर,<BR> a word found in one passage of the Atharvaveda. 1) x. 4, 19. seems to mean some kind of fish 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 96; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 578. caught by a fisherman (pauñjiṣṭha).

karShuu|कर्षू
कर्षू,<BR> a rare word found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) i. 8, 1, 3; xiii. 8, 3, 10. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 283. denotes a ‘furrow’ or ‘trench.’

kalavinka|कलविङ्क
कलविङ्क,<BR> a name of the ‘sparrow,’ is found in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 1, 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 10; Vājasaneyi Samhitā, xxiv. 20. 31. and occasionally later. 2) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 4; v. 5, 4, 5; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 154, 3 (Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 181). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 91.

kalasha|कलश
कलश<BR> is, from the Rigveda onwards, 1) Rv. i. 117, 12; iii. 32, 15; iv. 27, 5; 32, 19, etc.; Av. iii. 12, 7; ix. 1, 6; 4, 15; xviii. 4, 13, etc. In Rv. x. 32, 9, the word, according to the Śt. Petersburg Dictionary, is used as a proper name, but the passage is very doubtful. a common word for ‘pot’ or ‘jar,’ probably either formed of a gourd or made of clay (unburnt or baked), as we know that both kinds of pot were in use. 2) Av. iv. 17, 4; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 1, 8, 1; iv. 1, 5, 4; v. 1, 7, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 22; xi. 59. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 253; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 257; Oertel, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 185, n. 3; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 183 et seq. The wooden Soma tub (droṇa-kalaśa) is frequently referred to in the ritual. See also Kośa. 

kalaa|कला
कला<BR> denotes a fractional part, normally ‘one-sixteenth,’ in the Rigveda 1) viii. 47, 17. and later. 2) Av. vi. 96, 3; xix. 57, 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 10, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 7, 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 3, 1; xii. 8, 3, 13, etc.; Nirukta, xi. 12. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 278; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 259. It is often mentioned in connexion with Śapha, ‘one-eighth.’

kali|कलि
1. Kali. See Akṣa.

kali|कलि
2. Kali occurs in the Rigveda, twice in the singular 1) i. 112, 15; x. 39, 8. as the name of a protégé of the Aśvins, and once in the plural. 2) viii. 66, 15. The persons meant in the latter passage seem to be different from the former one. The Kalis are once mentioned in the Atharvaveda 3) x. 10, 13. beside the Gandharvas. 4) These Kalis may be connected with dicing, as in the Atharvaveda the Apsarases, the wives of the Gandharvas, are fond of dice, and bestow luck at play. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 135. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 89; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163.

kalpa|कल्प
कल्प<BR> in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (ii. 10) seems to denote Kalpa Sūtra.

kalmaaShagriiva|कल्माषग्रीव
कल्माष-ग्रीव<BR> (‘speckled-neck’) is the name of a snake in the Atharvaveda. 1) iii. 27, 5 (where the Paippalāda recension has kulmāṣa-); xii. 3, 59. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 10, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94, 95.

kalyaaNa|कल्याण
कल्याण<BR> is the name, in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 1) xii. 11, 10. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 68, n. 2. of an Āṅgirasa who saw the Aurṇāyava Sāman. 

kavacha|कवच
कवच<BR> denotes a ‘corselet’ or ‘breastplate’ in the Atharvaveda 1) Av. xi. 10, 22 (kavacin). and later. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2, 2, 7; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 19, 2; Nirukta, v. 25 (kavaca); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 1, 6, 3; 4, 1, 5; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 48; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 45 (kavacin). There is nothing to show whether it was made of metal, but that it was so is quite possible (see Varman). The Atharvaveda 3) xi. 10, 22. refers to a ‘corselet-strap’ (kavaca-pāśa), which may point to a linen corselet such as those known to Herodotus. 4) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 129, and Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 659, seem to recognize coats of mail only.

kavaSha|कवष
कवष<BR> is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 12. as one of those whom, together with the Druhyu king, Indra overthrew for the Tṛtsus. The Anukramaṇī (Index) also attributes to him the authorship of several hymns of the Rigveda, including two (x. 32. 33) that deal with a prince Kuruśravaṇa and his descendant Upamaśravas. There seems no reason to doubt this attribution, which is accepted by both Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 127. and Geldner. 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 150. The former holds that Kavaṣa was the Purohita of the joint tribes named Vaikarṇa, in whom he sees the KuruKrivi (Pañcāla) peoples, and that Kavaṣa in that capacity is mentioned in the Rigveda as representative of those peoples. He also suggests that the language of Rigveda x. 33, 4 is best explained by the reduced position in which the Kuru-Krivis found themselves on their defeat by the Tṛtsus. Ludwig, 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 139. on the other hand, thinks that Kavaṣa was the priest of the five peoples. Geldner 5) Loc. cit. holds that Kavaṣa was the Purohita of Kuruśravaṇa, by whose son, Upamaśravas, he was ill-treated, and that he composed Rigveda x. 33 to deprecate the anger of his royal master. Hopkins 6) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 261, 263. thinks that he was a king. In the Brāhmaṇas of the Rigveda 7) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 19; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xii. 1, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 459; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 386, 387; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 50. mention is made of Kavaṣa Ailūṣa, who was a Brāhmaṇa born of a female slave, and was reproached on this ground by the other Ṛṣis. He is possibly identical with the Kavaṣa of the Rigveda.

kasha|कश
कश<BR> is the name of an unknown animal mentioned as a victim at the horse sacrifice in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 17, 1; 18, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 26; 38. Cf. Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 84.

Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 84; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 57. suggests that the meaning is ‘pole-cat.’ Geldner 3) Rigveda, Glossar, 44. takes it as ‘female ichneumon.’

kashipu|कशिपु
कशिपु<BR> denotes a ‘mat’ or ‘cushion’ made, according to the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 138, 5. by women from reeds (naḍa), which they crushed for the purpose by means of stones. On the other hand, the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) xiii. 4, 3, 1. refers to a mat as made of gold.

कामलायन<BR> (‘descendant of Kamala’) is the patronymic of Upakosala in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (iv. 10, 1).

kaampiila|काम्पील
काम्पील<BR> --In one passage of the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 19, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 12, 20; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, Aśvamedha, iv. 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 18; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 9, 6; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2, 8, 3. the epithet Kāmpīla-vāsinī is applied to a woman, perhaps the king's Mahiṣī or chief wife, whose duty it was to sleep beside the slaughtered animal at the horse sacrifice (Aśvamedha). The exact interpretation of the passage is very uncertain, but both Weber 2) Indische Studien, 1, 184; Indian Literature, 114, 115. and Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 36, 37. So also Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 204; von Schroeder, Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 1, xxi; Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 164; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 321, 322. agree in regarding Kāmpīla as the name of the town known as Kāmpīlya in the later literature, and the capital of Pañcāla in Madhyadeśa.

kaari|कारि
कारि<BR> is the name of one of the victims of the human sacrifice (Puruṣamedha) in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 1) xxx. 6. 20; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 2, 1. and is there dedicated to ‘laughter.’ The commentator Mahīdhara 2) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit. interprets the word as ‘worker’ (karaṇa-śīla), but the St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests that it means a ‘jubilant’ person (as derived from the root kṛ, ‘to praise’).

kaariiradi|कारीरदि
कारीरदि<BR> is the name of persons mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (ii. 4, 4) as holding a special view of the Udgītha (Sāmaveda Chant).

kaaru|कारु
कारु,<BR> ‘poet,’ is a word almost confined to the Rigveda. 1) i. 148, 2; 165, 12; 177, 5; 178, 3; ii. 43, 1; iii. 33, 8; 39, 7; v. 33, 7; vii. 27; 68, 9; 72, 4, etc.: Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 8, 7; Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 21. There is evidence that the poet was regarded as a professional man, just as much as the physician (Bhiṣaj). 2) ix. 112. 3. The poets, no doubt, mainly lived at the courts of princes amid their retainers, 3) vii. 73. 1. though they would probably also sing the praises of rich merchants. There was probably no essential connexion between the priest and the poet. Though the priest was often a poet, yet poetry can hardly have been restricted to the priestly caste. Indeed, at the horse sacrifice (Aśvamedha) the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 4) xiii. 1, 5, 1; 4, 3, 5. expressly requires that one of the singers of panegyrics should be a Rājanya, while the other was a Brāhmaṇa, both singing verses of their own composition. The Anukramaṇī (Index) in several cases 5) E.g., x. 92 is attributed to Śāryāta Mānava. attributes hymns of the Rigveda to princes; and even though this may often be merely the same sort of procedure 6) See Pischel, Vedische Studien, 3, 202. as has made Śūdraka the author of the Mṛcchakaṭikā, or Harṣa of the Ratnāvalī, and has given us royal teachers of the Brahman doctrine, 7) Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 20, n. 4, sees in Av. xx. a recension of Kṣatriya character. He also finds Kṣatriyas in Viśvāmitra and Kakṣīvant, but hardly with reason. Cf. Varṇa. still the Indian tradition evidently saw nothing odd in the idea of nonBrāhmaṇas as poets. Most of the non-sacred poetry has, however, disappeared, for the epic is a product, as it stands, of a later period. See also Ṛṣi.

kaarotara|कारोतर
कारोतर<BR> appears to denote in the Rigveda, 1) i. 116, 7. and occasionally later, 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 16, 82; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 9, 1, 2; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 280. a ‘filter’ or ‘sieve’ for purifying the liquor called Surā.

kaarotii|कारोती
कारोती<BR> is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ix. 5, 2, 15) as a place, or perhaps a river, where Tura Kāvaṣeya made a fire-altar--that is, as a seat of the fire-cult par excellence.

kaarShman|कार्ष्मन्
कार्ष्मन्,<BR> a word meaning literally ‘furrow,’ and found only in the Rigveda, 1) i. 116, 17; ix. 36, 1; 74, 8. is the designation of the goal in the chariot race. The competitor probably turned round it and came back to the starting-place. 2) Av. ii. 14, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 291, 292.

kaarShmarya|कार्ष्मर्य
कार्ष्मर्य<BR> is the name of a tree (Gmelina arborea) which is often alluded to in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 1) v. 2, 7, 3. 4; vi. 2, 1, 5. the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 2) iii. 2, 6; 7, 9. and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 3) iii. 4, 1, 6; 8, 2, 17; iv. 3, 3, 6; vii. 4, 1, 37. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62. 

kaala|काल
काल,<BR> the generic expression for ‘time,’ first occurs in the Rigveda, 1) x. 42, 9. where, however, it is used only once, in the late tenth book. It is known to the Atharvaveda, 2) xix. 53. 54. where Kāla has already developed the sense of time as fate. The word is frequent in the Brāhmaṇas, 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 3, 3; ii. 4, 2, 4; iii. 8, 3, 36; vii. 2, 2, 21, etc. superseding the earlier use of Ṛtu. The more general division of time is into ‘past’ (bhūta), ‘present’ (bhavat), and ‘future’ (bhaviṣyat). 4) E.g., Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, vii. 20. For other divisons see Ahan, Māsa, Saṃvatsara.

kaalakaa|कालका
कालका<BR> is the name of one of the victims at the horse sacrifice (Aśvamedha) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 15, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 16; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 35. variously identified with a bird 2) Mahīdhara on Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit. or a chameleon. 3) Sāyaṇa on Taittirīya Saṃhitā, loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99.

kaalakaanja|कालकाञ्ज
काल-काञ्ज<BR> --In the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 80, 2. mention is made of the Kālakāñjas as being in the sky. Both Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 353. hold that some constellation is meant. But as the defeat of the Kālakāñjas is one of Indra's exploits, 4) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, viii. 1, Cf. also Maitrāyanī Saṃhitā, i. 6, 9; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 4-6; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iii, 1. it is doubtful whether any stress can be laid on that interpretation of the passage in the Atharvaveda. Whitney 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 341. suggests that the three stars of Orion are meant, Bloomfield 6) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 500; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 163-169. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 410, 414 et seq.; 3, 465; Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 121. that the galaxy or the stars in general are intended. 

kaavaSheya|कावषेय

The Kāvaṣeyas are also mentioned as teachers of philosophical points in the Rigveda Āraṇyakas. 1) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 2, 6; Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, viii. 11. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 391, n.; 2, 418; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 257.

In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa it is also applied to Iḍhat 2) xiv. 9, 16. and Ukṣṇorandhra. 3) xiii. 9, 19. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 48, 49.

kaasha|काश
काश<BR> --Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. finds this word, which denotes a species of grass (Saccharum spontaneum) used for mats, etc., in one passage of the Rigveda, 2) x. 100, 10. but the reading is uncertain. The word has this sense in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka. 3) vi. 9, 1.

kaashi|काशि
काशि, काश्य<BR> --The name Kāśi denotes (in the plural 1) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 19. 21. The plural occurs also in the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda, v. 22, 14.) the people of Kāśi (Benares), and Kāśya, the king of Kāśi. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) xiii. 5, 4, 19. tells of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, king of Kāśi, who was defeated by Śatānīka Sātrājita, with the result that the Kāśis, down to the time of the Brāhmaṇa, gave up the kindling of the sacred fire. Sātrājita was a Bharata. We hear also of Ajātaśatru as a king of Kāśi; 3) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 1, 1; iii. 8, 2; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv. 1. and no doubt Bhadrasena Ajātaśatrava, a contemporary of Uddālaka, was also a king of Kāśi. The Kāśis and Videhas were closely connected, as was natural in view of their geographical position. The compound name Kāśi-Videha occurs in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad; 4) Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, loc. cit. in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5) iii. 8, 2. Gārgī describes Ajātaśatru as either a Kāśi or a Videha king. The Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 6) xvi. 29, 5. mentions one Purohita as acting for the kings of Kāśi, Kosala, and Videha; and the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 7) xxi. 13. mentions Kāśi and Videha in close proximity. Weber, 8) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 212, 213. indeed, throws out the suggestion that the Kāśis and the Videhas together constitute the Uśīnaras, whose name is very rare in Vedic literature. As Kosala and Videha were in close connexion, Kāśi and Kosala are found combined in the compound name KāśiKauśalyas of the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa. 9) i. 2, 9. Though Kāśi is a late word, it is quite possible that the town is older, as the river Varaṇāvatī referred to in the Atharvaveda 10) iv. 7. 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 20; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 376. may be connected with the later Vārāṇasī (Benares). It is significant that while the Kāśis, Kosalas, and Videhas were united, any relations which the Kuru-Pañcala peoples may have had with them were hostile. It is a fair conclusion that between these two great groups of peoples there did exist some political conflict as well as probably a difference of culture in some degree. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 11) i. 4, 1, 10 et seq. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 170 et seq.; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xlii et seq., 104, n. 1. in the story of the advance of Āryan civilization over Kosala and Videha, preserves a clear tradition of this time, and a piece of evidence that in the Kuru-Pañcāla country lay the real centre of the Brāhmaṇa culture (see also Kuru-Pañcāla). That the Kosala-Videhas were originally settlers of older date than the Kuru-Pañcālas is reasonably obvious from their geographical position, but the true Brāhmaṇa culture appears to have been brought to them from the Kuru-Pañcala country. It is very probable that the East was less Āryan than the West, and that it was less completely reduced under Brahmin spiritual supremacy, as the movement of Buddhism was Eastern, and the Buddhist texts 12) See Fick, Die seciale Gliederung, chap. iv. reveal a position in which the Kṣatriyas rank above Brāhmaṇas. With this agrees the fact that the later Vedic texts 13) Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, xxii. 4, 22; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 6, 28. See Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 99; Fick, op. cit., 140, n. 1; and of. Magadha. display towards the people of Magadha a marked antipathy, which may be reasonably explained by that people's lack of orthodoxy, and which may perhaps be traced as far back as the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 14) xxx. 5. 22. See Magadha. It is, of course, possible that the Kosala-Videhas and Kāśis actually were merely offshoots of the tribes later known as the Kuru-Pañcālas, and that they by reason of distance and less complete subjugation of the aborigines lost their Brahminical culture. This hypothesis, however, appears less likely, though it might be supported by a literal interpretation of the legend of the Aryan migration in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 15) Cf. Eggeling, loc. cit., 104, n. 1. Cf. Grierson, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 837, 1143; Keith, ibid., 831, 1138; Oldenberg, Buddha, 402 et seq.

kaasyapa|कास्यप
कास्यप<BR> (‘descendant of Kaśyapa’) is a common patronymic, 1) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 5, 1, 5; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 18; x. 1, 8, etc. and is applied specially to Ṛśyaśṛṅga, Devataras Śyāvasāyana, Śūṣa Vāhneya.

kaashyapiibaalaakyaamaaThariiputra|काश्यपीबालाक्यामाठरीपुत्र
काश्यपी-बालाक्या-माठरी-पुत्र<BR> (‘son of Kāśyapī, Bālākyā, and Māṭharī’). This curious name is given in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1) vi. 4, 31 (Mādhyaṃdina recension). to a teacher, pupil of Kautsīputra.

kaaShaayaNa|काषायण
काषायण<BR> is mentioned in the second Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad as a teacher, pupil of Sāyakāyana according to the Kāṇva (iv. 6, 2), of Saukarāyaṇa according to the Mādhyaṃdina recension (iv. 5, 27).

kaaShThaa|काष्ठा
काष्ठा<BR> seems to have the sense in the Rigveda 1) i. 37, 10; 65, 3; iv. 58, 7; vi. 46, 1; vii. 93, 3; viii. 80, 8; ix. 21, 7. of ‘course’ for a chariot race. It also means in the Rigveda 2) x. 102, 9, is perhaps so to be taken. and later 3) Av. ii. 14, 6: Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 9, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ix. 13; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 7; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 7, 2. etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 291, 292; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 77. ‘goal,’ either like the Kārṣman the turning place, or the final goal (paramā kāṣṭhā). 

kaas|कास्
कास्, कास, कासा, कासिका<BR> --All these four forms 1) Kās: Av. i. 12, 3; v. 22, 10; Kāsa: Av. v. 22, 11 (probably); Kāsā: Av. vi. 105, 1 et seq.; Kāsikā: Av, v. 22, 12; xi. 2, 22. of the same word denote ‘cough,’ which is mentioned in the Atharvaveda as accompanying a headache, 2) Av. i. 12, 3. as a symptom in fever (Takman), 3) v. 22, 10. and as an independent disease. 4) vi. 105. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 385; Grohmann, Indische Studien, 9, 394; Jolly, Medicin, 89.

kaahoDi|काहोडि
काहोडि<BR> (‘descendant of Kahoḍa’) is the patronymic of Argala in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (xxv. 5).

kiMshuka|किंशुक
किंशुक<BR> is the name of a tree (Butea frondosa) mentioned in the wedding hymn of the Rigveda, 1) x. 85, 20. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62. Sāyaṇa thinks the meaning is that the car is made of the wood of the tree. the bridal car being described as adorned with its blossoms (su-kiṃśuka).

kikidiivi|किकिदीवि
किकि-दीवि<BR> denotes some kind of bird, perhaps the blue jay. 1) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. See Rv. x. 97, 13. According to the commentator, it means ‘partridge’ (tittiri) in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 2) v. 6, 22, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 92; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 251.

kitava|कितव
कितव,<BR> ‘the gambler,’ is frequently referred to in the Rigveda 1) ii. 29, 5; v. 85, 8; x. 34, 3. 7. 10. 11. 13. and later. 2) Av. vii. 50, 1; 109, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 8. 18. 22; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 19, etc. A father is represented as chastising his son for gambling. 3) Rv. ii. 29, 5. Cf. Pitṛ. The gambler seems at times to have fallen, along with his family, into servitude, presumably by selling himself to pay his debts. 4) Rv. x. 34. Cf. perhaps the bhaktadāsa, ‘slave for hire,’ of the Mānava Dharma Sāstra, viii. 415; Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 197. Technical names 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 3, 1 et seq.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 18. for different sorts of gamblers given in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās are Ādinava-darśa, Kalpin, Adhi-kalpin, and Sabhā-sthāṇu. None of these can be safely 6) Cf. Weber, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 18, 282; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 284. explained, though the last has usually 7) So Mahīdhara on Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 18; Sāyaṇa on Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 16, 1. been taken as a satirical name derived from the gambler's devotion to the dicing place (Sabhā), ‘pillar of the dicing hall.’ The first literally means ‘seeing ill-luck,’ 8) Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Weber, loc. cit. and may refer to the quickness of the dicer to note an error on the part of his antagonist, or to his eagerness to see the defeat of his rival.

kiMpuruSha|kimpuruSha|किंपुरुष|किम्पुरुष
किं-पुरुष,<BR> lit. ‘what sort of man,’ appears in the Brāhmaṇas 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 8; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 3, 9; vii. 5, 2, 32. to designate the ‘ape,’ which is a mimic man. Possibly the same sense should be seen in the passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 2) xxx. 16; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 12, 1. where it occurs, and where Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. assumes it to refer to a contemptible man. Max Müller 4) Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 420. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 246; Omina und Portenta, 356; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 51, n. 3. renders it ‘savage.’

kiyaambu|कियाम्बु
कियाम्बु<BR> is the name of one of the water-plants which are to grow, according to a funeral hymn in the Rigveda, 1) x. 16, 13 = Av. xviii. 3, 6. on the place where the body of the dead was burned. The word seems to mean ‘having some water,’ possibly by popular etymology. 2) Cf. Sāyaṇa on Rv., loc. cit., and on Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, vi. 4, 1, 2, where Kyāmbu is the form. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62; Bloomfield, Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, October, 1890, xl.

kiraata|किरात
1. Kirāta is a name applied to a people living in the caves of the mountains, as appears clearly from the dedication of the Kirāta to the caves (guhā) in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 1) xxx. 16; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 12, 1. and from the reference in the Atharvaveda 2) x. 4, 14. to a Kirāta girl (kairātikā), who digs a remedy on the ridges of the mountains. Later 3) Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 530, 534. the people called Kirātas were located in Eastern Nepal, but the name seems to have been applied to any hill folk, no doubt aborigines, though the Mānava Dharma Śāstra 4) x. 44. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 32; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 207; V. Smith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Socicty, 1909, 258, n. 1; Lévi, Le Népal, 2, 77. regards them as degraded Kṣatriyas.

kiraata|किरात
2. Kirāta.<BR> --In the story of Asamāti there appear, as the two priests who are opposed to the Gaupāyanas, Kirāta and Akuli according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 1) xiii. 12, 5 (where the text reads kirāta-kulyau). Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v., takes the word, with Sāyaṇa, as an adjective, kirāta-kula, ‘of the family of Kirāta.’ The reading in the Bṛhaddevatā (vii. 86) is kirātākulī. or Kilāta and Ākuli according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 2) i. 1, 4, 14 (where the text reads kilātākulī). Cf. also Sāṭyāyanaka Brāhmaṇa apud Sāyaṇa on Rv. x. 57, 1; 60, 1; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 167; Journal of the American Oriental Socicty, 18, 41 et seq.; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 48, n. 1. No doubt the name is chosen, not as that of a historic person, but as a suitable designation of a hostile priest; for it is probably identical with the name of the mountaineers described in the preceding article.

kilaata|किलात
किलात<BR> is the form of the name 2. Kirāta that appears in the Śatapatha, Śāṭyāyanaka, and Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇas. 1) See note^2 under the preceding article.

kilaasa|किलास
किलास<BR> is the name of a disease, ‘white leprosy,’ in the Atharvaveda 1) i. 23, 24. and the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, etc. 2) xxx. 21; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 3, 17; xxiii. 11, 11; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, v. 4, 12. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 391; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 266; Jolly, Medicin, 98; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 68. It resulted in the appearance of grey (palita) and white (śukla, śveta) spots all over the skin. Haug gave the same sense to alasa in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 3) vi. 33, 5. but this is doubtful. The fem. Kilāsī is taken by Max Müller to mean a ‘spotted deer’ in one passage of the Rigveda. 4) v. 53, 1. 

kiikaTa|कीकट
कीकट<BR> --The name of this people occurs only in one passage of the Rigveda, where they appear as hostile to the singer and as under the leadership of Pramaganda. Yāska 2) Nirukta, vi. 32. declares that Kīkaṭa was the name of a non-Āryan country, and later 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Kīkaṭa is given as a synonym of Magadha. Hence Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 31, 118. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 58. concludes that the Kīkaṭas were a non-Āryan people living in the country later known as Magadha. Weber 5) Indische Studien, 1, 186; Indian Literature, 79, n. *. holds that this people were located in Magadha, but were Āryan, though at variance with other Āryan tribes, perhaps because of heretical tendencies, for Magadha was later a seat of Buddhism. But the identification is uncertain, and is doubted by Oldenberg 6) Buddha, 402, 403; Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 253. and Hillebrandt. 7) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 14-18. ^1 iii. 53, 14.

kiiTa|कीट
कीट<BR> is the name of a species of worm mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 1) ix. 4, 16. and frequently in the Upaniṣads. 2) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 19; 2, 14; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 9. 3; 10, 2; vii. 2, 1; 7, 1; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, i. 2, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

kiinaasha|कीनाश
कीनाश,<BR> a name of the ploughman or cultivator of the soil, is found in the Rigveda 1) iv. 57, 8. and the later Saṃhitās. 2) Av. iv. 11, 10; vi. 30, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 11; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 8, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 237; Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 45; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 86, n. See Kṛṣi.

kiiri|कीरि
कीरि<BR> is in the Rigveda 1) i. 31, 13; ii. 12, 6; v. 52, 12 (kīriṇaḥ; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 317). But see Geldner. Rigveda, Glossar, 46; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 223. a regular designation of the ‘poet.’ Cf. Ṛṣi.

kiirshaa|कीर्शा
कीर्शा,<BR> the name of some kind of animal, or perhaps bird, is mentioned in the list of victims for the horse sacrifice (Aśvamedha) in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 1) v. 5, 20, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 

kiilaala|कीलाल
कीलाल,<BR> a word denoting a ‘sweet drink,’ is found in all the later Saṃhitās, 1) Av. iv. 11, 10; 26, 6; 27, 5; vi. 69, 1; x. 6, 25; xii. 1, 59; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 12, 13; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 7, 12; iii. 11, 3. 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ii. 34; iii. 43; xx. 65; xxx. 11, etc. but not in the Rigveda. As the Surā-kāra, ‘maker of Surā,’ is dedicated in the list of victims in the human sacrifice 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 11; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 9, 1. (Puruṣamedha) to Kīlāla, it must have been a drink of somewhat the same nature as the Surā itself, possibly, as Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 281. suggests, a kind of rum.

kiishmiila|कीश्मील
कीश्मील<BR> denotes, according to Böhtlingk, 1) Dictionary, s.v. a certain disease in the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda. 2) xix. 8, 4.

kiista|कीस्त
कीस्त<BR> in two passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 127, 7; vi. 67, 10. Cf. Yāska, Nirukta, iii. 15. means ‘poet,’ like Kīri.

kukkuTa|कुक्कुट
कुक्कुट,<BR> ‘cock,’ occurs in the Yajurveda 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 16. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 91. only. 2) It is common in the later language.

kuTaru|कुटरु
कुटरु<BR> is, according to the commentator Mahīdhara, 1) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv, 23. synonymous with Kukkuṭa, ‘cock.’ The word is found in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās only. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 17, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 1, 6; iii. 14, 4. 20; iv. 1, 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 23, 39. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93.

kuNDapaayin|कुण्डपायिन्
कुण्ड-पायिन्<BR> (‘drinking from a jug’) is the name of a teacher mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) xxv. 4, 4. and in the Sūtras. 2) Āśvalāyana Srauta Sūtra, xii. 4, 6; Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, xxiv. 4, 21. 

kuNDapaayya|कुण्डपाय्य
कुण्ड-पाय्य<BR> (‘descendant of Kuṇḍapāyin’) is a patronymic connected with a man named Śṛṅgavṛṣ in one passage of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 17, 13. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 161; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 90.

kuNDRNaachii|कुण्डृणाची
कुण्डृणाची<BR> is the name of an animal of unknown character occurring in the lists of victims at the horse sacrifice (Aśvamedha) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 16, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 18; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 37. The word also occurs in one passage of the Rigveda, 2) i. 29, 6. in which a bird would seem to be intended, though Sāyaṇa interprets it as meaning ‘with crooked flight’ (kuṭila-gatyā). In his commentary on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 3) v. 5, 16, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 89. he takes the word to denote the houselizard (gṛha-godhikā).

kutsa|कुत्स
कुत्स<BR> is the name of a hero frequently mentioned in the Rigveda, which, however, gives practically no information about him, for he was no doubt already a figure of the mythic past. He is several times 1) Rv. iv. 26, 1; vii. 19, 2; viii. 1, 11. called Ārjuneya, ‘descendant of Arjuna,’ and is usually 2) Rv. i. 63, 3; 121, 19; 174, 5; 175, 4; iv. 30, 4; v. 29, 4; vi. 20, 5; vii. 19, 2; x. 99, 9. associated with Indra in the exploit of defeating the demon Śuṣṇa and winning the sun. He is said 3) Rv. x. 49, 4. to have defeated Smadibha, Tugra, and the Vetasus, but, on the other hand, he is several times 4) Rv. i. 53, 10; ii. 14, 7; viii. 53, 2. Cf. iv. 26, 1. mentioned with Atithigva and Āyu as being vanquished by Indra, his defeat in one passage 5) Rv. i. 53, 10. being attributed to Tūrvayāṇa. Elsewhere 6) Rv. i. 51, 6; vi. 26, 3. he appears with Atithigva as a friend of Indra's. In the later literature he is seldom 7) E.g., Av. iv. 29, 5; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 11, 26. mentioned except in connexion with the myth of his binding Indra, which is found in the Brāhmaṇas, 8) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ix. 2, 22; Śāṭyāyanaka in Sāyaṇa on Rv. x. 38, 5; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 228; Oertel. Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 31. and which is based on an obscure verse in the Rigveda. 9) x. 38, 5. The Kutsas, or descendants of Kutsa, are mentioned in one hymn of the Rigveda. 10) vii. 25, 5. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 113, 148; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 210, 211; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 284 et seq., who suggests that perhaps two Kutsas--one a friend of Indra, and the other a foe --may be distinguished; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 171; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 57, n. 1.

kutsaaurava|कुत्सऔरव
कुत्स औरव<BR> (‘son of Uru’) is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) xiv. 6, 8. as having murdered his domestic priest (purohita), Upagu Sauśravasa, because the father of the latter insisted on paying homage to Indra. This fact may be compared with the hostility to Indra of Kutsa according to certain passages of the Rigveda. 2) See Kutsa. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 284; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 57; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 32.

kunti|कुन्ति
कुन्ति<BR> --The Kuntis are referred to in an obscure and corrupt passage of the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 1) xxvi. 9. See Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 471, and cf. perhaps Maitrāyaṇī aṃhitā, iv. 2, 6. as having defeated the Pañcālas.

kuberavaarakya|कुबेरवारक्य
कुबेर वारक्य<BR> is mentioned in a list of teachers in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 41, 1) as a pupil of Jayanta Vārakya.

kubhaa|कुभा
कुभा<BR> is the name of a river mentioned twice in the Rigveda, 1) v. 53, 9; x. 75. 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200. and no doubt identical with the modern Kabul river, the Greek .

kubhra|कुभ्र
कुभ्र<BR> is the name of some animal in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (ii. 5, 3). 

kumuda|कुमुद
कु-मुद<BR> is the name of a plant mentioned with other water plants in one passage of the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 34. 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70. It is no doubt the white water-lily (Nymphœa esculenta), being the name of that plant in post-Vedic Sanskrit also.

kumba|कुम्ब
कुम्ब<BR> is mentioned with Opaśa and Kurīra as an ornament of women's hair in the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 138, 3. Geldner 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 131. thinks that, like those two words, it originally meant ‘horn,’ but this is very doubtful. Indian tradition 3) Sāyaṇa on Av. vi. 138, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 265; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 538, 539; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 348; Caland, U7ber das vituclle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 59. simply regards the term as denoting a female adornment connected with the dressing of the hair.

kumbyaa|कुम्ब्या
कुम्ब्या<BR> or Kumvyā is a word mentioned after Ṛc, Yajus, Sāman, and Gāthā in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xi. 5, 7, 10. to denote a form of speech. In the Aitareya Āraṇyaka 2) ii. 3, 6. it appears as one of the forms of measured speech together with Ṛc and Gāthā. The precise meaning of the term is unknown. Weber 3) Indische Studien, 10, 111, n. Cf. Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 221; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44. 101. suggests the sense ‘refrain.’

kumbha|कुम्भ
कुम्भ<BR> is a word of frequent occurrence in the Rigveda, 1) i. 116, 7; 117, 6; vii. 33, 13, etc. as well as later, 2) Av. i. 6, 4; iii. 12, 7, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 87, etc. and denotes a ‘pot.’ Usually no doubt made of clay, it was easily broken. 3) Rv. x. 89, 7. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 367. See also Ukhā.

kumbhiinasa|कुम्भीनस
कुम्भी-नस<BR> (‘pot-nosed’) is the name of an animal mentioned in the list of victims at the horse sacrifice (Aśvamedha) in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 1) v. 5, 14, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s. v. Possibly some sort of snake is meant, as in the later literature. 

kuyavaach|कुयवाच्
कुय-वाच्<BR> (‘evil-speaking’) appears in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 174, 7. to denote a demon slain by Indra, probably as a personification of the barbarian opponents of the Āryans. The expression mṛdhra-vāc (‘speaking insultingly’) is similarly used of barbarians in the Rigveda. 2) v. 29, 10; 32, 8. See Dasyu.

kuriira|कुरीर
कुरीर,<BR> like Opaśa and Kumba, denotes some sort of female head ornament in the description of the bride's adornment in the wedding hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 85. 8. and in the Atharvaveda. 2) vi. 138, 3. According to the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 5, 3: Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 7. 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 56. the goddess Sinīvālī is described by the epithets su-kapardā, su-kurīra, sv-opaśā, as wearing a beautiful head-dress. According to Geldner, 4) Vedische Studien, 1, 131, 132. the word originally meant ‘horn’; but this is uncertain, as this sense is not required in any passage in which the term occurs. 5) Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 21 (= vaitāna Sūtra, xi. 22), cited by Geldner, is quite vague. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 265; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharanaveda, 539; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 348; Caland, U7ber das vituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 59.

kuriirin|कुरीरिन्
कुरीरिन्<BR> (‘having a Kurīra’) is a word occurring in an ambiguous passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) v. 31, 2. in which it may be taken either as a noun meaning a ‘crested animal,’ perhaps as Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 91. suggests the ‘peacock,’ or as an epithet of the word Aja, ‘goat,’ in which case it might mean ‘horned.’ But even in the latter alternative a metaphorical application of the word seems sufficient, just as in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 3) xiii. 4, 3. Opaśa is used of the horns of cattle, and thus renders unnecessary the adoption of Geldner's 4) Vedische Studien, 1, 130. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 457, 539; Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 285; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 279. view that the original meaning of Kurīra is ‘horn.’ 

kuru|कुरु
कुरु<BR> --The Kurus appear as by far the most important people in the Brāhmaṇa literature. There is clear evidence that it was in the country of the Kurus, or the allied KuruPañcālas, that the great Brāhmaṇas were composed. 1) For the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 49, 50, with Weber, Indian Literature, 67, 68; for the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa and the Śāṅkhāyana Brāhmaṇa, Weber, loc. cit., 45; for the Aitareya and Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyakas, Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 387; for the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, Weber, loc. cit., 132, Transactions of the Bcrlin Academy, 1895, 859. The Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa refers repeatedly to the Kuru-Pañcālas, whose name also occurs in the late and confused Gopatha Brāhmaṇa. For the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, see i. 8, 4, 1. 2, and for the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 6. The Kurus are comparatively seldom mentioned alone, their name being usually coupled with that of the Pañcālas on account of the intimate connexion of the two peoples. The Kuru-Pañcālas are often expressly referred to as a united nation. 2) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, 6; 8, 7; iv. 7, 2; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv. 1; Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, 1. 2, 9; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 3, 3 (Kāṇva recension). In the land of the Kuru-Pañcālas speech is said to have its particular home; 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 3, 15. the mode of sacrifice among the Kuru-Pañcālas is proclaimed to be the best; 4) Ibid., i. 7, 2, 8; cf. Kuru-vājapeya in Sāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 3, 15; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 11, 18. the Kuru-Pañcāla kings perform the Rājasūya or royal sacrifice; 5) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 2, 3. 5. their princes march forth on raids in the dewy season, and return in the hot season. 6) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 1. 8, 4. 1, 2. Later on the Kuru-Pañcāla Brahmins are famous in the Upaniṣads. 7) Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 78; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 30, 6; iv. 6, 2; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 1, 1; 9, 20, etc. Weber 8) Indische Studien, 3, 470; Indian Literature, 114. and Grierson 9) Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 602-607; 837-844. have sought to find traces in Vedic literature of a breach between the two tribes, the latter scholar seeing therein a confirmation of the theory that the Kurus belonged to the later stream of immigrants into India, who were specially Brahminical, as opposed to the Pañcālas, who were anti-Brahminical. In support of this view, Weber refers to the story in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 10) x. 6. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xli. of a dispute between Vaka Dālbhya and Dhṛtarāṣṭra Vaicitravīrya, the former being held to be by origin a Pañcāla, while the latter is held to be a Kuru. But there is no trace of a quarrel between Kurus and Pañcālas in the passage in question, which merely preserves the record of a dispute on a ritual matter between a priest and a prince: the same passage refers to the Naimiṣīya sacrifice among the Kuru-Pañcālas, and emphasizes the close connexion of the two peoples. 11) See Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 831-836; 11381142. Secondly, Weber conjectures in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 12) xxiii. 18. that Subhadrikā of Kāmpila was the chief queen of the king of a tribe living in the neighbourhood of the clan, for whose king the horse sacrifice described in the Saṃhitā was performed. But the interpretation of this passage by Weber is open to grave doubt; 13) Eggeling. Sacred Books of the East, 44, 322. and in the Kāṇva recension of the Saṃhitā 14) xi. 3, 3. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 114, note *. a passage used at the Rājasūya shows that the Kuru-Pañcālas had actually one king. Moreover, there is the evidence of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 15) xiii. 5, 4, 7. that the old name of the Pañcālas was Krivi. This word looks very like a variant of Kuru, and Zimmer 16) Altindisches Leben, 103. plausibly conjectures that the Kurus and Krivis formed the Vaikarṇa 17) vii. 18, 11. of the Rigveda, especially as both peoples are found about the Sindhu and the Asiknī. 18) Keith, loc. cit., 835. The Kurus alone are chiefly mentioned in connexion with the locality which they occupied, Kurukṣetra, We are told, however, of a domestic priest (Purohita) in the service of both the Kurus and the Sṛñjayas, 19) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 4, 5. who must therefore at one time have been closely connected. 20) Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 123. In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad reference is made to the Kurus being saved by a mare (aśvā), 21) iv. 17, 9: for aśvā Böhtlingk in his edition reads akṣṇā, followed by Little, Grammatical Index, 1. and to some disaster which befel them owing to a hailstorm. 22) i. 10, 1. In the Sūtras, again, a ceremony (Vājapeya) of the Kurus is mentioned. 23) Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 3, 15. There also a curse, which was pronounced on them and led to their being driven from Kurukṣetra, is alluded to. 24) Ibid., xv. 16, 11. Cf. Weber, Indian Literathre, 136. This possibly adumbrates the misfortunes of the Kauravas in the epic tradition. In the Rigveda the Kurus do not appear under that name as a people. But mention is made of a prince, Kuruśravaṇa (‘Glory of the Kurus’), 25) Rv. x. 33, 4. and of a Pākasthāman Kaurayāṇa. 26) Rv. viii. 3, 21. In the Atharvaveda 27) xx. 127, 7 et seq.; Khila, v. 10. there occurs as a king of the Kurus Parikṣit, whose son, Janamejaya, is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 28) xiii. 5, 4. as one of the great performers of the horse sacrifice. It is a probable conjecture of Oldenberg's 29) Buddha, 403, 404. that the Kuru people, as known later, included some of the tribes referred to by other names in the Rigveda. Kuruśravaṇa, shown by his name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the Rigveda called Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ who is well known as a king of the Pūrus. Moreover, it is likely that the TṛtsuBharatas, who appear in the Rigveda as enemies of the Pūtus, later coalesced with them to form the Kuru people. 30) Ibid., 406-409. Since the Bharatas appear so prominently in the Brāhmaṇa texts as a great people of the past, while the later literature ignores them in its list of nations, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that they became merged in some other tribe. Moreover, there is evidence that the Bharatas occupied the territory in which the Kurus were later found. Two of them are spoken of in a hymn of the Rigveda 31) iii. 23. as having kindled fire on the Dṛṣadvatī, the Āpayā, and the Sarasvatī--that is to say, in the sacred places of the later Kurukṣetra. Similarly, the goddess Bhāratī (‘belonging to the Bharatas’) is constantly mentioned in the Āprī (‘propitiatory’) hymns together with Sarasvatī. 32) Cf. Scheftelowitz, Die Apokṛyphen des Ṛgveda, 145. Again, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, one Bharata king was victorious over the Kāśis, 33) xiii. 5, 4, 11. and another made offerings to Gaṅgā and Yamunā, 34) Ibid., 21. while raids of the Bharatas against the Satvants are mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 35) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 25 (cf. Haug's edition, 2, 128, n. 3); Oldenberg, Buddha, 407, note*. Nor is it without importance that the Bharatas appear as a variant for the Kuru Pañcālas in a passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 36) xi. 3, 3. See note 14; Oldenberg, Buddha, 408, 409. and that in the list of the great performers of the horse sacrifice the names of one Kuru and two Bharata princes are given without any mention of the people over which they ruled, while in other cases that information is specifically given. 37) Oldenberg, 409, note*. The territory of the Kuru-Pañcālas is declared in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa to be the middle country (Madhyadeśa). 38) viii. 14. Cf. Oldenberg, 392, 393. A group of the Kuru people still remained further north--the Uttara Kurus beyond the Himālaya. It appears from a passage of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa that the speech of the Northerners-that is, presumably, the Northern Kurus--and of the KuruPañcālas was similar, and regarded as specially pure. 39) iii. 2, 3, 15. This is the sense which it appears to bear, as the KuruPañcālas can bardly be reckoned as being northerly (Oldenberg, 395), and the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, vii. 6 (Indische Studien, 2, 309) in independent evidence for the puro speech of the north. Cf. Eggeeling Sacred Books of the East, 12. xiii. Weber, Indian Literature, 45; Indische Studien, 1, 191. There seems little doubt that the Brahminical culture was developed in the country of the Kuru-Pañcālas, and that it spread thence east, south, and west. Traces of this are seen in the Vrātya Stomas (sacrifices for the admission of non-Brahminical Āryans) of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 40) xvii. 1, 1. See also Av. xv. with Whitney's and Lanman notes; Weber, Ind the Studien, 1, 33 et seq.; Indian Literature, 67, 78, 80. and in the fact that in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka it is unusual for a Brahmin to dwell in the territory of Magadha. 41) vii. 13. Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 400, note*; Weber, Indian Literature, 112, n. 126. The repeated mention of KuruPañcāla Brahmins is another indication of their missionary activity. 42) See e.g. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 4, 1, 2, and note 6. The geographical position of the Kuru-Pañcālas renders it probable that they were later immigrants into India than the Kosala-Videha or the Kāśis, 43) This is recognized, e.g., by Oldenberg, Buddha, 9, 391, 398, 399; Lanman, Sanskrit Keader, 297, etc. The narrative of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 1, 10 et seq. (Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 170), rather implies that the KosalaVidehas are offshoots of the KuruPañcālas, but Oldenberg and Macdonell (Sanskrit Literature, 214 interpret this as referring to the spread of Vedic tradition and culture, not of nationality. who must have been pushed into their more eastward territories by a new wave of Āryan settlers from the west. But there is no evidence in Vedic literature to show in what relation of time the immigration of the latter peoples stood to that of their neighbours on the west. It has, however, been conjectured, 44) Cf. Grierson, Languages of India, 52 et seq.; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 837 et seq. On the other hand, it is probably an error to assume that the Bharatas were originally situated far west of Kurukṣetra, and that the main action of the Rigveda was confined to the Panjab. When Vasiṣṭha celebrates the crossing of the Vipāś and Śutudrī (Rv. iii. 33), he probably came from the east, as Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 218, points out, and not from the west. Adopting the ordinary view, Hopkins, India, Old and New, 52, finds it necessary to suggest that Yamunā is only another name in the Rv. for the Paruṣṇī. But the necessity for this suggestion, which is not in itself plausible, disappears when it is realized that the Bharatas held a territory roughly corresponding to Kurukṣetra, and bounded on the east by the Yamunā. On the other hand, Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 142, 143. places the Kurus near the Ārjīkīyā in Kaśmīr, which puts them too far north. So also Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 103, and Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xlii. It seems probable that the Kurus were at a very early period widely scattered to the north of the Himālaya, in Kurukṣetra, and about the Sindhu and Asiknī. Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 400 et seq.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 152-157; von Schroeder, Indiens Literature und Cultur, 164 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 187 et seq.; Indian Literature, 114, 135, 136; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 27; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 333 et seq.; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 205, n. mainly on the ground of later linguistic phenomena, which have no cogency for the Vedic period, that the Kurus were later immigrants, who, coming by a new route, thrust themselves between the original Āryan tribes which were already in occupation of the country from east to west. Cf. also Kṛtvan. For other Kuru princes see Kauravya.

kuruxetra|कुरुक्षेत्र
कुरु-क्षेत्र<BR> (‘land of the Kurus’) is always regarded in the Brāhmaṇa texts 1) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 5, 13; xi. 5, 1, 4; xiv. 1, 1, 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 30; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 4; iv. 5, 9; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 126 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, cxlvi); Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 16, 11, etc. as a particularly sacred country. Within its boundaries flowed the rivers Dṛṣadvatī and Sarasvatī, as well as the Āpayā. 2) Cf. Rv. iii. 23; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 218. Here, too, was situated Śaryaṇāvant, 3) See Pischel, loc. cit., and cf. Ārjīkīyā. which appears to have been a lake, like that known to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa by the name of Anyataḥ-plakṣā. 4) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 1, 4. According to Pischel, there was also in Kurukṣetra a stream called Pastyā, 5) Pischel, loc. cit., 219. which he sees in certain passages of the Rigveda. The boundaries of Kurukṣetra are given in a passage of the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 6) v. 1, 1. These places cannot be further identified. See also Mara. Cf. von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 164, 165; Max Mūller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 398, 399; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 78, 79; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 174. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xli., seems to place Kurukṣetra, as lying between the Yamunā and Gaṅgā, too far east. as being Khāṇḍava on the south, the Tūrghna on the north, and the Parīṇah on the west. Roughly speaking, it corresponded to the modern Sirhind.

kurunga|कुरुङ्ग
कुरुङ्ग<BR> is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) viii. 4, 19; Nirukta, vi. 22. as a prince and a patron. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160. suggests that he was a king of the Anus, but for this theory there seems no good ground. As the Turvaśas are mentioned in the same verse, he may possibly have been one of their kings. The name suggests a connexion with the Kurus, and it may be noted that in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3) xi. 5, 4, 16. See Oldenberg, Buddha, 404. the Turvaśas are connected with the Pañcālas (Krivis).

kuru|कुरु
कुरु<BR> -śravaṇa Trāsadasyava is alluded to as dead in a hymn of the Rigveda, 1) x. 33, 4. Cf. Bṛhaddevatā, vii. 35, 36. which refers also to his son Upamaśravas, and his father Mitrātithi. In another hymn 2) x. 32, 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165: Geldner, Vediscke Studien, 2, 150, 184; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 386. he is mentioned as still alive. His name connects him on the one hand with the Kurus, and on the other with Trasadasyu and the Pūrus.

kuruuru|कुरूरु
कुरूरु,<BR> apparently the name of a species of worm, is mentioned twice in the Atharvaveda. 1) ii. 31, 2; ix. 2, 22. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98. 

kurkura|कुर्कुर
कुर्कुर<BR> is an onomatopoetic name for the dog in the Atharvaveda. 1) vii. 95, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 233. See also Śvan.

kula|कुल
कुल, कुल-पा<BR> --As an uncompounded word, Kula does not occur before the period of the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 22; ii. 1, 4, 4; 4, 1, 14; xi. 5, 3, 11; 8, 1, 3; xiii. 4, 2, 17; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 5, 32; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iii., 13, 6, etc. It denotes the ‘home’ or ‘house of the family,’ and by metonymy the family itself, as connected with the home. The Kula-pā (lit. ‘house protector’), or chief of the family, is mentioned in the Rigveda 2) x. 179, 2. as inferior to and attendant on the Vrājapati in war, the latter being perhaps the leader of the village contingent of the clan. In the Atharvaveda 3) i. 14, 3. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 15; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Athcrvaveda, 252, correcting Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 314. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 162. a girl is ironically called Kulapā, because she is left without a husband in the world, and has only Yama (the god of death) for a spouse. The use of the term Kula points clearly to a system of individual families, each no doubt consisting of several members under the headship of the father or eldest brother, whose Kula the dwelling is. As distinct from Gotra, Kula seems to mean the family in the narrower sense of the members who still live in one house, the undivided family. Cf. Gṛha, Grāma, Jana, Viś.

kulaala|कुलाल
कुलाल,<BR> the word denoting a ‘potter,’ occurs in the Śatarudriya, or litany to Rudra in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 27. Cf. kulāla-kṛta, ‘made by a potter,’ Maitrāyaṇi Saṃhitā, i. 8. 3, and Kaulāla.

kulisha|कुलिश
कुलिश,<BR> ‘axe,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda as used for the making of chariots, 1) iii. 2, 1. and also in warfare, 2) i. 32. 5. while the Atharvaveda refers to its employment in cutting down trees. 3) ii. 12, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 252. 

kuliikaya|कुलीकय
कुलीकय<BR> is the form in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) v. 5, 13, 1. of the name of an animal, apparently a kind of fish, as explained by Mahīdhara in his commentary, which is called Kulīpaya in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 2) xxiv. 21. 35. and Purīkaya in the Atharvaveda, 3) xi. 2, 25. The commentator reads Pulīkaya, as in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 2. See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 624. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 96. variants probably due to the faulty tradition of an unfamiliar. name.

kuliikaa|कुलीका
कुलीका<BR> is the name of a bird mentioned in the list of victims at the horse sacrifice in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 1) xxiv. 24. The Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 2) iii. 14, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94. has Pulīkā instead.

kulunga|कुलुङ्ग
कुलुङ्ग<BR> is the name of an animal, perhaps a gazelle, mentioned in the list of victims at the horse sacrifice in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 11, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 9, 13 (with the variant Kulaṅga); Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 27. 32. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83.

kulmala|कुल्मल
कुल्मल<BR> seems, in the Atharvaveda, 1) iv. 6, 5; v. 18, 15. the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 2) iii. 8, 1. 2. and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 3) iii. 4, 4, 14. to denote the neck of an arrow in which the shaft is fixed.

kumalabarhis|कुमलबर्हिस्
कुमल-बर्हिस्<BR> is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xv. 3, 21) as the seer of a Sāman or Chant.

kumaarahaarita|कुमारहारित
कुमार हारित<BR> is mentioned in the first Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1) ii. 5, 22 (Mādhyaṃdina = ii. 6, 3, Kāṇva). as a pupil of Gālava.

kulmaaSha|कुल्माष
कुल्माष,<BR> a word mentioned by the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1) i. 10, 2. 7. in the plural, is interpreted by the commentator as ‘bad beans’ (kutsitā māṣāḥ), a version adopted by Böhtlingk in his Dictionary. 2) Cf. Bhāgavata Purāṇa, v. 9. 12. where it is glossed ‘worm-eaten beans.’ Little 3) Grammatical Index, 52. renders it ‘sour gruel’ in accordance with the Nirukta. 4) i. 4.

kulyaa|कुल्या
कुल्या<BR> in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) iii. 45, 3; x. 43, 7. according to Muir, 2) Sanskrit Texts, 5, 465, 466. possibly refers to artificial watercourses flowing into a reservoir (hrada). See Avata.

kuvaya|कुवय
कुवय<BR> See Kvayi.

kuvala|कुवल
कुवल<BR> is a name of the jujube fruit (Zizyphus jujuba) occurring frequently in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 22, 89; xxi. 29; Kāthaka Saṃhitā, xii. 10. and Brāhmaṇas 2) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 4, 10; xii. 7, 1, 2; 2, 9; 9, 1, 5, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 242. in connexion with Karkandhu and Badara. See also Kola.

kusha|कुश
कुश,<BR> a word later denoting the ‘sacred grass’ (Poa cynosuroides), is taken by the St. Petersburg Dictionary to mean simply ‘grass’ in the passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa in which it occurs. ^1) ii. 5, 2, 15; iii. 1, 2, 16; v. 3, 2, 7, etc. Kuśā and Kuśī occur in Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 6, 2, 9; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 10, 1. 2, 7, apparently denoting pins of wood or metal, used as a mark in a special mode of recitation.

kusara|कुसर
कु-सर<BR> is mentioned with Śara and other grasses in one hymn of the Rigveda 1) i. 191, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72. as affording lurking places for serpents.

kushika|कुशिक
कुशिक<BR> is the probably mythical forefather 1) Nirukta, ii. 25. of the Kuśikas, and especially the father of the most important member of that family, Viśvāmitra. 2) Rv. iii. 33, 5. The Kuśikas are repeatedly referred to in the third Maṇḍala of the Rigveda, 3) iii. 26, 1; 29, 15; 30, 20; 33, 5; 42, 9; 50, 4; 53, 9. 10. and figure in the legend of Śunaḥśepa in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 4) vii. 18; Sāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xv. 27. They were clearly a family of priests who attached themselves to the service of the princes of the Bharatas. They were especially devoted to the worship of Indra; hence he is styled Kauśika even in the Rigveda. 5) i. 10, 11, with Sāyaṇa's note. Cf. Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 4, 19; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, i. 12, 4; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 62, 63. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, i, 38; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 342 et seq.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 101, 121; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 155; Oldenberg. Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 209.

kushrivaajashravasa|कुश्रिवाजश्रवस
कुश्रि वाज-श्रवस<BR> appears as a teacher concerned with the lore of the sacred fire in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) x. 5, 5. 1. and in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2) vi. 4, 33 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 5, 3, Kāṇva). he is mentioned as a pupil of Vājaśravas. It is not clear whether he is identical with the Kuśri of the last Vaṃśa of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 3) vi. 5, 4 (Kāṇva only). in the Kāṇva recension, and of the Vaṃśa in the tenth book of the Śatapatha, 4) x. 6, 5, 9. In the Vaṃśas the name is accented Kúśri, but in x. 5, 5, 1, as Kuśrī; no stress can, however, be laid on this. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 70; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xxxiii. who is mentioned as a pupil of Yajñavacas Rājastambāyana.

kuShaNDa|कुषण्ड
कु-षण्ड<BR> is mentioned with Ṣaṇḍa as a priest at the snake festival described in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 34; Lāṭyāyana Śranta Sūtra, x. 20, 10.

kuShiitaka|कुषीतक
1. Kuṣītaka denotes, according to the commentary on the one passage of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) v. 5, 13. 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72. in which it is found, the sea crow (samudra-kāka)

kuShiitakasaamashravasa|कुषीतकसामश्रवस
2. Kuṣītaka Sāma-śravasa is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) xvii. 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 34. as the Gṛhapati, or householder at a sacrificial session, of the Kauṣītakis. 

kuShumbhaka|कुषुम्भक
कुषुम्भक<BR> seems in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 191, 16. The sense of ‘poisonbag’ is possible in i. 191, 15, and is accepted there by Böhtlingk in his Dictionary. to mean a poisonous insect, Kuṣumbha in th Atharvaveda 2) ii. 32, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 257. clearly having the sense of a poison bag. Sāyaṇa renders it as ‘ichneumon’ (nakula).

kuShTha|कुष्ठ
1. Kuṣṭha is the name of a plant (Costus speciosus or arabicus) 1) Or Saussurea auriculata, Hillebreandt. Vedische Mythologie, 1, 65. which is prominent in the Atharvaveda. 2) v. 4; vi. 102; xix. 139. It grew especially on the mountains, along with the Soma, on the high peaks of the Himālaya (Himavant) where the eagles nest, and was thence brought east to men. 3) v. 4, 1. 2. 8; xix. 39, 1. Like Soma, it is said to have grown in the third heaven under the famous Aśvattha tree, where the gods were wont to assemble, and thence it was brought in a golden ship. 4) v. 4, 3-6; vi. 75, 1. 2; xix. 39, 6-8. As a remedy, it held the highest place among herbs, being called by the auspicious names Nagha-māra and Naghā-riṣa, and styled the offspring of Jīvala and Jīvalā, the ‘lively’ ones. 5) v. 4, 1; xix. 39, 4. It cured headache (śīrṣāmaya), diseases of the eyes, bodily affliction, 6) v. 4, 10. but especially fever--hence called ‘feverdestroyer’ (takma-nāśana)--and consumption (Yakṣma). From its general properties it was also named ‘all-healing’ (viśvabheṣaja). 7) xix. 39, 9. Its aromatic qualities were apparently known, as it is classed with ‘salve’ (Āñjana) and ‘nard’ (Nalada). 8) vi. 102, 3. Cf. Grohmann, Indische, Studien, 9, 420 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 63, 64; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 415, 680; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 227, 228.

kuShTha|कुष्ठ
2. Kuṣṭha.<BR> --In one passage of the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 1) iii. 7, 7. Cf. Bōhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. there is a series of fractions, Kalā, Kuṣṭha, Śapha, Pad, which appear to denote one-sixteenth, one-twelfth, one-eighth, and one-fourth respectively. 

kusiidin|कुसीदिन्
कुसीदिन्<BR> is a designation of the ‘usurer’ found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 4, 3, 11. and the Nirukta, 2) vi. 32. and often in the Sūtras. Jolly, 3) Recht und Sitle, 98, 99. referring doubtless to the expression kusīda apratītta, 4) iii. 3, 8, 1. 2. ‘a loan not yet repaid,’ occurring in connexion with an-ṛṇa, ‘free from debt,’ appears to be right in taking Kusīda to have the sense of ‘loan’ in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. The rate of interest on loans is not specified before the Sūtra period. 5) E.g., Gautama Sūtra, xii. 29 et seq. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 259. Cf. Ṛṇa.

kusurubindaauddalaki|कुसुरुबिन्दऔद्दलकि
कुसुरुबिन्द औद्दलकि<BR> appears as an authority on ritual matters in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 1) xxii. 15, 1. 10. the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 2) vii. 2, 2, 1. the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, 3) i. 75 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 23, 327), where the reading seems to be Asurbinda. and the Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 4) i. 16. See Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 39. The name is there read as Kusurubindu; in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 22, 14 it is Kusurabindu. He may have been the brother of Śvetaketu, as suggested by Weber. 5) Indische Studien, 5, 61, n.

kuhuu|कुहू
कुहू<BR> See Māsa.

kuuchakra|कूचक्र
कूचक्र<BR> is a word occurring only once in an obscure verse of the Rigveda, 1) x. 102, 11. where Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 157. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 14. suggests that it has the sense of the wheel by which water is raised from a well. Much more probable is the interpretation of Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. who understands it to mean the female breast.

kuuTa|कूट
कूट,<BR> a word found in the Rigveda, 1) x. 102, 4. the Atharvaveda, 2) viii. 8, 16. and the Brāhmaṇas, 3) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 24; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 1, 15; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 49, 9; 50, 2 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 114). is of doubtful signification. On the whole, the most probable sense is hammer, 4) So Bloomfield, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 546; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 585. which suits every passage adequately. The St. Petersburg Dictionary renders it ‘horn,’ which is the sense accepted by Whitney 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 505. for the Atharvaveda passage where it occurs. Geldner 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 138; 2, 7. Cf. von Bradke, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 46, 458; Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 34, 156; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 222. thinks that it means ‘trap.’

kuudii|कूदी
कूदी,<BR> written also Kūṭī in the manuscripts, occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 19, 12. and the Kauśika Sūtra 2) Bloomfield's edition, xliv. Cf. Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 11, 355; 12, 416; Roth, Festgrnss an Böhtlingk, 98; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 254; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 165. denoting a twig--identified by the scholiast with Badarī, the jujube--which was tied to the bodies of the dead to efface their traces, presumably in order to render the return of the spirit to the old home difficult.

kuupa|कूप
कूप<BR> occurs in the Rigveda 1) i. 105, 17. and later literature 2) Av. v. 31, 8; Satapatha Brahmaṇa, iii. 5, 4, 1; iv. 4, 5, 3; vi. 3, 3. 26, etc.; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 184. etc. The adjective kūpya, ‘being in a hole,’ occurs frequently in the later Saṃhitās. denoting an artificial hollow in the earth, or pit. In some cases they must have been deep, as Trita in the myth is said to have fallen into one from which he could not escape unaided. 3) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 67.

kuubara|कूबर
कूबर<BR> in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (ii. 1, 11) and Kūbarī in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (iv. 6, 9, 11. 12) and the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (xxvii. 6) denote the pole of a cart.

kuurcha|कूर्च
कूर्च<BR> is found in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) vii. 5, 8, 5. and later 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 3, 4. 7; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 11, 1; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v, 1, 4. denoting a bundle of grass used as a seat. In one passage of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3) xiii. 4, 3, 1. a golden Kūrca is referred to. 

kuurma|कूर्म
कूर्म,<BR> the ‘tortoise,’ is mentioned frequently in the later Saṃhitās 1) Av. ix. 4, 16; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 3, 3; v. 2, 8, 4. 5; 7, 13, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 15, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 34, etc. and Brāhmaṇas, 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 2, 3; vi. 1, 1, 12, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 153. but nothing is said of its characteristics. See also Kaśyapa.

kuushaambasvaayavalaatavya|कूशाम्बस्वायवलातव्य
कूशाम्ब स्वायव लातव्य<BR> is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) viii. 6, 8. as a priest. His name apparently means 2) The form is peculiar, as Kuśāmba would be expected. Kūśāmba, 3) Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 55, n. 2. of the Lātavya clan, son of Svāyu.

kRkalaasa|कृकलास
कृकलास<BR> denotes the ‘chameleon’ mentioned in the list of sacrificial victims at the horse sacrifice in the Yajurveda 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 19, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 21; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 40. and later. 2) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 5, 22. The female chameleon, Kṛkalāsī, is also referred to in the Brāhmaṇas. 3) Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 221 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 29), Sāṭyāyanaka in Sāyaṇa on Rv. viii. 91. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95. See Godhā and Śayaṇḍaka.

kRkavaaku|कृकवाकु
कृक-वाकु,<BR> the ‘cock,’ being named in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 31, 2. Cf. x. 136, 10. with sheep, goats, and other domesticated animals, was presumably tamed. 2) Cf., however, Sāyaṇa on Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 18, 1, who says that it is a ‘forest’ Kukkuṭa. In the list of victims at the horse sacrifice in the Yajurveda, 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, loc. cit.; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 15; Vājasaneyi; Saṃhitā, xxiv. 35. it appears as dedicated to Savitṛ: Yāska 4) Nirukta, xii. 3. explains this by the fact that it declares the time of day (kālānuvāda). The commentator Mahīdhara 5) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit. explains the name by tāmra-cūḍa, ‘red-crested.’ It is of course onomatopoetic (‘calling kṛka’). 6) Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 251; Weber, Indische Studien, 18. 285. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 91. See also Kukkuṭa. 

kRta|कृत
कृत<BR> See 2. Akṣa and 2. Yuga.

kRti|कृति
कृति<BR> --From one passage in the Rigveda, 1) i. 168, 3. where the Maruts are described as having Kṛtis, Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 301. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 221. concludes that the word means a dagger used in war. But there is no evidence that Kṛti was ever a human weapon. See Asi.

kRttikaas|कृत्तिकास्
कृत्तिकास्<BR> See Nakṣatra.

kRtvan|कृत्वन्
कृत्वन्<BR> --In one passage of the Rigveda 1) ix. 65, 23. the word Kṛtvan in the plural is mentioned with the Ārjīkas and the five peoples. Pischel 2) Vedische Studien, 2, 209. thinks that it means a people, and Sāyaṇa expressly says that the Kṛtvans designate a country. 3) Kṛtvāna iti deśābhidhānam. The name in that case would point to some connexion with the Kurus or Krivis. Hillebrandt, 4) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 136, 137 however, thinks that the word is an adjective which qualifies Ārjīkas and designates this people as magicians, being applied to them by an opponent. In favour of this view, he quotes Hiouen Thsang's statement 5) Cunningham, Aneient Gevgraphy of India, 93. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. that the neighbouring kings held the base Kaśmīrians in such scorn as to refuse all alliance with them, and to give them the name of Ki-li-to, or Kṛtyas. He suggests that the Ārjīkas settled in Kasmīr in ancient times already had the same evil reputation as their successors in later days.

kRpa|कृप
कृप<BR> is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 3, 12; 4, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. along with Ruśama and Śyāvaka, as a protégé of Indra.

kRmi|कृमि
कृमि,<BR> ‘worm.’ In the later Saṃhitās, 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 11, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 11; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 30; Mantra Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iv. 36; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 1, 2; and of. Rv. i. 191. and especially in the Atharvaveda, 2) ii. 31. 32; v. 23. worms play a considerable part. They are regarded as poisonous, and are spoken of as found in the mountains, in forests, in waters, in plants, and in the human body. In accordance with widespread primitive ideas, they are considered to be the causes of disease in men and animals. The Atharvaveda contains three hymns 2) ii. 31, 32; v. 23. as charms directed against them. The first of these hymns is of a general character, the second is meant to destroy worms in cattle, and the third is intended to cure children of worms. When found in men, worms are said to have their place in the head and ribs, 3) Av. ii. 31, 4. and to creep into the eyes, nose, and teeth. 4) Av. v. 23, 3. They are described as dark brown, but white in the fore part of the body, with black ears, and as having three heads. 5) Av. v. 23, 4 et seq. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98, 393; Kuhn, Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung, 13, 49 et seq.; 113 et seq.; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 313 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 199; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 73. They are given many specific names: Alāṇḍu, Ejatka, Kaṣkaṣa, Kīṭa, Kurūru, Nīlaṅgu, Yevāṣa, Vaghā, Vṛkṣasarpī, Śaluna, Śavarta, Śipavitnuka, Stega.

kRmuka|कृमुक
कृमुक<BR> is the name in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 1) xix. 10. and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) vi. 6, 2, 11. of a species of wood used for fuel. 3) Ibid. (Krāmuha as applied to samidh).

kRsha|कृश
कृश<BR> is mentioned with Saṃvarta as a pious sacrificer to Indra in one of the Vālakhilya hymns of the Rigveda 1) viii. 54, 2. and in another 2) viii. 59, 3. as a speaker of truth, while a third is traditionally 3) Indische Studien, 1, 293, n. ascribed to his authorship. He seems also to be mentioned with Śayu as a protégé of the Aśvins in another hymn of the Rigveda, 4) x. 40, 8. but here the word may merely denote the ‘feeble man.’ 5) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 132, 164. 

kRshana|कृशन
कृशन,<BR> ‘pearl.’ In the Rigveda pearls are mentioned as adorning the car of Savitṛ 1) i. 35, 4. as well as being used for the adornment of a horse. 2) x. 68, 1. Hence the horse is spoken of as the ‘pearled one’ (kṛśanāvant). 3) i. 126, 4. Cf. kṛśanin, vii. 18, 23. The Atharvaveda 4) x. 1, 7. also refers to pearls, and mentions that ‘pearl shell’ (śañkhaḥ kṛśanaḥ) won from the sea was used as an amulet. 5) iv. 10, 1. 3. The Nighaṇṭu 6) i. 2. Cf. Sāma Mantra Brāhmaṇa, 1, 6, 22. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben,, 53, 54; Lanman in Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 161. renders the word as ‘gold.’

kRshaanu|कृशानु
कृशानु<BR> appears in the Rigveda as a mythological personage. 1) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 74, 112, 137; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 448. In one verse, 2) i. 112, 21. however, Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 4. sees in this word the name of a bowman, but there seems no reason to dissociate this passage from the rest.

kRShi|कृषि
कृषि,<BR> ‘ploughing.’ The cultivation of the soil was no doubt known to the Indians before they separated from the Iranians, as is indicated by the identity of the expressions yavaṃ kṛṣ and sasya in the Rigveda with yao karesh and hahya in the Avesta, referring to the ploughing in of the seed and to the grain which resulted. 1) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 235; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 85. But it is not without significance that the expressions for ploughing occur mainly in the first 2) Forms of the root kṛṣ, ‘to plough,’ occur in Rv. i. 23, 15; 176, 2. and tenth 3) Rv. x. 34, 13; 117, 7. In x. 146, 6, akṛṣīvala, ‘not agricultural,’ occurs. Cf. x. 101, 4. books of the Rigveda, and only rarely in the so-called ‘family’ books (ii.-vii.). 4) Kṛṣ is also found in viii. 20, 19; 22, 6; in the family books only in iv. 57, 4, and as vi-kṛṣ in iv. 57, 8. In the Atharvaveda Pṛthī Vainya is credited with the origination of ploughing, 5) viii. 10, 24. and even in the Rigveda the Aśvins are spoken of as concerned with the sowing of grain by means of the plough. 6) i. 117, 21. In the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas ploughing is repeatedly referred to. 7) Kṛṣi is found, e.g., in Av. ii. 4, 5; viii. 2, 19; 10, 24; x. 6, 12; xii. 2, 27, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 11; 1, etc.; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 2, 2; iii. 6, 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iv. 10; ix. 27; xiv. 19. 21, etc.; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 2, 2, 7; viii. 6, 2, 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 2, 5, etc. In Av. vi. 116, 1, kārṣīvaṇa denotes a ‘plougher.’ See also Kārṣman. Even in the Rigveda 8) x. 34, 13; 117, 7. Cf. Hopkins, India, Old and New, 208. there is clear proof of the importance attached to agriculture. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 9) xvii. 1. the Vrātyas, Hindus without the pale of Brahminism, are described as not cultivating the soil. The plough land was called Urvarā or Kṣetra; manure (Śakan, Karīṣa) was used, and irrigation was practised (Khanitra). The plough (Lāṅgala, Sīra) was drawn by oxen, teams of six, eight, or even twelve being employed. 10) Av. vi. 91, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 2. Cf. Rv. viii. 6, 48; x. 101, 4. The operations of agriculture are neatly summed up in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11) i. 6, 1, 3. as ‘ploughing, sowing, reaping, and threshing’ (kṛṣantaḥ, vapantaḥ, lunantaḥ, mṛṇantaḥ). The ripe grain was cut with a sickle (Dātra, Sṛṇi), bound into bundles 12) viii. 78, 10; x. 101, 3; 131, 2. (Parṣa), and beaten out on the floor of the granary (Khala). 13) Rv. x. 48, 7. The grain was then separated from the straw and refuse either by a sieve (Titau) or a winnowing fan (Śūrpa). 14) Rv. x. 71, 2; Av. xii. 3, 19. The technical terms are tuṣair vi-vic, Av. xi. 1, 12; palāvān apa-vic, xii. 3, 19. The winnower was called Dhānyākṛt, 15) Rv. x. 94, 13. and the grain was measured in a vessel called Urdara. 16) Rv. ii. 14, 11. See also Sthivi. The Rigveda leaves us in doubt as to the kind of grain grown, for Yava is a word of doubtful signification, and Dhānā is also vague. In the later Saṃhitās 17) See Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 12, for a list. things are different. Rice (Vrīhi) appears, Yava means barley, with a species styled Upavāka. Beans (Mudga, Māṣa), sesamum (Tila), and other grains (Aṇu, Khalva, Godhūma, Nīvāra, Priyaṅgu, Masūra, Śyāmāka) are mentioned, while cucumbers (Urvārū, Uryārūka) were known. It is uncertain whether fruit trees (Vṛkṣa) were cultivated, or merely grew wild; 18) The pulling of ripe fruit is referred to in Rv. iii. 45, 4. Cf. pakvā śākhā, Rv. i. 8, 8; vṛkṣa pakva, Rv. iv. 20, 5; Av. xx. 127, 4. But that does not prove arboriculture. but frequent mention is made of the jujube (Karkandhu, Kuvala, Badara.). The seasons for agriculture are briefly summed up in a passage of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā: 19) vii. 2, 10, 2. barley ripened in summer, being no doubt sown, as in modern India, in winter; rice ripened in autumn, being sown in the beginning of the rains; beans and sesamum, planted at the time of the summer rains, ripened in the winter and the cool season. There were two harvests (Sasya) a year according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā; 20) v. 1, 7, 3. the winter crop was ripe by the month of Caitra (March-April) according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa. 21) xix. 3. Cf. Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 81, n. 1. The farmer had plenty of trouble of his own: moles destroyed the seed, birds and various kinds of reptiles (Upakvasa, Jabhya, Tarda, Pataṅga) injured the young shoots, excessive rain or drought might damage the crops. The Atharvaveda contains spells to prevent these evils. 22) See Av. vi. 50. 142; vii. 11. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 235243.

kRShTi|कृष्टि
कृष्टि<BR> denotes ‘people’ in general from the Rigveda 1) i. 52, 11; 100, 10; 160, 5; 189, 3; iii. 49, 1; iv. 21, 2, etc.; Av. xii. 1, 3. 4. onwards. Its common and regular use in this sense appears to show that the Āryans, when they invaded India, were already agriculturists, though the employment of the words referring to ploughing mentioned under Kṛṣi indicates that not all of the people devoted themselves equally to that occupation. Indra and Agni are par excellence the lords of men (Kṛṣṭi). 2) i. 177, 1; iv. 17, 5; vii. 26, 5; viii. 13, 9 (Indra); i. 59, 5; vi. 18, 2; vii. 5, 5 (Agni). Sometimes the word is further defined by the addition of an adjective meaning ‘belonging to mankind,’ ‘of men’ (mānuṣīḥ, 3) Rv. i. 59, 5; vi. 18, 2. mānavīḥ). 4) Av. iii. 24, 3. Special mention is frequently 5) Rv. ii. 2, 10; iii. 53, 16; iv. 38, 10; x. 60, 4; 119, 6; 178, 3; Av. iii. 24, 2; xii. 1, 42. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 141. made of the ‘five peoples’ (pañca kṛṣṭayaḥ). The exact sense of this expression is doubtful. See Panca Janāsaḥ.

kRShNa|कृष्ण
1. Kṛṣṇa (‘black’) denotes a dark-coloured animal or bird. In some passages, 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 6, 5; vi. 1, 3, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 4, 1; iii. 2, 1, 28. So kṛṣṇa-viṣāṇā, ‘horn of the black antelope,’ ibid., iii. 2, 1, 18, 28; 2, 20; iv. 4, 5, 2; v. 4, 2, 5; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 3, 7. See also the Aśvamedha passages, Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 17; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 36 (cf. ii. 1). as the context shows, an antelope is certainly meant. In a few others 2) Rv. x. 94, 5; Av. xi. 2, 2; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 27. a bird of prey seems indicated. See also Kṛṣṇājina.

kRShNa|कृष्ण
2. Kṛṣṇa appears as the name of a seer in one hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 85, 3. 4. Tradition assigns to him or to Viśvaka, son of Kṛṣṇa (Kārṣṇi), the authorship of the following hymn. 2) viii. 86. The word Kṛṣṇiya may be a patronymic 3) i. 116, 23; 117, 7. formed from the same name in two other hymns of the Rigveda, 4) As a patronymic, it would be an isolated formation (cf. however Pajriya), instead of Kārṣṇya. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 228a and 200. where the Aśvins are said to have restored Viṣṇāpū to Viśvaka Kṛṣṇya. In that case Kṛṣṇa would seem to be the grandfather of Viṣṇāpū. This Kṛṣṇa may be identical with Kṛṣṇa Āṅgirasa mentioned in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa. 5) xxx. 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 108; Macdonell, Vedia Mythology, p. 52.

kRShNadevakiiputra|कृष्णदेवकीपुत्र
3. Kṛṣṇa Devakī-putra is mentioned in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1) iii. 17, 6. as a pupil of the mythical Ghora Āṅgirasa. Tradition, 2) Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 169. and several modern writers like Grierson, Garbe, and von Schroeder, recognize in him the hero Kṛṣṇa, who later is deified. In their view he is a Kṣatriya teacher of morals, as opposed to Brahminism. 3) Von Schroeder, Vienna Oriental Journal, 19, 414, 415; Grierson, Encyclopadia of Religions, article ‘Bhakti’; Garbe, Bhagavadgītā. Cf. Weber, op. cit., 71; 148; Hopkins, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1905, 386. This is extremely doubtful. It appears better either to regard the coincidence of name as accidental, or to suppose that the reference is a piece of Euhemerism. To identify this Kṛṣṇa with the preceding, as does the St. Petersburg Dictionary, seems to be quite groundless.

kRShNahaariita|कृष्णहारीत
4. Kṛṣṇa Hārīta is mentioned as a teacher in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka. 1) iii. 2. 6. The Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 2) viii. 10. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 391, n.; Indian Literature, 50. has Kṛtsna in the parallel passage. 

kRShNadattalauhitaya|कृष्णदत्तलौहितय

kRShNaraatalauhitya|कृष्णरातलौहित्य
कृष्ण-रात लौहित्य<BR> (‘descendant of Lohita’) is mentioned in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 42, 1) as a pupil of Śyāmaiajayanta Lauhitya.

kRShNala|कृष्णल
कृष्णल<BR> denotes the berry of the Abrus precatorius, used as a weight according to the later authorities, one Māṣa (‘bean’) being equated to four Kṛṣṇalas. 1) Manu, viii. 134. In the sense of a weight it occurs in the Taittirīva 2) ii. 3, 2, 1 et seq. and other Saṃhitās, 3) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 4 (hiraṇya kṛṣṇala). and later. 4) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 6, 7; Anupada Sūtra, ix. 6. In the later language it is also called raktikā or guñjā (being a smooth red berry with a black spot at one end). Cf. Weber's edition of the Jyotiṣa, 82 et seq.; Indische Strcifen, 1, 102, 103.

kRShNaajina|कृष्णाजिन
कृष्णाजिन<BR> is the skin (ajina) of the black antelope (Kṛṣṇa.) It is repeatedly referred to in the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas 1) Av. ix. 6, 17; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 9, 2; v. 4, 4, 4: Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 1, 22; 4, 1; 9, 2, 35, etc. with regard to its ritual use.

kRShNaayasa|कृष्णायस
कृष्णायस<BR> (‘black metal’), ‘iron,’ is referred to in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (vi. 1, 6). See also Ayas and Kārṣṇāyasa.

kRsara|कृसर
कृसर,<BR> a term denoting a mess of rice and sesamum, often mentioned in the Sūtras, occurs in the Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) v. 2. Cf. Weber, Omina und Portenta, 315 et seq.

kekaya|केकय
केकय<BR> is the name of a tribe which in later days, and probably also in Vedic times, was settled in the north-west, oetween the Sindhu (Indus) and Vitastā. 1) Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 317, 332. In the Vedic texts the Kekayas are mentioned indirectly only in the name of their prince Aśvapati Kaikeya. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 6, 1, 2. et seq.; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 11, 4. Cf. Weber, Indian Litenature, 120; Indische Studien, 1, 126.

ketu|केतु
1. Ketu is a term which Weber 1) Indische Studien, 1, 41. The aruṇāḥ ketavaḥ (Av. xi. 10, 1. 2. 7), referred to in this sense in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, are not so treated by Böhtlingk in his Dictionary. understands in the sense of ‘meteor’ or ‘comet’ in the late Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa.

ketuvaajya|केतुवाज्य
2. Ketu Vājya (‘descendant of Vāja’) is mentioned as a teacher in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372.

kevarta|केवर्त
केवर्त, कैवर्त<BR> are two variant forms denoting ‘fisherman’ in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 1) xxx. 16, with Mahīdhara's note. and Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 2) iii. 4, 12, 1, with Sāyaṇa's note. lists of victims at the Puruṣamedha, or human sacrifice.

kesha|केश
केश,<BR> ‘hair of the head,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas. 1) Av. v. 19, 3; vi. 136, 3, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 22; xx. 5; xxv. 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 2, 48, etc. The hair was a matter of great care to the Vedic Indian, and several hymns of the Atharvaveda 2) vi. 136. 137. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 68; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 536, 537. are directed to securing its plentiful growth. Cutting or shaving (vap) the hair is often referred to. 3) Av. viii. 2, 17; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 3, 1, etc. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 425 et seq. For a man to wear long hair was considered effeminate. 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 2, 14. But cf. Vincent Smith, Indian Antiquary, 34, 203. As to modes of dressing the hair see Opaśa and Kaparda; as to the beard see Śmaśru.

keshin|केशिन्
1. Keśin is the name of a people occurring in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) xi. 8, 4, 6. Cf. Pānini, vi. 4, 165; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 131, 134. where their king is mentioned as learning from Khaṇḍika the atonement for a bad omen at the sacrifice. 

keshindaarbhya|केशिन्दार्भ्य
2. Keśin Dārbhya 1) This is the form of the name in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, and the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa; also later in the Bṛhaddevatā. or Dālbhya 2) This is the form in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. It also appears later in the Rigveda Anukramaṇī. (‘descendant of Darbha’) is a somewhat enigmatic figure. According to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3) xi. 8, 4, 1 et seq., as explained by Sāyaṇa. and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmana 4) iii. 29, 1 et seq. he was a king, sister's son of Uccaiḥśravas, according to the latter authority. His people were the Pañcālas, of whom the Keśins must therefore have been a branch, and who are said to have been threefold (tryanīka). 5) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxx. 2 (Weber Indische Studien, 3, 471); Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit.; Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xx. 25. A story is told of his having a ritual dispute with Ṣaṇḍika in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 6) i. 4, 12 (von Schroeder gives no variant reading; but ṣ and kh are constantly confused in manuscripts). this appears in another form in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 3) xi. 8, 4, 1 et seq., as explained by Sāyaṇa. He was a contemporary of a fellow sage, Keśin Sātyakāmi, according to the Maitrāyaṇī 7) i. 6, 5. and Taittirīya 8) ii. 6, 2, 3. Saṃhitās. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 9) xiii. 10, 8. attributes to him a Sāman or chant, and the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 10) vii. 4. tells how he was taught by a golden bird. In view of the fact that the early literature always refers to Dārbhya as a sage, it seems doubtful whether the commentator is right in thinking that the Śatapatha refers to a king and a people, when a sage alone may well be meant, while the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa is of no great authority. The latter work may have assumed that the reference in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 11) xxx. 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 193, 209; 2, 308; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 58, 59; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 62, n. 2. to the Keśin people signifies kingship, but this is hardly necessary.

keshinsaatyakaami|केशिन्सात्यकामि
3. Keśin Sātya-kāmi (‘descendant of Satyakāma’) is mentioned as a teacher and contemporary of Keśin Dārbhya in the Taittirīya (ii. 6, 2, 3) and Maitrāyaṇī (i. 6, 5) Saṃhitās. 

kesarapraabandhaa|केसरप्राबन्धा
केसर-प्राबन्धा<BR> --In the list of the crimes of the Vaitahavyas narrated in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 18, 11. is the cooking of the last she-goat (caramājām) of Kesaraprābandhā, who may presumably be deemed to have been a woman, ‘having braided hair.’ 2) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 432, 433. Ludwig, 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 447. followed by Whitney, 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 252. appears to amend the passage (carama-jām) as meaning ‘the last-born calf’ of Kesaraprābandhā, a cow. But this interpretation does not suit the name so well.

kaikeya|कैकेय
कैकेय,<BR> ‘king of the Kekayas,’ is an epithet of Aśvapati. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 6, 1, 2; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 11, 4.

kairaata|कैरात
कैरात<BR> is the name of a snake in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 13, 5. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 243--possibly, but not probably, the modern Karait.

Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 134. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 208. or as extinct.

kaishorya|कैशोर्य
कैशोर्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Kaiśori,’ is the patronymic of Kāpya in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 (Mādhyaṃdina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Kāṇva). 

koka|कोक
1. Koka, a word occurring in the Rigveda 1) vii. 104, 22 (koka-yātu, a ghost in the shape of a cuckoo). and the Atharvaveda, 2) v. 23, 4; viii. 6, 2. seems to denote the ‘cuckoo.’ In all the three passages in which it is found, Sāyaṇa explains it as the Cakravāka. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 6. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 454; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 262; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 49; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 92. renders it in the Atharvaveda passages as a certain destructive parasitic animal. Cf. Anyavāpa.

koka|कोक
2. Koka is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 5, 4, 17) as a son of the Pañcāla king, Sātrāsāha.

kokila|कोकिल
कोकिल,<BR> a very frequent word in the Epic and later, denoting the cuckoo, is only inferred for the Vedic period from its being the name of a Rājaputra in the Kāṭhaka Anukramaṇī. 1) Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 460.

koNeya|कोणेय
कोणेय, कौणेय<BR> See Rajana.

kola|कोल
कोल,<BR> another form of Kuvala, the Zizyphus jujuba, is mentioned in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (vii. 3, 1).

kosha|कोश
1. Kośa is the name in the Rigveda 1) i. 130, 2; iii. 32, 15; iv. 17, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 156. for the ‘bucket’ used in drawing water by means of a rope from a well (Avata). In the ritual 2) Rv. ix. 75. 3; Av. xviii. 4. 30, etc. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 183 et seq. it denotes a large vessel to hold Soma, as opposed to Kalaśa.

kosha|कोश
2. Kośa denotes the body of a chariot. 1) Rv. i. 87, 2; x. 85, 7, etc. Presumably it was fastened to the axles, but it was probably not very secure, as the body of Pūṣan's chariot is said not to fall. 2) Rv. vi. 54, 3. The ropes 3) Gāvaḥ, Rv. viii. 48, 5. used to fasten the Kośa are perhaps referred to in the word akṣā-nah. 4) See under 1. Akṣa. By synecdoche this word also denotes the whole chariot. 5) Rv. viii. 20, 8; 22, 9. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 246. See also Vandhura, Ratha. 

kosha|कोश
3. Kośa.<BR> --The exact sense of this word in Kośa-kārī, the designation of a female victim at the Puruṣamedha, or human sacrifice, 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 14; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 10, 1. is uncertain. It may be ‘sheath.’

koSha|कोष
कोष<BR> --The Koṣas appear as a priestly family in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, where one of them, Suśravas, is mentioned by name. 2) x. 5, 5, 1. ^1 x. 5, 5, 8.

kosala|कोसल
कोसल<BR> is the name of a people not occurring in the earliest Vedic literature. In the story of the spread of Āryan culture told in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) i. 4, 1, 1 et seq. the Kosala-Videhas, as the offspring of Videgha Māthava, appear as falling later than the Kuru-Pañcālas under the influence of Brahminism. The same passage gives the Sadānīrā as the boundary of the two peoples --Kosala and Videha. Elsewhere 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 4. Cf. Hiraṇya-nābha, a Rājaputra, in Praśna Upaniṣad, iii. 2, and Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 9, 13, as a Kausalya, while ibid., 11, Para is styled Vaideha. the Kausalya, or Kosala king, Para Āṭṇāra Hairaṇyanābha, is described as having performed the great Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice. Connexion with Kāśi and Videha appears also from a passage of the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra. 3) xvi. 29, 5. Weber 4) Indische Studien, 1, 182, 441. points out that Āśvalāyana, who was very probably a descendant of Aśvala, the Hotṛ priest of Videha, is called a Kosala in the Praśna Upaniṣad. 5) vi. 1. The later distinction of North and South Kosala is unknown to both Vedic and Buddhist literature. 6) Oldenberg, Buddha, 393, n. Cf. von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 167; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xlii; Weber, Indian Literature, 39, 132 et seq.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 213-215; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 25. Kosala lay to the north-east of the Ganges, and corresponded roughly to the modern Oudh.

kaukuusta|कौकूस्त
कौकूस्त<BR> is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) iv. 6, 1, 13. as a giver of a Daksiṇā, or gift to the priests officiating at a sacrifice. The Kāṇva recension reads the name Kaükthasta. 2) Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 426, n. 1. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 134.

kauNDinyaayana|कौण्डिन्यायन
कौण्डिन्यायन<BR> is mentioned in the first Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1) ii. 5, 20. as a pupil of Kauṇḍinya, pupil of Kauṇḍinya and Āgniveśya; in the second 2) iv. 5, 26. as a pupil of the two Kauṇḍinyas, pupil of Kauṇḍinya and Āgniveśya. Neither Vaṃśa is of much value. 3) Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xxxiv.

kautasta|कौतस्त
कौतस्त,<BR> a word occurring once in the dual, is apparently a patronymic of Arimejaya and Janamejaya, two Adhvaryu priests at the snake sacrifice described in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

kautsa|कौत्स

kaurupancaala|कौरुपञ्चाल
कौरु-पञ्चाल,<BR> ‘belonging to the Kuru-Pañcālas,’ is an epithet of Āruṇi in the Śatapatha Brāhmana (xi. 4, 1, 2), and a practice of those tribes is designated by this word in the same work (i. 7, 2, 8).

kaulakaavatii|कौलकावती
कौलकावती<BR> are two persons mentioned in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (ii. 1, 3) as having given advice, in the capacity of priests, to Rathaprota Dārbhya.

kaulaala|कौलाल
कौलाल<BR> is a word denoting a hereditary potter (‘son of a kulāla or potter’) according to the commentator Mahīdhara on the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 1) xxx. 7. The other Samhitās 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 13, and cf. Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 27. have Kulāla.

kaulitara|कौलितर
कौलितर<BR> is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) iv. 30. 14. as a Dāsa. Apparently the name is an epithet of Śambara, meaning ‘son of Kulitara’: this points to Śambara having been a terrestrial foe, and not a mere demon. 2) Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 273; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 64, 161.

kauliika|कौलीक

कौशाम्बेय<BR> is the patronymic (‘descendant of Kuśāmba’) of a teacher Proti in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xii. 2, 2, 13; Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 24. according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary: a view supported by the fact that Kūśāmba actually occurs as the name of a man in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 2) viii. 6, 8. The name is also found later (in the Epic) in the form of Kuśāmba. It is, however, possible that the word means a ‘native of the town Kauśāmbī’ as understood by Harisvāmin in his commentary on the Śatapatha Brāhmana. 3) Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 153, n. 5. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 193; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 3, 36; Oldenberg, Buddha, 397.

He is rarely mentioned elsewhere. 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 3, 1; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 5, 2. The doctrine of Kauṣītaki is called the Kauṣītaka. 5) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1; xix. 3; Sāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 2, 13; xi. 14, 26; Anupada Sūtra, ii. 7: vii. 11 viii. 5, etc. The pupils of Kauṣītaki are known as the Kauṣītakis in the Nidāna Sūtra, 6) vi. 12. and in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 7) xvii. 4, 3. they with Kuṣītaka are stated to have been cursed by Luśākapi. Elsewhere 8) Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, x. 1. 10; Āśvalāvana Grhya Sūtra, i. 23. they are called Kauṣītakins. If the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 9) Cf Kelth, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 14, 24, 71 can be trusted, there were among them at least two leading teachers, Kahoḍa and Sarvajit, the former of whom is mentioned elsewhere. 10) Sarapatna Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 3, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 4, 1; Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 4.

kausurubindi|कौसुरुबिन्दि
कौसुरुबिन्दि,<BR> ‘descendant of Kusurubinda,’ is the patronymic of Proti Kauśāmbeya in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xii. 2, 2, 13). In the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa (i. 4, 24) the form is Kausuravindu.

कौहड,<BR> ‘descendant of Kohaḍa,’ is the patronymic of a teacher, Mitravinda, mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 1) Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 372, 382 et seq. A school of Kauhaḍīyas is known in the Gobhila Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 4, 34. as well as of Śravaṇadatta.

kratujitjaanaki|क्रतुजित्जानकि
क्रतु-जित् जानकि<BR> (‘descendant of Janaka’) is mentioned in the Yajurveda 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 8, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 474. as the priest of Rajana Kauṇeya. See also Kratuvid. 

kratuvidjaanaki|क्रतुविद्जानकि
क्रतु-विद् जानकि<BR> (‘descendant of Janaka’) is mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (vii. 34) as having learned a certain doctrine regarding Soma from Agni.

kraya|क्रय
क्रय,<BR> ‘sale,’ is a word which does not actually occur in the Rigveda, though the verb krī, from which this noun is derived, is found there. 1) iv. 24, 10. Both noun and verb are common in the later Saṃhitās. 2) Kraya: Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 2, 1; vi. 1, 3, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, viii. 55; xix. 13; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 2, 10, etc.; krī: Av. iii. 15, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 10, 3; vii. 1, 6, 2, etc.; apa-krī: Av. viii. 7, 11; pari-krī: Av. iv. 7, 6, etc.; vi-krī: Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 49, etc. Sale appears to have regularly consisted in barter in the Rigveda: 3) iv. 24, 10. ten cows are regarded as a possible price for an (image of) Indra to be used as a fetish, while elsewhere not a hundred, nor a thousand, nor a myriad are considered as an adequate price (śulka) for the purchase of Indra. 4) Rv. viii. 1, 5. The Atharvaveda 5) iv. 7, 6. mentions, as possible objects of commerce, garments (dūrśa), coverlets (pavasta), and goatskins (ajina). The haggling of the market was already familiar in the days of the Rigveda, 6) iv. 24, 9. See Oldenberg, ṚgvedaNoten, 1, 419, 420, correcting Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 91, and Geldner's Kommentar on iv. 24. and a characteristic hymn of the Atharvaveda 7) iii. 15. See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 352; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 111, 112. is directed to procuring success in trade. The ‘price’ was called Vasna, and the ‘merchant’ Vaṇij. his greed being well known. 8) Rv. i. 33, 3, and See Paṇi. There is little evidence of a standard of value in currency having been adopted. When no specific mention is made of the standard, the unit was probably the cow. 9) Cf. Harisvāmin on Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 2, 1, where he renders sahasrārha as equal to ‘worth a thousand cows,’ in which Eggeling follows him; Saṃkṣiptasāra on Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxii. 10, 33. In a considerable number of passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10) xii. 7, 2, 13; 9, 1, 4; xiii. 1, 1, 4; 2, 3, 2; 4, 1, 13; xiv. 3, 1, 32. Cf. v. 5, 5, 16; xiii. 4, 1, 6. and elsewhere, 11) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xviii. 3, 2, where a long series of compounds of numerals with -māna occurs; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, viii. 5; xiv. 8; xxii. 8. however, the expression hiraṇyaṃ śata-mānam suggests that there must have been some standard other than cows, though it might in all these passages be rendered as ‘gold worth a hundred cows.’ But the use of the Kṛṣṇala as a measure of weight 12) Cf. Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 4; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 6, 7; Anupada Sūtra, ix. 6: Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 99-103. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 255260. Barter had for the most part passed away by the time of the Jātakas, an illustration of the modern character of the society they represent. See Mrs. Rhys Davids, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1901, 874 et seq. suggests that the meaning is ‘gold weighing a hundred Kṛṣṇalas,’ and this seems the more probable explanation. This unit seems not to be known in the Rigveda, where the meaning of the term Manā, which occurs once, is mysterious, and where necklets (Niṣka) seem to have been one of the more portable forms of wealth, like jewellery in modern India, and may perhaps have served as a means of exchange.

kravaNa|क्रवण
क्रवण,<BR> a word occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) v. 44. 9. is understood by Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138. as the name of the Hotṛ priest or the sacrificer. Roth considered it an adjective without at first 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. assigning a sense, but afterwards 4) Böhtlingk's Dictionary, s.v. as meaning ‘timid.’ Sāyaṇa interprets it as ‘worshipping.’ Oldenberg 5) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 342. considers the meaning uncertain, suggesting as possible ‘the slayer of the victim.’

kravya|क्रव्य
क्रव्य,<BR> ‘raw flesh,’ is never mentioned in Vedic literature as eaten by men. Demons alone are spoken of as consuming it, 1) Rv. vii. 104, 2; x. 87, 2. 19; 162, 2; Av. iii. 28, 2; iv. 36, 3: v. 29 10, etc. apart from Agni being called kravyād, ‘eating raw flesh,’ as consumer of the bodies of the dead. 2) Rv. x. 16, 9. 10. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 97, 165. The man who in the Rigveda is compelled by starvation to eat dog's flesh, nevertheless cooks it. 3) iv. 18, 13. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 270, 271.

kraatujaateya|क्रातुजातेय
क्रातु-जातेय<BR> is a patronymic of Rāma Krātujāteya Vaiyāghrapadya in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 40, 2; iv. 16, 1).

krimi|क्रिमि
क्रिमि<BR> See Kṛmi. 

krivi|क्रिवि
क्रिवि<BR> is asserted in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 5, 4, 7. to have been the older name of the Pañcālas. This statement is supported by the name of the king there mentioned, Kraivya Pāñcāla, The Krivis appear in the Rigveda 2) viii. 20, 24; 22, 12. ElsewhereKrivi is doubtful in sense. In several passages (i. 30, 1; viii. 87, 1; ix. 9, 6, and perhaps i. 166, 6, where krivir-datī is an epithet of lightning) Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, i. 166, 341, understands the word to mean ‘horse.’ Elsewhere (ii. 17, 6; 22, 2; viii. 51, 8) he takes it to be a proper name, while in v. 44, 4, he is doubtful. In the passages last cited this view may very well be correct. as settled on the Sindhu and the Asiknī. It is a plausible conjecture of Zimmer's 3) Altindisches Leben, 103. that with the Kurus they made up the Vaikarṇa people. 4) Cf. Kavaṣa. The importance of the Pañcālas, and the insignificance of the Krivis, may be explained in part by the fact that the later Kuru-Pañcāla alliance included the Bharatas. It is also probable, as Oldenberg 5) Buddha, 404. suggests, from the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 6) xiii. 5, 4, 16. that the Turvaśas were included in the Pañcālas, and as the latter name indicates, probably other tribes also. Or, if Hopkins' view 7) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 258 et seq. This view is hardly convincing, while the disappearance of the Turvaśas is easily to be accounted for by their being merged, along with the Krivis, in the Pañcālas. The name of Krivi is lost in the Epic as completely as that of Turvaśa (Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 48, notes 4, 5). Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 155, 157; Grierson, Journal of the Royal Astatic Society, 1908, 602-607; Keith, ibid., 831 et seq.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 152, 153; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xli.; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 407. is accepted that Turvaśa was king of the Yadus, the latter may in part have been allied with the Krivis to form the Pañcālas.

kriitavaitahotra|क्रीतवैतहोत्र
क्रीत वैत-होत्र<BR> (‘descendant of Vītahotra’) is mentioned in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (iv. 2, 6) in connexion with the Kurus.

krunc|क्रुञ्च्
1. Kruñc, 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 6; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxviii. 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 73 et seq.; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 2, 1-3. Kruñca, 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 22. 31 (in xxv. 6 the sense is quite uncertain); Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 3. Krauñca, 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 12, 1. are variant forms denoting the ‘curlew’ or ‘snipe.’ To it is attributed in the Yajurveda 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 6; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxviii. 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 73 et seq.; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 2, 1-3. the faculty, later assigned to the Haṃsa, of extracting milk from water when the two fluids are mixed. 4) Lanman, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 151-158; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 150. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 91, 92.

krunchaangirasa|क्रुन्चाङ्गिरस
2. Krunc Āṅgirasa is in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 9, 11; 11, 20. the name of the seer of a Sāman or Chant called the Krauñca. It is doubtless invented to explain the name of the Chant on the ordinary principle that Sāmans are called after their authors, though this rule has many exceptions. 2) Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 68. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160.

krumu|क्रुमु
क्रुमु<BR> is the name of a stream mentioned twice in the Rigveda--once in the fifth book 1) v. 53, 9. and once in the last, in the Nadī-stuti, or ‘praise of rivers.’ 2) x. 75, 6. There can be little doubt that this river is identical with the modern Kurum, a western tributary of the Indus. 3) Roth, Nirukta, Erläuterungen, 43; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14: Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200.

krumuka|क्रुमुक
क्रुमुक<BR> as the name of ‘wood’ appears to be a variant form of Kṛmuka. ^1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 9, 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 7, 3.

kraivya|क्रैव्य
क्रैव्य। पाञ्चाल,<BR> the king of the Krivis, 1) So the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Weber, Indian Literature, 125, n.; Oldenberg, Buddha, 409, n. is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) xiii. 5, 4, 7. as having performed the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice, on the Parivakrā. Eggeling, 3) Sacred Books of the East, 44, 397 (but cf. p. 398, top). however, takes the word as a proper name, ‘Kraivya, the Pāñcāla king.’

krosha|क्रोश
क्रोश,<BR> as a measure of distance (lit. ‘a shout,’ as expressing the range of the voice), is found in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xvi. 13, 12. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 8, 432 et seq. In the later literature it is equivalent to about two miles. The word still survives in the vernacular form of Kos as the most popular measure of distance in India. 

kroShTR|क्रोष्टृ
क्रोष्टृ<BR> (lit. ‘howler’), the ‘jackal,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) x. 28, 1. as by nature cowardly compared with the wild boar (Varāha). In the Atharvaveda 2) xi. 2, 2. it is spoken of as devouring corpses. The word also occurs in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 3) xxiv. 32. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 84. where the commentator glosses it with Sṛgāla, another name of the jackal. See also Lopāśa.

kraunca|क्रौञ्च
1. Krauñca. See Kruñc.

kraunca|क्रौञ्च
2. Krauñca, as the name of a mountain, occurs only in the latest Vedic literature. 1) Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, i. 31, 2. See Weber, Indian Literature, 93; Indische Studien, 1, 78.

krauncikiiputra|क्रौञ्चिकीपुत्र
क्रौञ्चिकी-पुत्र,<BR> ‘son of a female descendant of Krauñca,’ is mentioned as a pupil of Vaiṭṭabhatīputra 1) Vaidabhṛtī-putra in the Mādhyaṃdina recension, vi. 4, 32. in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 2) vi. 5, 2 (Kāṇva).

krauShTuki|क्रौष्टुकि
क्रौष्टुकि,<BR> ‘descendant of Kroṣṭuka,’ is mentioned as a grammarian in the Nirukta, 1) viii. 2. the Bṛhaddevatā, 2) iv. 137. Cf. Indische Studien, 1, 105. and the Chandas, 3) 5. but as an astrologer in a Pariśiṣṭa of the Atharvaveda. 4) Weber, Berlin Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS., 1, 94. See Bolling and von Negelein. The Pariśiṣṭas of the Atharvaveda, 2, 438 et seq., where in Pariśiṣṭa lxviii (Svapnādhyāyaḥ), i. 2; ii. 8, the name appears as Kroṣṭuki. Cf. Weber, Jyotiṣa, 12; Indian Literature, 61.

kvayii|क्वयी
क्वयी<BR> is the name of some species of bird in the Yajurveda, 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 17, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 29. occurring in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice. The form in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 2) iii. 14, 18. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99 is Kuvaya. 

kvala|क्वल
क्वल<BR> is a substance, perhaps 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. identical with Kuvala, the fruit of the jujube, used to coagulate milk according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 2) ii. 5, 3, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 227.

xata|क्षत
क्षत<BR> is regarded by Zimmer 1) Altindisches Leben, 377. as denoting a special disease (a sort of Phthisis pulmonalis) in the Atharvaveda, 2) vii. 76, 4 (where the reading is doubtful, the text having akṣita. See Akṣata). but the word is probably only an adjective. 3) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 509; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 442.

xattR|क्षत्तृ
क्षत्तृ<BR> is a word of frequent occurrence in the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas, denoting a member of the royal entourage, but the sense is somewhat uncertain. In the Rigveda 1) vi. 13, 2. it is used of a god as the ‘distributor’ of good things to his worshippers; the same sense seems to be found in the Atharvaveda 2) iii. 24, 7; v. 17, 4. and elsewhere. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 6; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 9, 16. In one passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 4) xxx. 13. Cf. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 3, 5. the interpretation ‘doorkeeper’ is given by the commentator Mahīdhara, a sense which seems possible in other passages, 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 4, 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 13; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 1, 5; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xix. 1, 4. while Sāyaṇa ascribes to it in one passage of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 6) v. 3, 1, 7. Cf. on xiii. 4, 2, 5 (āyavyayādhyakṣa), and Harisvāmin on xiii. 5, 4, 6 (kośādhyakṣa). The scholiast on the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 3, 9. has mantrī dūto vā; on xx. 1, 16, pratīhāro dūto vā. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 61, etc., renders it ‘chamberlain.’ the more dignified meaning of antaḥpurādhyakṣa, ‘a chamberlain.’ In other passages, 7) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 26; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 7, 1, with the scholiast's note, and ibid., anukṣattṛ, rendered as sārather anucara, ‘the attendant of the charioteer’; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 1, 20, with the scholiast's note. again, the sense of ‘charioteer’ is not unlikely. Later the Kṣattṛ was regarded as a man of mixed caste. 8) Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 481. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 36; 17, 290; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

Kṣatra, in the general sense of ‘dominion,’ ‘rule,’ ‘power,’ as exercised by gods and men, occurs frequently from the Rigveda 1) i. 24, 11; 136, 1. 3; iv. 17. 1; v. 62, 6, etc.; Av. iii. 5, 2; v. 18, 4, etc. So kṣatra-śrī, Rv. i. 25, 5; vi. 26. 8; kṣatra-bhṛt, ‘bringers of lordship.’ Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 7, 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 6, 12; 7, 6, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxvii. 7, etc. onwards. The word is also found in the concrete sense of ‘rulers’ in the Rigveda 2) Singular: i. 157, 2; viii. 35, 17. and later; 3) Plural: Av. iv. 22, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 17; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 6, 3. but in no case does it in the Rigveda certainly 4) See Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and Varṇa. mean what it regularly denotes in the later Saṃhitās, 5) Av. ii. 15, 4: ix. 7, 9; xii. 5, 8; xv. 10, 5, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 1, 2; ii. 2, 11, 2, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, v. 27; xiv. 24; xviii. 38, etc. See other citations under Varṇa. the ruling class as opposed to the priests (Brahman), the subject people (Viś, Vaiśya), and the servile class (Śūdra). See also Kṣatriya. A Kṣatra-pati is several times mentioned 6) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 14, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 17; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 8, 5; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 2, 2. as an equivalent of ‘king.’

xatra|क्षत्र
2. Kṣatra seems to be the name of a man mentioned with others, including Manasa, Yajata, and Avatsāra, in one quite obscure passage of the Rigveda. 1) v. 44, 10. Cf. Ludwig. Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138.

xatravidyaa|क्षत्रविद्या
क्षत्र-विद्या,<BR> ‘the science of the ruling class,’ is mentioned in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 1) vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. Śaṅkara glosses the term with dhanur-veda, ‘the science of the bow,’ which is the most probable sense. 2) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 104.

xatriya|क्षत्रिय
क्षत्रिय<BR> --As the origin of caste, the relation of the castes, intermarriage, and cognate matters may most conveniently be discussed under Varṇa, this article will be confined to determining, as far as possible, the real character of the class called Kṣatriyas, or collectively Kṣatra. The evidence of the Jātakas 1)See Fick, Die sociale Gliederung im nordöstlichen Indien zu Buddhas Zoit, 59 et seq.; Rhys Davids, Dialogues of the Buddha, 1, 95 et seq.; Buddhist India, 52 et seq. points to the word Khattiya denoting the members of the old Āryan nobility who had led the tribes to conquest, as well as those families of the aborigines who had managed to maintain their princely status in spite of the conquest. In the epic 2) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 73 et seq. also the term Kṣatriya seems to include these persons, but it has probably a wider signification than Khattiya, and would cover all the royal military vassals and feudal chiefs, expressing, in fact, pretty much the same as the barones of early English history. Neither in the Jātakas 3) Fick, op. cit., 52, n. 2. nor in the epic 4) Hopkins, op. cit., 184 et seq., 190. is the term co-extensive with all warriors; the army contains many besides the Kṣatriyas, who are the leaders or officers, rather than the rank and file. In the later Saṃhitās 5) Av. vi. 76, 3. 4; xii. 5, 5. 44. 46, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 5, etc. See Varṇa and Rājanya. and the Brāhmaṇas 6) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 24, etc.; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 2, 15; iv. 1, 4, 5. 6, etc. See Varṇa. the Kṣatriya stands as a definite member of the social body, distinct from the priest, the subject people, and the slaves, Brāhmaṇa, Vaiśya, and Śūdra. It is significant that Rājanya is a variant to Kṣatriya, and an earlier one. Hence it is reasonable to suppose that the Kṣatriya and Rājanya are both of similar origin, being princely or connected with royalty. Moreover, the early use of Kṣatriya in the Rigveda 7) iv. 12, 3; 42, 1; v. 69, 1; vii. 64, 2; viii. 25, 8; 56, 1; x. 109, 3. Cf. Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iv. 19; x. 4; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 7, 7. is exclusively connected with royal authority or divine authority. It is impossible to say exactly what persons would be included in the term Kṣatriya. That it covered the royal house and the various branches of the royal family may be regarded as certain. It, no doubt, also included the nobles and their families: this would explain the occasional opposition of Rājanya and Kṣatriya, as in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 8) vii. 20. Cf. Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxiv. 18, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xx. 1. where a Rājanya asks a Kṣatriya for a place for sacrifice (deva-yajana). Thus, when strictly applied, Kṣatriya would have a wider denotation than Rājanya. As a rule, however, the two expressions are identical, and both are used as evidence in what follows. That Kṣatriya ever included the mere fighting man has not been proved: in the Rigveda 9) In the following passages there is reference to the people (viś) fighting: i. 69, 3; 126, 5 (cf., however, Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 121); iv. 24, 4; vi. 26, 1; vii. 79, 2; viii. 18, 18; 96, 15; probably also vii. 33, 6, where the Tṛtsūnāṃ viśaḥ means ‘the subjects of the Tṛtsu princes,’ as Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 136, thinks. In vi. 41, 5, on the other hand, the people and wars (pṛtanāsu) are contrasted, the normal rule of the common folk being peace. and later 10) In Av. ix. 7, 9, the people are clearly designated as balam, or ‘force,’ a regular term later for an armed force. The later law books (e.g., Gautama, vii. 6; Vasiṣṭha, ii. 22) allow even Brahmins to maintain themselves by the occupation of Kṣatriyas in case of need. For the Epic, cf. Hopkins, op. cit., 94, 95; 184 et seq. others than Kṣatriyas regularly fought; but possibly if the nobles had retinues as the kings had, Kṣatriya would embrace those retainers who had military functions. The term did not apply to all members of the royal entourage; for example, the Grāmaṇī was usually a Vaiśya. The connexion of the Kṣatriyas with the Brahmins was very close. The prosperity of the two is repeatedly asserted 11) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 10, 3; Maitrayaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 3; iii. 1, 9; 2, 3; iv. 3, 9; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxix. 10; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, v. 27; vii. 21; xviii. 14; xix. 5; xxxviii. 14, etc.; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xi. 11, 9; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 22; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 1, 7; iii. 5, 2, 11; 6, 1, 17; vi. 6, 3, 14. The superiority of the Rājanya to all other castes is asserted in Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 10, 1, etc. The superiority of the Brahmin to the Kṣatriya is sometimes asserted--e.g., in the Atharvaveda hymns, v. 18. 19; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 21; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 1, 9, 1; 3, 7, 8. So the Rājasūya sacrifice of the king is inferior to the highest sacrifice (the Vājapeya) of the priest (ibid., v. 1, 1, 12), and though the Brahmin goes after the king, he is yet stronger than he (v. 4, 2, 7, and v. 4, 4, 15). Cf. Hopkins, op. cit., 76. to be indissolubly associated, especially in the relation of king (Rājan) and domestic priest (Purohita). Sometimes there was feud between Kṣatriya and Brahmin. 12) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxviii. 5; Av. v. 18. 19. His management of the sacrifice then gave the Brahmin power to ruin the Kṣatriya by embroiling him with the people 13) E.g., Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 11, 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 6, 5; ii. 1, 9; iii. 3, 10; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxix. 8, etc. or with other Kṣatriyas. 14) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 3, 10, etc. Towards the common people, on the other hand, the Kṣatriya stood in a relation of well-nigh unquestioned superiority. 15) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvi. 4; xxi. 10; xxii. 9; xxix. 9. 10; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 33; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 2, 7, 15. 16, etc.; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 9. 10; 6, 8, etc. There are, however, references to occasional feuds between the people and the nobles, 16) Cf. note 13; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 4, 6, 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 6, 7. in which no doubt the inferior numbers of the latter were compensated by their superior arms and prowess. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 17) vii. 29. Cf. Rājan. the Vaiśya is described as tributary to another (anyasya bali-kṛt), to be devoured by another (anyasyādya), and to be oppressed at will (yathākāma-jyeya). Probably these epithets apply most strictly to the relation of the king and his people, but the passage shows that the people were greatly at the mercy of the nobles. No doubt the king granted to them the right, which may have been hereditary, to be supported by the common people, whose feudal superiors they thus became. In return for these privileges the Kṣatriyas had probably duties of protection to perform, as well as some judicial functions, to judge from an obscure passage of the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 18) xxvii. 4 (tasmād rājanyenādhyakṣeṇa vaiśyaṃ ghnanti, ‘so with a Rājanya as a supervisor[?]<BR>they smite a Vaiśya’). It is not clear whether han here means ‘kill’ or ‘beat.’ The main duty of the Kṣatriya in the small states 19) See Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 30, n. 2. of the Vedic period was readiness for war. The bow is thus his special attribute, 20) Av. xviii. 2, 60; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xviii. 9; xxxvii. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 5, 30; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, vi. 1, 3. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 19, the list is longer--chariot, breastplate (Kavaca), bow and arrow (iṣu-dhanvan)--and in the prayer for the prosperity of the Kṣatriya (called, as usual in the older texts, Rājanya), at the Aśvamedha, the Rājanva is to be an archer and a good chariot-fighter; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 18, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 12, 6; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, Aśvamedha, v. 14; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 2. So Indra is the god of the Kṣatriyas, Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 1; iv. 5, 8, etc. just as the goad is that of the agriculturist; for the bow is the main weapon of the Veda. Whether the Kṣatriyas paid much attention to mental occupations is uncertain. In the latest stratum of the Brāhmaṇa literature there are references to learned princes like Janaka of Videha, who is said to have become a Brahmin (brahmā), apparently in the sense that he had the full knowledge which a Brahmin possessed. 21) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 6, 2, 1. Cf. Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv. 1. See Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Litcrature, 421 et seq.; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 426 et seq. Similarly at the Dīkṣā a Kṣatriya becomes temporarily a Brahmin, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 23. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 1, 3. Other learned Kṣatriyas of this period were Pravāhaṇa Jaivali, 22) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 1; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 8, 1; v. 3, 1; Muir, op. cit., 433-435; 515; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 117; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 1, lxxv. Aśvapati Kaikeya, 23) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 6, 1, 2 et seq. and Ajātaśatru. 24) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 1, 1; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv. 1. Garbe, 25) Beiträge zur indischen Kulturgeschichte, 1 et seq. Cf. Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 17 et seq.; Winterniz, Geschichte der indischen Litteratur, 1, 199. Grierson, 26) Article ‘Bhakti’ in Encyclopœdia of Religion and Ethics; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 843. and others believe they are justified in holding the view that the Ksatriyas developed a special philosophy of their own as opposed to Brahminism, which appears later as Bhakti, or Faith. On the other hand, there is clear evidence 27) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, viii. 1, 4, 10. Cf. Oldenberg. Buddha, 73, n. 1; Keith, Aitareya Āranyaka, 50, 257; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 868, 883, 1140-1142. Professor Eggeling concurs in the view that the Kṣatriya share in the religious movement was not substantially real. that the opinion of Ksatriyas on such topics were held in little respect, and it must be remembered that to attribute wisdom to a king was a delicate and effective piece of flattery. There are earlier references to royal sages (rājanyarṣi), 28) E.g., in Pañcavimśa Brāhmaṇa, xii. 12, 6; but see on this Oldenberg. Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, 42, 235, n., and Varṇa. but it is very doubtful if much stress can be laid on them, and none can be laid on the later tradition of Sāyaṇa. 29) Cited in Muir, op. cit., 12, 265 et seq. Again, the Nirukta 30) ii. 10. gives a tradition relating how Devāpi, a king's son, became the Purohita of his younger brother Śaṃtanu; but it is very doubtful if the story can really be traced with Sieg 31) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 91 et seq. See Devāpi. in the Rigveda 32) x. 98. The case of Viśvāmitra may also be cited; but his royal rank, which is attested by the mention of him as a Rājaputra in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 17, is at most merely a matter of descent, and is of very doubtful authenticity. See under Varṇa. itself. In any case, the stories refer only to a few selected Kṣatriyas of high rank, while there is no evidence that the average Kṣatriya was concerned with intellectual pursuits. Nor is there any reference to Kṣatriyas engaging in agriculture or in trade or commerce. It may be assumed that the duties of administration and war were adequate to absorb his attention. On the other hand, we do hear of a Rājanya as a lute player and singer at the Aśvamedha or horse sacrifice. 33) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 3, 5. This mention is proof of the existence of a class of Kṣatriya bards (as opposed to priestly reciters), from whose productions the Epic naturally grew up. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 258. Of the training and education of a Kṣatriya we have no record; presumably, as in fact if not in theory later on, he was mainly instructed in the art of war, the science of the bow, and the rudimentary administrative functions which would devolve on him. At this early state of the development of the nobility which appears to be represented in the Rigveda, it was probably not unusual or impossible for a Vaiśya to become a Kṣatriya; at least, this assumption best explains the phrase 34) vii. 104, 13. Cf. for a similarly false claim to be a Brahmin, x. 71, 8. ‘claiming falsely a Kṣatriya's rank’ (kṣatriyaṃ mithuyā dhārayantam). The king and the Kṣatriyas must have stood in a particularly close relation. The former being the Kṣatriya par excellence, it is to him rather than to the ordinary Kṣatriya that we must refer passages like that in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 35) vii. 1, 1, 8. where it is said that the Kṣatriya, with the consent of the clansmen, gives a settlement to a man: clearly a parallel to the rule found among many peoples that the chief, but only with the consent of the people, can make a grant of unoccupied land. In the same Brāhmaṇa 36) xii. 8, 3, 19; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 254, n. 1. it is said that a Kṣatriya consecrates a Kṣatriya, a clear reference, as the commentator explains, to the practice of the old king consecrating the prince (kumāra) who is to succeed him; and again, 37) Cf. Eggeling, ibid., 41, 259. the Kṣatriya and the Purohita are regarded as alone complete in contrast with other people, the parallel with the Purohita here suggesting that the Kṣatriya par excellence is meant. On the other hand, the king is sometimes contrasted with the Rājanya. 38) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 2, 17, and see Rājanya. The Sūtra literature contains elaborate rules 39) See references in Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, 395, 396. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 212 et seq.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 231 et seq.; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 151 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 4 et seq. (where practically every passage on the subject is cited or referred to); Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 98 et seq. (for the Epic parallels). for the educa tion and occupations of Kṣatriyas, but their contents cannot always be traced in the Brāhmaṇa literature, and their value is questionable.

xapaavan|क्षपावन्
क्ष-पावन्,<BR> ‘protector of the earth,’ 1) The word occurs only in the nominative singular as kṣapāvān, which would be the regular form from a stem kṣapāvant; but it is probably an irregularity for kṣapāvā. Cf. Oldenberg. Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 72. is an epithet of a king, 2) iii. 55, 17. or denotes a king 3) i. 70, 5; vii. 10, 5; viii. 71, 2; x. 29, 1. Cf. kṣiti-pa, ‘guardian of earth,’ ‘king,’ in later Sanskrit. in the Rigveda. The word is significant, as showing the function of the king as the protector of the tribal territory.

xiti|क्षिति
क्षिति<BR> is in the Rigveda 1) i. 65, 3; iii. 13, 4; v. 37. 4, etc. a regular word for ‘dwelling,’ and in particular the kṣitir dhruvā, ‘the secure dwelling,’ is mentioned 2) i. 73, 4 (cf. 2); vii. 88, 7. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 142. in a context that shows it, to be equivalent to the Vṛjana or Grāma regarded as a stronghold. From this sense is developed that of the peoples occupying the settlements, 3) Rv. iii. 38, 1; iv. 24, 4; 38, 5; v. 1, 10, etc. and in particular the five peoples 4) i. 7, 9; 176, 3; v. 35, 2; vi. 46, 7; vii. 75, 4; 79, 1. (for whom see Pañca Janāsaḥ).

xipta|क्षिप्त
क्षिप्त,<BR> ‘a wound’ (caused by shooting), or ‘bruise’ (caused by throwing), is mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 109, 1. 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 389. together with a remedy for it, the Pippalī.

xiprashyena|क्षिप्रश्येन
क्षिप्र-श्येन,<BR> ‘swift falcon,’ is the name of a bird in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (iii. 14, 11) and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa x. 5, 2, 10).

xiira|क्षीर
क्षीर,<BR> ‘milk,’ also called Go or Payas, played a large part in the economy of the Vedic Indians. 1) The word kṣīra does not occur in Rv. ii. vii. It is found in i. 109, 3; 164, 7; viii. 2, 9; ix. 67, 32; x. 87, 16 (= Av. viii. 3, 15). See Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 64, 73 et seq. See also Av. ii. 26, 4; v. 19, 5; x. 9, 12, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 8, 7, etc. It was taken warm (pakva as it came from the cow, 2)i. 62, 9; 180, 3; iii. 30, 4. or was used with grain to make a ‘mess cooked with milk’ (kṣīra-pākam odanam). 3)Rv. viii. 77, 10; Av. xiii. 2, 20. Cf. kṣīra-śrī, ‘milk-mixed,’ Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 0, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, viii. 57, etc. It was also used for mixing with Soma (Abhiśrī, Āśir). From it butter (Ghṛta) was made. Milk was also curdled, the Pūtīkā and Kvala plants, among others, being used for the purpose. 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 3, 5. The curdled milk (Dadhi) was undoubtedly used for food; and a kind of cheese is perhaps referred to in one passage of the Rigveda. 5) vi. 48, 18. Goat's milk (aja-kṣīra) is also mentioned. 6) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1, 2, 13; see Aja. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 63, 226, 226, 268.

xiiraudana|क्षीरौदन
क्षीरौदन,<BR> ‘rice cooked with milk,’ is mentioned frequently in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ii. 5, 3, 4; xi. 5, 7, 5, etc.).

xudrasuuktas|क्षुद्रसूक्तस्
क्षुद्र-सूक्तस्,<BR> ‘makers of short hymns,’ is the name given in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka 1) ii. 2, 2. Cf. Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 212, and Macdonell, Bṛhaddevatā. notes on iii. 116. to the authors of certain hymns of the Rigveda. Cf. Mahāsūkta.

xumpa|क्षुम्प
क्षुम्प<BR> is a word occurring only in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 84, 8. where it seems to mean a ‘bush.’ The Nirukta 2) v. 16. Cf. Benfey, Sāmaveda, Glossar, 53. identifies it with the Ahichatraka, a ‘mushroom.’

xura|क्षुर
क्षुर<BR> occurs three times in the Rigveda. The word appears to have the general sense of ‘blade’ 1) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 61, 69. Cf. 13, 292 (as ‘knife’ in the Epic). in one passage, 2) i. 166, 10 (paviṣu kṣurāḥ on the fellies of the Maruts' car; possibly ‘razors’ may be meant, as Max Müller says in his note on this passage, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 235, n. 4). possibly also in another, 3) x. 28, 9, where Sāyaṇa renders it as meaning ‘having claws.’ The later tradition ascribes the swallowing to a goat. where it is said that the hare swallowed a Kṣura, and where the sense ‘blade’ is adequate. In the third passage 4) viii. 4, 16 (saṃ naḥ śiśīhi bhurijor iva kṣuram, ‘sharpen us like a razor on a grindstone or stropping apparatus’). there seems to be a reference to the sharpening of a razor on a grindstone 5) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. (bhurijos, the dual denoting precisely, as Pischel 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 243. points out, the two sides of the apparatus, between which the stone revolved like the modern grindstone). But Muir, 7) Sanskrit Texts, 5, 466. following another view of Roth, 8) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. bhurij. adopts the sense ‘the edge of scissors,’ which, however, hardly suits the other passage, one in the Atharvaveda, 9) xx. 127, 4. where a Kṣura is described as moving about on the bhurijos, 10) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 197, translates bhurijos by ‘on a strop.’ as the tongue on the lip. The meaning ‘razor’ is perfectly clear in the Atharvaveda, 11) vi. 68, 1. 3; viii. 2, 7. where shaving by means of it is mentioned; in many other passages 12) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 4, 5; iii. 1, 2, 7; kṣura-pavi, Av. xii. 5, 20. 55; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 5, 7; 5, 5, 6; v. 6, 6, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 6, 2, 9. etc.; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 10, 14; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvi. 8; Nirukta, v. 5. either sense is adequate. A kṣuro bhṛjvān occurs in the Yajurveda: 13) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 12, 3. Cf. Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 8, 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xv. 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5, 2, 4. it seems to denote, as Bloomfield 14) American Journal of Philology, 17, 418. suggests, a razor with a strop (in the shape of a small grinding apparatus). Kṣura-dhārā 15) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 13, 9. denotes ‘the edge of a razor,’ like kṣurasya dhārā. 16) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 3, 2. In the Upaniṣads 17) Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv. 20. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 266; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 239-243; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 38 et seq. a razor-case (Kṣura-dhāna) is mentioned. See also Śmaśru.

xetra|क्षेत्र
क्षेत्र,<BR> ‘field.’ The use of this word in the Rigveda points clearly to the existence of separate fields 1) x. 33, 6. Cf. iii. 31, 15; v. 62, 7. carefully measured off, 2) i. 110, 5. though in some passages the meaning is less definite, indicating cultivated land generally. 3) i. 100, 18; ix. 85, 4; 91, 6; Kṣetrajeṣa, i. 33, 15, ‘acquisition of land’; kṣetrā-sā, iv. 38, 1, ‘gaining land’; kṣetraṃ-jaya, ‘conquering cultivated land,’ Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 11. The wider sense of ‘place’ also occurs, v. 2, 3; 45, 9; vi. 47, 20, etc., and often later. In the Atharvaveda 4) iv. 18, 5; v. 31, 4; x. 1, 18; xi. 1, 22; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 1, 2; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vii. 24, 2, etc. and later the sense of a separate field is clearly marked, though the more general use is also found. 5) Av. ii. 29, 3; xiv. 2, 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 1, 15. 16, etc. The deity Kṣetrasya Pati, 6) Rv. iv. 37, 1, 2; vii. 35, 10; x. 66, 13; Av. ii. 8, 5; kṣetrasya patnī, ‘Mistress of the Field,’ 12, 1; kṣetrāṇāṃ patiḥ, ‘Lord of Fields,’ Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 18. ‘Lord of the Field,’ should probably be understood as the god presiding over each field, just as Vāstoṣ Pati presides over each dwelling. 7) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 138. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 1, 1, 8, where the Kṣatriya, with the consent of the people, gives a settlement to a man: that is, presumably assigns to him a definite Kṣetra for his own, probably measured out as recorded in Rv. i. 110, 5. It is a fair conclusion from the evidence that the system of separate holdings already existed in early Vedic times.^8 See also Urvarā, Khilya.

xetriya|क्षेत्रिय
क्षेत्रिय<BR> is a disease which is mentioned several times in the Atharvaveda, and against which three hymns are specially directed. 1) ii. 8. 10; iii. 7. Cf. ii. 14, 5; iv. 18, 7. It is also mentioned in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 2) xv. 1. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 3) ii. 5, 6, 1-3, where the form is Kṣetrī, explained as a demon causing illness, merely an incorrect version of Av. iii. 10. The commentators on the Atharvaveda agree in taking it to be a hereditary disease. The word may mean ‘organic,’ 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. or possibly ‘produced in the field,’ as a theory of its origin. What disease is really intended is quite uncertain. Weber 5) Indische Studien, 5, 145; 13, 150 et seq.: 17, 208; Naxatra, 2, 292. considered that the aim of the Atharvan hymns was to drive away injury threatening the fields, but this is improbable. Bloomfield 6) Atharvaveda, 60. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 286 et seq.; Whitney, Transiation of the Atharvaveda, 48, 49; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 391, 392; Speijer, De ceremonia apud Indos quœ jātakarma vocatur, 76-83; Pāṇini, v. 2, 92, with the Kāśikā Vṛtti. suggests ‘scrofula’ or ‘syphilis.’ The remedies mentioned throw no light on the symptoms. 

xemadhRtvanpauNDariika|क्षेमधृत्वन्पौण्डरीक
क्षेम-धृत्वन् पौण्डरीक<BR> (‘descendant of Puṇḍarīka’) is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) xxii. 18, 7. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 32. Later, the name is Kṣema-dhanvan, Harivaṃśa, 824, etc. as having sacrificed on the bank of the river Sudāman.

xaimi|क्षैमि
क्षैमि,<BR> ‘descendant of Kṣema,’ is the patronymic of Sudakṣiṇa in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 6, 3; 7, 1, etc.; 8, 6).

xoNii|क्षोणी
क्षोणी<BR> --This word, when used in the plural, denotes, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary and Ludwig, 1)Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 247. in several passages of the Rigveda, 2) i. 57, 4; 173, 7; viii. 3, 10; 13, 17; x. 95. 19. In ii. 34, 13; x. 22, 9, the sense is doubtful. the free retainers of the king. Geldner 3) Bezzenberger, Beiträge, 11, 327. at one time thought it referred to the wives of the king, pointing to polygamy; but later 4) Vedische Studien, 1, 279, 283. he concluded that it means certain divine wives.

xauma|क्षौम
क्षौम,<BR> ‘a linen garment,’ is mentioned in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (iii. 6, 7, etc.) and in the Sūtras.

xvinkaa|क्ष्विङ्का
क्ष्विङ्का<BR> is mentioned once in the Rigveda 1) x. 87, 7. as a bird of prey. The word also occurs in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 2) v. 5, 15, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93. where the commentary absurdly explains it as ‘a red-mouthed female ape’ (rakta-mukhī vānarī). KH.

kha|ख
ख<BR> denotes in the Rigveda 1) Rv. viii. 77, 3; 91, 7; x. 156, 3, where only the Kha is referred to. Cf. the adjective su-kha, ‘having a good axle-hole,’ ‘running easily’; later, ‘agreeable.’ and later 2) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, v. 12, 1 (Mādhyaṃdina; v. 10, 1 Kāṇva). the hole in the nave of the wheel in which the axle is inserted. There was a difference, it seems, in the size of the hole in the wheel of a cart (Anas) and of a chariot (Ratha). 3) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, 1, 3, 6; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 333. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 247. See also 1. Yuga.

khanga|खङ्ग
खङ्ग<BR> See Khaḍga.

khaDga|खड्ग
खड्ग<BR> is the reading in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 1) iii. 14, 21. of the name of an animal which, in the text of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 2) xxiv. 40. variously appears as Khaṅga and Khaḍga. The rhinoceros seems clearly to be meant. 3) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 86. In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 4) xiv. 33, 26 (khāḍga-kavaca aśvaratha) a rhinoceros hide is mentioned as the covering of a chariot.

khaNDikaaudbhaari|खण्डिकऔद्भारि
खण्डिक औद्भारि<BR> (‘descendant of Udbhāra’) is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xi. 8, 4, 1. as a teacher of Keśin, and in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 2) i. 4, 12, where Ṣaṇḍika is the reading of the MSS. as having been defeated by Keśin as a sacrificer. A Khāṇḍika appears in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 3) Caland, U7ber das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 20. as an enemy of Keśin.

khadira|खदिर
खदिर<BR> is mentioned frequently from the Rigveda 1) iii. 53, 19. onwards 2) Av. iii. 6, 1; v. 5, 5; viii. 8, 3; x. 6, 6; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 9, 3, etc. So khādira, ‘made of Khadira wood,’ Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 5, 7, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 3, 20; iii. 6, 2, 12 etc. as a tree with hard wood 3) Av. x. 6, 6.<BR> --the Acacia catechu. The Aśvattha is referred to as engrafting itself upon it in the Atharvaveda, 4) iii. 6, 1. Cf. viii. 8, 3. and from it the climbing plant Arundhatī is said to have sprung. 5) Av. v. 5. 5. The sruva or sacrificial ladle is spoken of as having been made from it, 6) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 5, 7, 1. no doubt because of its hardness. It is in the same passage also said to have sprung from the sap (rasa) of the Gāyatrī. There is no clear reference to Catechu having been prepared from its core, 7) It is called bahu-sāra, ‘of great strength,’ in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 4, 9. as it was later. The core (sāra) was used for making amulets. 8) Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 8. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 58, 58.

khadyota|खद्योत
ख-द्योत<BR> (‘sky-illuminator’), ‘the firefly,’ is mentioned in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (vi. 7, 3. 5).

khanitra|खनित्र
खनित्र,<BR> a ‘shovel’ or ‘spade’ for digging, is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 179, 6 (possibly metaphorical: see Oldenberg. Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 172; the passage is obscure). and later. 2) Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 2, 4, etc.

khanitrima|खनित्रिम
खनित्रिम,<BR> ‘produced by digging,’ as an epithet of āpaḥ, ‘waters,’ clearly refers to artificial water channels used for irrigation, as practised in the times of the Rigveda 1) vii. 49, 2. and the Atharvaveda. 2) i. 6, 4; xix. 2, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 466.

khara|खर
खर,<BR> ‘ass,’ is mentioned in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 1) iii. 2, 4. where a team of asses is alluded to. Probably the passages in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, 2) v. 1, 2, 15; xiv. 1, 2, 17; 2, 2, 30. where the word is used to denote an earth mound on which the sacrificial vessels were placed, presuppose the sense of ‘ass,’ the mound being shaped in this form. 3) Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 

khargalaa|खर्गला
खर्गला<BR> is an ‘owl’ or other nocturnal bird mentioned in one passage of the Rigveda. 1) vii. 104, 17. Cf. Kauśika Sūtra, 107; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93.

kharjuura|खर्जूर
खर्जूर<BR> is the name of a tree (Phœnix silvestris) which is mentioned in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 9, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 10; xxxvi. 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 63.

khala|खल
खल,<BR> the ‘threshing-floor,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) x. 48, 7; Nirukta, iii. 10. and the Atharvaveda. 2) xi. 3, 9; khala-ja, ‘produced on a threshing-floor,’ viii. 6, 15; khalya, ‘being on a threshing-floor,’ Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238. See Kṛṣi.

khalakula|खलकुल
खल-कुल<BR> is a word occurring in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 1) vi. 3. 22 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 3, 13 Kāṇva). Cf. Weber, Indische Studien 1, 355. where Sāyaṇa glosses it by Kulattha, a kind of pulse (Dolichos uniflorus).

khalva|खल्व
खल्व<BR> is some sort of grain or leguminous plant, perhaps, as Weber 1) Indische Studien, 1, 355. thinks, the Phaselus radiatus. It is mentioned with other grains of all sorts in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 2) xviii. 12, where Mahīdhara glosses it by caṇaka, ‘chick-pea.’ and as being crushed with the Dṛṣad in the Atharvaveda. 3) ii. 31. 1; v. 23, 8. It occurs also in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 4) vi. 3. 22 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 3, 13 Kāṇva). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 241. where Śaṅkara glosses it with niṣpāva.

khaaNDava|खाण्डव
खाण्डव<BR> is mentioned in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 1) v. 1, 1. as one of the boundaries of Kurukṣetra. There seems no reason to doubt its identity with the famous Khāṇḍava forest of the Mahābhārata. The name occurs also in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 2) xxv. 3, 6. and the Śāṭyāyanaka. 3) Max Müller, Ṛgveda, ^2 iv. ci. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 78. 

khaadi|खादि
खादि<BR> occurs frequently in the Rigveda denoting either anklets 1) v. 54, 11, and perhaps 53, 4. or armlets, 2) This is what Khādis on the shoulders must mean, i. 166, 9; vii. 56, 13. or sometimes rings on the hands. 3) i. 168, 3; khādi-hasta, ‘with rings on the hands,’ 5, 58, 2. So Roth takes Khādin in vi. 16, 40; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Khādin occurs also in ii. 34, 2; x. 38, 1. Max Müller 4) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 120, 230. considers that the word means quoits, the later Cakra. 5) Cf. vṛṣa-khādi, Rv. i. 64, 10. The rings were sometimes of gold. 6) Hiraṇya-khādi, Śāṅkhāyana Śranta Sūtra, iii. 5, 12; viii. 23, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 262; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 149.

khaarii|खारी
खारी<BR> designates a measure of Soma in one passage of the Rigveda. 1) iv. 32, 17. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 280.

khaargali|खार्गलि
खार्गलि,<BR> ‘descendant of Khargalā or Khṛgala,’ is the metronymic or patronymic of Luśākapi. 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxx. 2; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 4, 3.

khila|खिल
1. Khila, 1) Av. vii. 115, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, viii. 3, 4, 1. Khilya 2) Rv. vi. 28, 2; x. 142, 3. appear to have the same meaning. According to Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. So Whitney on Av., loc. cit. these terms denote the waste land lying between cultivated fields; but he admits that this sense does not suit the passage of the Rigveda 4) vi. 28, 2. in which it is said that the god places the worshipper on an unbroken Khilya (abhinne khilye), and he accordingly conjectures the reading akhilyabhinne, ‘land unbroken by barren strips.’ Pischel 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 205. thinks that the meaning intended is broad lands, which were used for the pasturing of the cattle of the community, and were not broken up by cultivated fields. Oldenberg, 6) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 385, 386. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236; Ludwig. Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 499; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiutic Society, 1910, 228. however, points out that the sense is rather the land which lay between cultivated fields, but which need not be deemed to have been unfertile, as Roth thought. This agrees with the fact that in Vedic times separate fields were already known: see Kṣetra. 

khila|खिल
2. Khila as a designation of certain hymns appended to the received text of the Rigveda occurs only in the Sūtra period. 1) See Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 16 et seq. The term is a metaphorical application of the preceding word, ‘a space not filled up,’ ‘a supplement.’

khRgala|खृगल
खृगल,<BR> or, as the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 9. 3. has it, Khugila, is an obscure expression found in two passages only--once in the Rigveda, 2) ii. 39, 4. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 340; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 98. and once in the Atharvaveda. 1) iii. 9. 3. In the former the meaning ‘crutch’ seems required; in the latter Sāyaṇa glosses it by ‘armour’ (tanu-trāṇa), but the sense is quite uncertain.

khela|खेल
खेल<BR> occurs in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 116, 15. where Pischel 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 171-173. considers that a god, Vivasvant, is meant, and that races were run in his honour, explaining thus the phrase ājā khelasya, as ‘in the race of Khela.’ Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. thinks that a man is meant, and Sieg, 4) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 127, 128. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 4. 28. following Sāyaṇa, sees in him a king whose Purohita was Agastya. See also Aṃśu. G.

gangaa|गङ्गा
गङ्गा,<BR> the modern Ganges, is mentioned directly in the Rigveda only once, in the Nadī-stuti or ‘Praise of Rivers.’ 1) x. 75, 5. But it is also referred to in the derivative form gāṅgyaḥ as an epithet of Urukakṣa. 3) The reference to the Gaṅgā remains, even if with Oldenberg (ṚgvedaNoten, 1, 396) we assume that a thicket i meant, and not a proper name (cf. Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 2, 288). See also Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1898, 563, n. 1. The name of this river does not occur 2) vi. 45, 31. in the other Saṃhitā, but appears in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 4) xiii. 5, 4, 11. The victory on the Gaṅgā represents the farthest extent of Bharata or Kuru rule. Cf. Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 23, and a verse in the Vaitāna Sūtra, xxxiv. 9, where the Sarasvatī is also referred to. where victories of Bharata Dauḥṣanti on both Gaṅgā and Yamunā are referred to, and in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 5) ii. 20. especial honour is assigned to those who dwell between the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā, this being. To doubt, the region in which that text originated. The identification of the Gaṅgā with the Apayā 6) Rv. iii. 23, 4. made by Ludwig 7) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 4. 5. must be rejected: see Āpayā.

gaja|गज
गज,<BR> the common name of the elephant in Epic 1) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 265, 269. and later Sanskrit, is only found in the late Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa. 2) Indische Studien, 1, 39. See Hastin.

gaNaka|गणक
गणक,<BR> ‘an astrologer,’ occurs in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha, or human sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 20; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 15, 1. Cf. Weber. Indische Streifen, 1, 78. See also Nakṣatradarśa.

gandharvaayaNabaaleya|गन्धर्वायणबालेय
गन्धर्वायण बालेय<BR> (‘descendant of Bali’) Āgniveśya is mentioned as a Pañcāla in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xx. 25).

gandhaara|गन्धार
गन्धार<BR> is a later form of the name of the people called Gandhāri in the Rigveda and Atharvaveda. In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1) vi. 14, 1. 2. See Oldenberg, Buddha, 399, n.; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 219, n. On the other hand, Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 15. 106, thought the passage meant that the Gandhāras were near the writer. the Gandhāras are referred to as being distant from the writer. See also Gāndhāra. 

gandhaari|गन्धारि
गन्धारि<BR> is the name of a people in the north-west of India. In the Rigveda 1) i. 126, 7. the good wool of the sheep of the Gandhāris is referred to. The Gandhāris are also mentioned with the Mūjavants, Angas, and Magadhas in the Atharvaveda. 2) v. 22, 14. The latter two tribes are apparently the Eastern limit of the poet's knowledge, the two former the Northern. Gandhāris 3) Hiraṇyakeśi Śrauta Sūtra, xvii. 6; Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, xxii. 6, 18. or Gāndhāris 4) Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxi. 13. are also spoken of in the Śrauta Sūtras. 5) See Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 56, 553. Zimmer 6) Altindisches Leben, 30, 31. considers that they were settled in Vedic times on the south bank of the Kubhā up to its mouth in the Indus, and for some distance down the east side of the Indus itself. They later formed a portion of the Persian empire, and detachments of Gandarians accompanied Xerxes in his expedition against Greece. 7) Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 23. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 206.

gabhasti|गभस्ति
गभस्ति<BR> denotes, according to Roth, 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. the pole of a chariot in the epithet syūma-gabhasti, ‘having reins as a pole,’ used of the car of the gods in the Rigveda, 2) i. 122, 5; vii. 71, 3. and independently in the plural in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 3) ii. 7, 13, 4. The meaning is, however, doubtful. 4) See Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 55. Roth 5) Op. cit., s.v. himself suggests that syūma-gabhasti may refer to a sort of double reins.

gaya|गय
1. Gaya, ‘house,’ is a common word in the Rigveda, 1) i. 74, 2; v. 10, 3; 44, 7; vi. 2, 8, etc. and sometimes occurs later. 2) Av. vi. 3, 3; 84, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxvii. 3. As its sense includes the inmates as well as their belongings, it is equivalent to ‘household.’

gayaplaata|गयप्लात
2. Gaya Plāta (‘son of Plati’) is referred to in the Rigveda, 1) x. 63, 17; 64, 17 (as son of Plati). two hymns of which he clearly claims to have composed, and which are attributed to him in the Sarvānukramaṇī and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 2) v. 2. In the Atharvaveda 3) i. 14, 4. Cf. also the Khila after Rv. v. 51, 15; Indische Studien, 3, 214. he appears with Asita and Kaśyapa as a half-mythical magician. 4) Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 17, 403. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 133; Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 460.

gara|गर
1. Gara, ‘poison,’ is referred to in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 18, 13. Cf. gara alone, Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xix. 4, 2 (see Indische Studien, 1, 33); Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, i. 9, 10; gara-gir, ‘poisoned,’ Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 1, 9; xix. 4, 2. 10. in the compound gara-gīrṇa, ‘poisoned.’ In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) xi. 5, 8, 6. it means simply a ‘fluid.’

gara|गर
2. Gara is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) ix. 2, 16. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 52. as the author of a Sāman or Chant, and as a friend of Indra.

garga|गर्ग
गर्ग<BR> is the name of a sage who is not mentioned in any of the Saṃhitās, 1) The authorship of Rv. vi. 47 is attributed to Garga Bhāradvāja in the Anukramaṇī. but his descendants, the Gargāḥ Prāvareyāḥ, are referred to in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 2) xiii. 12. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 374. Garga himself does not occur till the Sūtra period. 3) Garga-trirātra, Garga-tryaha, a three-night or three-day feast of Garga. See Āśvalāyana Srauta Sūtra, x. 2; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 22. 2; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxiii. 2, 8.

gargara|गर्गर
गर्गर,<BR> apparently the designation of a musical instrument, is mentioned once in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 69, 9. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 144, n. 1; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 289.

garta|गर्त
गर्त<BR> in the Rigveda 1) vi. 20, 9. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 246, 247. Zimmer wrongly takes this passage to refer to standing in the car. See Hopkins. Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 238, 239; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 48, and cf. garta-sad, ‘sitting on the car seat,’ in Rv. ii. 33. 11. primarily denotes the seat of the chariot on which the archer sat. It seems to have been of considerable size, being described as bṛhant, 2) v. 62, 8; 68, 5. ‘large.’ The word then comes to denote the chariot 3) So probably in v. 62, 5; gartā-ruh, ‘mounting the chariot,’ in Rv. i. 124, 7; Nirukta, iii. 5, may refer merely to mounting the seat. The passage is obscure; see Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 22. itself, either really or metaphorically. 4) vii. 64, 4 (of the hymn).

gardabha|गर्दभ
गर्दभ,<BR> ‘the ass,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) iii. 53, 23. A car drawn by asses is referred to in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 9; see also Khara. as inferior to the horse. In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā he again appears as inferior to the horse, 2) v. 1, 2, 1. 2. but at the same time as the best bearer of burdens (bhāra-bhāritama) among animals. 3) v. 1, 5, 5. The same authority styles the ass dvi-retas, ‘having double seed,’ 4) v. 1, 5, 5; vii. 1, 1, 2; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 57, 4 (Oertel, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 177-180): of the Rāsabha, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 3, 1, 23. in allusion to his breeding with the mare as well as the she-ass. The smallness of the young of the ass, and his capacity for eating, are both referred to. 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 5, 5. The disagreeable cry of the animal is mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 6) viii. 6, 10. and in allusion to this the term ‘ass’ is applied opprobriously to a singer in the Rigveda. 7) i. 29, 5. A hundred asses are spoken of as a gift to a singer in a Vālakhilya hymn. 8) viii. 56, 3. The mule (aśvatara) is the offspring of an ass and a mare, the latter, like the ass, being called dviretas, 9) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 1, 2. 3; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1, 6; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 57, 4. ‘receiving double seed,’ for similar reasons. The male ass is often also termed Rāsabha. The female ass, Gardabhī, is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 10) x. 1, 4. and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 11) i. 4, 8. For other references to the ass as Gardabha, see Av. v. 31, 3; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 34; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5, 1, 9; xii. 7, 1, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 232, 233.

garmut|गर्मुत्
गर्मुत्<BR> is the name of a kind of wild bean mentioned in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 1) ii. 4, 4, 1. 2. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 2) x. 11. has the form Ganmut, which is probably a false reading. The adjective gārmuta, ‘made from the Garmut bean,’ is found in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā. 3) ii. 2, 4. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71.

galunta|गलुन्त
गलुन्त<BR> is a word occurring only once in the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 83, 3. apparently in the sense of ‘swelling,’ 2) Bloomfield, Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, October, 1887, xvi; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 505. but Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 343. translates it by ‘neck.’

galuunasaaarxaakaayaNa|गलूनसआर्क्षाकायण
गलूनस आर्क्षाकायण<BR> (‘descendant of Ṛkṣāka’) is mentioned as a teacher in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (i. 38, 4).

gavaya|गवय
गवय,<BR> the name of a species of ox (Bos gavacus) occurs frequently from the Rigveda 1) iv. 21, 8. onwards. 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 10; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvi. 17; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 28; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 8; iii. 34; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 3, 9; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 3, 14, etc. It is mentioned with Gaura and Mahiṣa in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 3) xxiv. 28. where also a wild Gavaya is spoken of. 4) xiii. 49; Taittirīya Samhitā, iv. 2, 10, 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 7, 17; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvi. 17. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83, 84.

gavaashir|गवाशिर्
गवाशिर्,<BR> ‘mixed with milk,’ is a frequent epithet of Soma in the Rigveda. 1) i. 137, 1; 187, 9; ii. 41, 3; iii. 32, 2; 42, 1. 7; viii. 52, 10; 101, 10. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 279. 

gaviShTi|गविष्टि
गव्-इष्टि<BR> (lit. ‘desire of cows’) in several passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 91, 23; iii. 47, 4; v. 63, 5; vi. 31, 3; 47, 20; 59, 7; viii. 24, 2; ix. 76, 2. So Av. iv. 24, 5. denotes ‘conflict’ or ‘battle,’ evidently with reference to cattle raids. Gavyā 2) Rv. vii. 18, 7. is similarly used.

gaviShThiraaatreya|गविष्ठिरआत्रेय
गवि-ष्ठिर आत्रेय<BR> (‘descendant of Atri’) is mentioned as a Ṛṣi, or seer, in the Rigveda 1) v. 1, 12; x. 150, 5. and the Atharvaveda. 2) iv. 29, 5. See also Āśvalāyana Srauta Sūtra, xii. 14. 1. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 126.

gaviidhukaa|गवीधुका
गवीधुका,<BR> 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 4, 3, 2. Gavedhukā, 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 4, 13; 3, 1, 10; xiv. 1, 2, 19. is the name of a species of grass (Coix barbata). It is also referred to in the adjectival forms gāvīdhuka 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 7, 1; 9, 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 3, 6; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 5; iv. 3, 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xv. 5. and gāvedhuka. 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 4, 11. 13; 3, 1, 10; 3, 7.

gavya|गव्य
गव्य<BR> See Gavyūti.

gavyaa|गव्या
गव्या<BR> See Gaviṣṭi.

gavyuuti|गव्यूति
गव्यूति<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 25, 16; iii. 62, 16; v. 66, 3; vii. 77, 4, etc. means, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. grass land for the pasturing of cattle, in which sense Gavya is also found. 3) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 28; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3b. Thence it derives the sense of a measure of distance found in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 4) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 13, 12. Geldner, on the other hand, takes the original meaning to be ‘road,’ real 6) Rv. i. 25, 16. or metaphorical, 7) Rv. vi. 47, 20; x. 14, 2. thence a measure of distance, 8) Rv. viii. 60, 20, and n. 4. and finally ‘land.’ 9) Rv. iii. 62, 16; vii. 62, 5; 65, 4; viii. 5, 6. 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 290, 291. 

gaangya|गाङ्ग्य
गाङ्ग्य,<BR> ‘being on the Ganges,’ is the epithet of Urukakṣa 1) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 2, 288; Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 28. or of a thicket 2) Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 398. in the Rigveda. 3) vi. 45, 31. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 291, n.

gaangyaayani|गाङ्ग्यायनि
गाङ्ग्यायनि,<BR> ‘descendant of Gāṅgya,’ occurs as the patronymic of Citra in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad. 1) i. 1. There is a v.l. Gārgyāyaṇi. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 395.

gaatu|गातु
गातु<BR> See Gāthā.

gaathaa|गाथा
गाथा<BR> in the Rigveda 1) viii. 32, 1; 71, 14; 98, 9; ix. 99, 4; gātha, i. 167, 6; ix. 11, 4; gātha-pati, ‘lord of song,’ i. 43, 4; gāthā-nī, ‘leading a song,’ i. 190, 1; viii. 92, 2; ṛjugātha, ‘singing correctly,’ v. 44, 5; gāthin, ‘singer,’ i. 7, 1. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 65. usually means only ‘song,’ ‘verse,’ like Gātu. 2) i. 151, 2; ii. 20, 5; iii. 4, 4; iv. 4, 6; v. 87, 8; x. 20, 4; 122, 2. In one passage, 3) x. 85, 6. however, it already has a more special sense, as it is classed with Nārāśaṃsī and Raibhī, a collocation repeatedly found later. 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 11, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, Aśvamedha, v. 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 32; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxx. 5; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 6, 8, where Raibhī does not occur; Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 12. The commentators identify the three terms with certain verses of the Atharvaveda, 5) Viz., Gāthā = Av. xx. 127, 12 et seq.; Nārāśaṃsī = Av. xx. 127, 1-3; Raibhī = Av. xx. 127, 4-6; while ibid., 7-10, are known as Pārikṣityaḥ (scil., ṛcaḥ). but Oldenberg 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 238. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 689 et seq., seems to accept the identification even for the Rigveda. has shown that this identification is incorrect for the Rigveda. Gāthās are often mentioned elsewhere, 7) Av. x. 10, 20; xv. 6, 4 (distinct from Nārāśaṃsī); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 4, 16; xi. 5, 7, 10; xiii. 1, 5, 6; 4, 2, 8; 5, 4, 2; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 10 (distinct from Nārāśaṃsī); Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 17, 9, etc. and are referred to as metrical in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 8) ii. 3, 6, with Keith's note; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 7, 10. where the Ṛc, Kumbyā, and Gāthā are classed as forms of verse. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 9) vii. 18. The story of Śunaḥśepa is described as śata-gātham, ‘told in a hundred Gāthās.’ distinguishes between Ṛc and Gāthā as divine and human respectively. According to the usage of the Brāhmaṇas and the liturgical literature, as stated by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, the Gāthās are, though religious in content, distinguished from Ṛc, Yajus, and Sāman as nonVedic--that is, are not Mantras. This view is consistent with the fact that the phrase Yajña-gāthā, meaning a verse summarizing a sacrificial usage, is not rare. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10) xiii. 5, 4, etc., and see xiii. 4, 2, 8, where the Gāthās are plainly Dānastutis, or ‘praises of gifts,’ just as the Nārāśaṃsī verses are declared to be in the Bṛhaddevatā, iii. 154. preserves several Gāthās, which generally accord with this description as epitomizing the sacrifices of famous kings, and the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 11) iii. 7, 3. states that a Gāthā is sung at a wedding. Sometimes 12) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 2, 6. So Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 98, takes Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 6, 8, where Sāyaṇa hesitates between identifying the two and distinguishing them. It seems reasonable to regard Gāthā as the wider term which covers, but is not coextensive with, Nārāśaṃsī. Cf. Sāyaṇa's example of a Gāthā in his commentary on Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 3, 6: prātaḥ prātar anṛtaṃ te vadanti, ‘they every morning tell an untruth,’ which is clearly not a Nārāśaṃsī. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 689 et seq.; Weber, Episches im Vedischen Ritual, 4 et seq.; Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 493. Gāthā is qualified as Nārāśaṃsī, where it must be a eulogy of a generous donor.

gaathin|गाथिन्
गाथिन्<BR> is mentioned as the son of Kuśika and father of Viśvāmitra in the Sarvānukramaṇī. It is difficult to say whether this tradition is correct; it derives some support from the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (vii. 18), where reference is made to the divine lore (daiva veda) of the Gāthins, which is said to be shared by Śunaḥśepa as a result of his adoption by Viśvāmitra. See Gāthina.

gaathina|गाथिन
गाथिन<BR> --The sons of Viśvāmitra are described in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) vii. 18. Cf. Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, vii. 18; Weber, Episches im Vedischen Ritual, 16, n. 3. as Gāthinas, or descendants of Gāthin, who, according to tradition, was their grandfather; 2) Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 348 et seq.; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 32 et seq. and Viśvāmitra himself is styled Gāthina in the Sarvānukramaṇī. 

gaaMdama|गांदम
गां-दम<BR> is the form in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) xxi. 14, 20. of the name of Ekayāvan, which in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 2) ii. 7, 11, 2. Cf. Hopkins, Transac tions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 69. is read as Kāṃdama.

gaandhaara|गान्धार
गान्धार,<BR> ‘a king of Gandhāra’ named Nagnajit, is mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 1) vii. 34. in the list of teachers who handed down the knowledge of the substitute for Soma. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) viii. 1, 4, 10. he or some descendant figures as Svarjit Nāgnajita or Nagnajit, and as giving an opinion on the ritual, which is rejected with the observation that the author was merely a princely person (rājanya-bandhu).

gaargiivaachaknavii|गार्गीवाचक्नवी
गार्गी वाचक्नवी<BR> is referred to in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1) iii. 6, 1; 8, 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 118. as a female contemporary and rival of Yājñavalkya.

gaargiiputra|गार्गीपुत्र
गार्गी-पुत्र,<BR> ‘son of Gargī,’ occurs as the name of three teachers in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 4, 30). The earliest of these three was the pupil of Bāḍeyīputra and the teacher of the second Gārgīputra. The latter was the teacher of Pārāśarīkauṇḍinīputra, the teacher of the third Gārgīputra.

gaargya|गार्ग्य
गार्ग्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Garga,’ is the patronymic of Bālāki in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 1) ii. 1, 1. and the Kauṣītaki 2) iv. 1. Upaniṣads. Two Gārgyas are mentioned in the second Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad: 3) iv. 6, 2 (Kāṇva) one of them is the pupil of Gārgya, who again is the pupil of Gautama. Others occur in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 4) i. 7, 3. and in the Nirukta, 5) i. 3. 12; iii. 13. as well as later in the ritual Sūtras. Thus the family was evidently long connected with the development of liturgy and grammar. 

gaargyaayaNa|गार्ग्यायण
गार्ग्यायण,<BR> ‘descendant of Gārgya,’ is mentioned as a pupil of Uddālakāyana in the second Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (iv. 6, 2 Kāṇva).

gaargyaayaNi|गार्ग्यायणि
गार्ग्यायणि,<BR> ‘descendant of Gārgya,’ is a variant reading for Gāṅgyāyani as the patronymic of Citra in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad (i. 1).

gaalava|गालव
गालव<BR> is mentioned as a pupil of Vidarbhīkauṇḍinya in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 (Mādhyaṃdina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Kāṇva). It is possibly the same man that is referred to regarding a point of ritual in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka. 2) v. 3, 3. A grammarian of this name is mentioned in the Nirukta. 3) iv. 3. Cf. Pāṇini, vi. 3, 61; vii. 1, 74; 3, 99; viii. 4, 67.

giri|गिरि
गिरि,<BR> ‘mountain’ or ‘height,’ is a word that occurs repeatedly in the Rigveda. 1) i. 56, 3; 61, 14; 63, 1; iv. 20, 6; vi. 24, 8, etc. Thus reference is made to the trees on the hills, hence called ‘tree-haired’ (vṛkṣa-keśāḥ), 2) Rv. v. 41, 11. and to the streams proceeding from the hills to the sea (samudra). 3) Rv. vii. 95, 2. The term is frequently coupled with the adjectival parvata. 4) Rv. i. 56, 4; viii. 64, 5; Av. iv. 7, 8; vi. 12, 3; 17, 3; ix. 1, 18, etc. The Rigveda mentions the waters from the hills, 5) Rv. vi. 66, 11, on which passage, see Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 411; viii. 32, 4; x. 68, 1, etc. and the Atharvaveda 6) xii. 1, 11. See Himavant. refers to the snowy mountains. Actual names of mountains, as Mūjavant, Trikakud, Himavant, are very rare. References to Krauñca, Mahāmeru, and Maināga, are confined to the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, while Nāvaprabhraṃśana can no longer be considered a proper name. 7) Av. xix. 37, 8, with Whitney's note in his Translation; Macdonell, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1107. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 47.

girixitauchchaamanyava|गिरिक्षितौच्चामन्यव
गिरि-क्षित् औच्चा-मन्यव,<BR> ‘descendant of Uccāmanyu,’ is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (x. 5, 7) as a contemporary of Abhipratārin Kākṣaseṇi 

girijabaabhravya|गिरिजबाभ्रव्य
गिरि-ज बाभ्रव्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Babhru,’ is mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (vii. 1) as having been taught by Śrauta the method of dividing the sacrificial animal (paśor vibhakti).

guggulu|गुग्गुलु
गुग्गुलु,<BR> ‘bdellium,’ is referred to in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) xix. 38, 2. as produced by the Sindhu 2) Or ‘from streams’ (saindhava), as Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. guggulu, suggests. and by the sea. The latter source presumably alludes, as Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 28. assumes, to seaborne trade, bdellium being the gum of a tree, not a product of the sea. It is, however, possible that in this passage some other substance may be meant. The word in this form also occurs elsewhere in the Atharvaveda 4) ii. 36, 7. and later; 5) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 28. it is often 6) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 8, 6; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 8, 5; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxiv. 13; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 2, 16. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 675; Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 12, 339; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 957, 958. mentioned in the older form of Gulgulu, between which and Guggulu the manuscripts constantly vary

gungu|गुङ्गु
गुङ्गु<BR> --The descendants of Guṅgu are referred to as Guṅgus in a hymn of the Rigveda, 1) x. 48, 8. Cf. Ludwig. Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165. apparently as friends of Atithigva. Possibly a people may be meant.

gupta|गुप्त
गुप्त<BR> is the name in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 42) of Vaipaścita Dārḍhajayanti Gupta Lauhitya. All the three other names being patronymics show that he was descended from the families of Vipaścit, Dṛḍhajayanta, and Lohita.

gulgulu|गुल्गुलु
गुल्गुलु<BR> See Guggulu.

gRtsamada|गृत्समद
गृत्स-मद<BR> is the name of a seer to whom the Sarvānukramaṇī attributes the authorship of the second Maṇḍala of the Rigveda. This tradition is supported by the Aitareya Brāh maṇa 1) v. 2, 4. and the Aitareya Araṇyaka. 2) ii. 2, 1. The Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 3) xxii. 4. Cf. Gārtsamadī, xxviii. 2. speaks of him as a Bhārgava, ‘descendant of Bhṛgu,’ with a variant Bābhrava, ‘descendant of Babhru,’ but the later tradition keeps to the former patronymic. 4) Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 226 et seq. The Gṛtsamadas are often mentioned in the second Maṇḍala of the Rigveda, 5) ii. 4, 9; 19, 8; 39, 8; 41, 18. and are also called Śunahotras, 6) ii. 18, 6; 41, 14. 17. but never Gārtsamadas or Śaunahotras, and Gṛtsamada himself never occurs there. 7) Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 200, 201. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 118; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 287.

gRdhra|गृध्र
गृध्र,<BR> ‘the vulture,’ is often mentioned from the Rigveda 1) i. 118, 4; ii. 39, 1; vii. 104, 22; x. 123, 8. downwards. 2) Av. vii. 95, 1; xi. 2, 2; 9, 9; 10. 8. 24; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 7, 1; v. 5, 20, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 9, 19; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iv. 29; Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa in Indische Studien, 1, 40; etc. The swiftness of its flight 3) Rv. ii. 39, 1. and its fondness for devouring carrion are especially noticed. 4) Av. xi. 10, 8. 24; Maitrāyaṃ Saṃhitā, loc. cit. More generally the word is used to designate any bird of prey, the eagle (Śyena) being classed as the chief of the Gṛdhras. 5) Rv. ix. 96, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 88; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 225.

gRShTi|गृष्टि
गृष्टि,<BR> ‘a young cow,’ which has only calved once, occurs in the Rigveda 1) iv. 18, 10. and the Atharvaveda, 2) ii. 13, 3; viii. 9, 24; xix. 24, 5. as well as in the later Sūtra literature. 3) Kauśika Sūtra, 19. 24, etc.

gRha|गृह
गृह<BR> is used in the singular, 1) Rv. iii. 53, 6; iv. 49, 6; viii. 10. 1, etc.; Av. vii. 83, 1; x. 6, 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 21. or oftener in the plural, 2) Rv. ii. 42, 3; v. 76, 4; x. 18, 12; 85, 26; 142, 4; 165, 2; Av. i. 27, 4; iii. 10, 11; vi. 137, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 31; viii. 26; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ii. 32; iv. 33; xviii. 44; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 22; 6, 1, 19, etc. to denote the ‘house’ of the Vedic Indian. Dama or Dam has the same sense, while Pastyā and Harmya denote more especially the home with its surroundings, the family settlement. The house held not only the family, which might be of considerable size, but also the cattle 3) Rv. vii. 56, 16; Av. i. 3, 4; ix. 3, 13. and the sheep 4) Rv. x. 106, 5; Av. iii. 3. at night. It was composed of several rooms, as the use of the plural indicates, and it could be securely shut up. 5) Rv. vii. 85, 6. The door (Dvār, Dvāra) is often referred to, and from it the house is called Duroṇa. In every house the fire was kept burning. 6) Rv. i. 69, 2. Cf. the Gārhapatya Agni, Av. v. 31, 5; vi. 120, 1; 121, 2; viii. 102; ix. 6, 30; xii. 2, 34; xviii. 4, 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. iii. 39; xix. 18; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 6. 12; Kauṣīt taki Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 6, 1, 28; vii. 1, 1, 6, etc. Very little is known of the structure of the house. Presumably stone was not used, 7) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 153. Muir's view, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 461, that clay was used can only apply to the minor finishing of the walls of a house. and houses were, as in Megasthenes' time, 8) Arrian, Indica, x. 2. built of wood. The hymns of the Atharvaveda 9) iii. 12; ix. 3. See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 343 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 234 et seq.; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 525 et seq. give some information about the construction of a house, but the details are extremely obscure, for most of the expressions used do not recur in any context in which their sense is clear. According to Zimmer, 10) Op. cit., 153. No certainty can attach to the rendering of the words. four pillars (Upamit) were set up on a good site, and against them beams were leant at an angle as props (Pratimit). The upright pillars were connected by cross beams (Parimit) resting upon them. The roof was formed of ribs of bamboo cane (vaṃśa), 11) It seems likely that, as the ribs were of bamboo and were probably fixed in the ridge, the roof was wagon headed, like the huts of the Todas at the present day (see illustrations in Rivers, The Todas, pp. 25, 27, 28, 51), and the rock-cut Chaityas, or Assembly Halls, of the Buddhists in Western India, in some of the earliest of which the wooden ribs of the arched roof are still preserved. See Fergusson, History of Indian Architecture, 22, 135, cf. 126. a ridge called Viṣūvant, and a net (Akṣu), which may mean a thatched covering 12) Av. ix. 3, 8, where Bloomfield, op. cit., 598, thinks of a wickerwork roof; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 136, of a pole with countless holes. over the bamboo ribs. The walls were filled up with grass in bundles (palada), and the whole structure was held together with ties of various sorts (nahana, prāṇāha, saṃdaṃśa, pariṣvañjalya). 13) Av. ix. 3, 4. 5. In connexion with the house, mention is made of four terms which, though primarily sacrificial in meaning, seem to designate parts of the building: Havirdhāna, ‘oblation-holder’; Agniśāla, 14) Zimmer conjecturally identifies the Agniśāla with the central room, the Havirdhāna with a place for keeping the grain, etc. (e.g., Av. iii. 3, 4), the Patnīnāṃ Sadana with the women's apartments, and the Sadas with the subsidiary buildings. ‘fireplace’; Patnīnāṃ Sadana, ‘wives’ room’; and Sadas, ‘sitting room.’ Slings or hanging vessels (Śikya) are also mentioned. 15) Av. ix. 3, 6. See Whitney, op. cit., 526; Bloomfield, op. cit., 597. Reedwork (iṭa) is spoken of, no doubt as part of the finishing of the walls of the house. 16) Av. ix. 3, 17. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 148-156. The sides are called Pakṣa. The door with its framework was named Ātā.

gRhapa|गृहप
गृह-प<BR> 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 11. or Gṛha-pati 2) Rv. vi. 53, 2; Av. xiv. 1, 51; xix. 31, 13; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 6, 8, 5; viii. 6, 1, 11, and repeatedly as an epithet of Agni, Rv. i. 12, 6; 36, 5; 60, 4; vi. 48, 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ii. 27; iii. 39; ix. 39; xxiv. 24, etc. is the regular name, from the Rigveda onwards, of the householder as master of the house. Similarly the mistress is called Gṛha-patnī. 3) Rv. x. 85, 26; Av. iii. 24, 6. Cf Gārhapatya, Rv. i. 15, 12; vi. 15, 19 x. 85, 27. 36. For the powers and position of the Gṛhapati see Pitṛ.

gRhya|गृह्य
गृह्य<BR> denotes the members of the house or family in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) ii. 5, 2, 14; 3, 16; 6, 2, 4; iii. 4, 1, 6; xii. 4, 1, 4. Cf. gṛhāḥ, i. 7, 4; 12.

gairixita|गैरिक्षित
गैरि-क्षित,<BR> ‘descendant of Girikṣit,’ is the patronymic of Trasadasyu in the Rigveda, 1) v. 33, 8; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155, 174. and of the Yaskas in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 2) xiii. 12; Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 474, 475.

go|गो
1. Go (a), ‘ox’ or ‘cow.’ 1) i. 83, 1; 135, 8; ii. 23, 18, etc.; gāva ukṣaṇaḥ, i. 168, 2; Av. iii. 11, 8; Vājasaṇeyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 20; gāvo dhenavaḥ, Rv. i. 173. 1; vi. 45. 28; x. 95, 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 19. etc. These were among the chief sources of wealth to the Vedic Indian, and are repeatedly referred to from the Rigveda onwards. 2) The five sacrificial animals are man, goat, sheep, ox, horse, Sāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ix. 23, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 3, 13; iii. 1, 2, 13; iv. 5, 5, 10; xiv. 1, 1, 32. The milk (Kṣīra) was either drunk fresh or made into butter (Ghṛta) or curds (Dadhi), or was mixed with Soma or used for cooking with grain (Kṣīraudana). The cows were milked thrice a day, early (prātar-doha), in the forenoon (Saṃgava), and in the evening (sāyaṃ-doha). 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 3, 1. Thrice a day they were driven out to graze, according to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 4) i. 4, 9, 2. The exact sense of this notice is obscure. Strictly speaking the cows were driven out from the cattleshed in the morning, spent the heat of the day in the Saṃgavinī, were then driven out during the evening to graze, and finally came or were driven home, as is often mentioned: Rv. i. 66, 5; 149, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xv. 41. (prātaḥ, saṃgave, sāyam). The first milking was productive, the last two scanty. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 3, 1. According to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 5) iii. 18, 14. among the Bharatas the herds in the evening are in the Goṣṭha, at midday in the Saṃgavīnī. This passage Sāyaṇa expands by saying that the herds go home to the Śālā, or house for animals, at night so far as they consist of animals giving milk, while the others stayed out in the Goṣṭha, or open pasturage; but both were together in the cattle-shed during the heat of the day. The time before the Saṃgava, when the cows were grazing freely on the pastureland, was called Svasara. 6) Rv. ii. 2, 2; 34, 8; v. 62, 2; viii. 88, 1; ix. 94, 2. The going of the cows to their pasture in the morning is often referred to--e.g., Rv. i. 25, 16; x. 97, 8. When the cows were out feeding they were separated from the calves, which were, however, allowed to join them at the Saṃgava, 7) Rv. ii. 2, 2; viii. 88, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 1, 3; Śankara on Chāndogya Upaniṣad, ii. 9, 4; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 12, 4; Nārāyaṇa on Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iii. 12, 2. and sometimes in the evening. 8) Gobhila Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 8, 7; Rv. ii. 2, 2. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 111-114. While grazing the cattle were under the care of a herdsman (Gopā, Gopāla) armed with a goad, 9) Pavīravān, Rv. x. 60, 3, is probably so meant. The usual name was Aṣṭrā, the significant mark of a Vaiśya. Cf. Rv. vii. 33, 6. but they were liable to all sorts of dangers, such as being lost, falling into pits, breaking limbs, 10) Rv. i. 120, 8; vi. 54, 5-7. Also Pūṣan was the special deity expected to guard cattle, and hence is called anaṣṭapaśu, ‘losing no kine.’ See Rv. x. 17, 2. and Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 36. and being stolen. The marking of the ears of cattle was repeatedly adopted, no doubt, to indicate ownership. 11) Rv. vi. 28, 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 9, and cf. Aṣṭakarṇī and Svadhiti. Large herds of cattle were well-known, as is shown by the Dānastutis, or ‘praises of gifts,’ in the Rigveda, 12) Rv. viii. 5, 37, etc. Cf. Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 14, 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 21. 23; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 8 et seq. even when allowances are made for the exaggeration of priestly gratitude. The importance attached to the possession of cattle is shown 13) Rv. i. 43, 2; 162, 22; v. 4, 11; ix. 9, 9, etc.; Av. i. 31, 4; ii. 26, 4; v. 29, 2; vi. 68, 3; viii. 7, 11; x. 1, 17. 29; xi. 2, 9. 21, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 3, 1; v. 5, 5, 1; vi. 5, 10, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 59. by the numerous passages in which the gods are asked to prosper them, and by the repeated prayers 14) Rv. i. 83, 1; iv. 32, 17; v. 4, 11; viii. 89, 2, etc. for wealth in kine. Hence, too, forays for cattle (Gaviṣṭi) were well known; the Bharata host is called the ‘horde desiring cows’ (gavyan grāmaḥ) in the Rigveda; 15) iii. 33, 11. and a verbal root gup, 16) Rv. vii. 103, 9; Av. x. 9, 7, 8; xix. 27, 9. 10. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 358, n. 13 ‘to protect,’ was evolved as early as the Rigveda from the denominative go-pāya, ‘to guard cows.’ The Vedic poets 17) Rv. vii. 32, 22; viii. 95, 1; 106, 1; ix. 12, 2, etc. do not hesitate to compare their songs with the lowing of cows, or to liken the choir of the singing Apsarases to cows. 18) Rv. x. 95, 6. It is, however, uncertain whether the names of Apsarases are meant in this passage. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 517. The cattle of the Vedic period were of many colours: red (rohita), light (śukra), dappled (pṛśni), even black (kṛṣṇa). 19) Rv. i. 62, 9. Various other colours are mentioned in the lists of animals at the Aśvamedha, or human sacrifice, in the Yajurveda, but apparently as exceptional. Zimmer 20) Altindisches Leben, 226. sees a reference to cows with blazes on the face in one passage of the Rigveda, 21) i. 87, 1. It is also rendered as ‘the heavens with stars.’ but this is uncertain. Oxen were regularly used for ploughing or for drawing wagons (anaḍvāh), in which case they were, it seems, usually castrated. 22) Av. iii. 9, 2; vi. 138, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8. 9, 1; Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 151, n. See Mahāniraṣṭa. Cows were not properly used for drawing carts, hough they at times did so. 23) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 4, 13. The flesh of both cows and bulls was sometimes eaten (Māmsa). Cattle were certainly the objects of individual ownership, and they formed one of the standards of exchange and valuation (see Kraya). (b) The term Go is often applied to express the products of the cow. It frequently means the milk, 1) Rv. i. 33, 10; 151, 8; 181, 8; ii. 30, 7; iv. 27, 5; ix. 46, 4; 71, 5. but rarely the flesh 2) Rv. x. 16, 7 (in the funeral ritual). of the animal. In many passages it designates leather used as the material of various objects, as a bowstring, 3) Rv. vi. 75, 11; x. 27, 22; Av. i. 2, 3. or a sling, 4) Rv. i. 121, 9. or thongs to fasten part of the chariot, 5) Rv. vi. 47, 26; viii. 59. 5. or reins, 6) Rv. vi. 46, 14. or the lash of a whip. 7) Rv. vi. 53. 9. See also Carman, with which Go is sometimes synonymous. 8) Rv. x. 94. 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 228 (c) Gāvaḥ means the stars of heaven in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 154, 6; vii. 36, 1. according to Roth. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 5.

goaangirasa|गोआङ्गिरस
2. Go Āṅgirasa (‘descendant of Aṅgiras’) is the reputed author of a Sāman or Chant in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xvi. 7, 7. Cf. Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, vi. 11, 3. There is little doubt that he is mythical. 2) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 68.

goghaata|गोघात
गो-घात,<BR> ‘a cow-killer,’ is enumerated in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha, or human sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 18; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 16, 1. See Māṃsa.

gotama|गोतम
गोतम<BR> is mentioned several times in the Rigveda, 1) Rv. i. 62, 13; 78, 2; 84, 5; 85, 11; iv. 4, 11. but never in such a way as to denote personal authorship of any hymn. 2) Oldenberg. Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 215. It seems clear that he was closely connected with the Aṅgirases, for the Gotamas frequently refer to Aṅgiras. 3) Cf. Rv. i. 62, 1; 71, 2; 74, 5; 75, 2; 78, 3; iv. 2, 5; 16, 8, etc. That he bore the patronymic Rāhūgaṇa is rendered probable by one hymn of the Rigveda, 4) Rv. i. 78, 5. Cf. Oldenberg, loc. cit., 236, n. 1. and is assumed in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 5) i. 4, 1, 10 et seq.; xi. 4, 3, 20. The former passage is wrongly cited by Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 81, 3. See Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 9, n. where he appears as the Purohita, or domestic priest, of Māthava Videgha, and as a bearer of Vedic civilization. He is also mentioned in the same Brāhmaṇa 6) xi. 4, 3, 20. as a contemporary of Janaka of Videha, and Yājñavalkya, and as the author of a Stoma. 7) xiii. 5, 1, 1; Āśvalāvana Śrauta Sūtra, ix. 5, 6; 10, 8, etc. He occurs, moreover, in two passages of the Atharvaveda. 8) iv. 29, 6; xviii. 3, 16. See also Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa in Indische Studien, 1, 38; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 2, 6. The Gotamas are mentioned in several passages of the Rigveda, 9) i. 60, 5; 61, 16; 63, 9; 77, 5; 78, 1; 88, 4; 92, 7; iv. 32, 9. 12; viii. 88, 4. Cf. Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 10. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 110, 123; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 170, 180; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 151, 152. Vāmadeva and Nodhas being specified as sons of Gotama. They include the Vājaśravases. See also Gautama.

gotamiiputra|गोतमीपुत्र
गोतमी-पुत्र,<BR> ‘son of Gotamī,’ is mentioned as a pupil of Bhāradvājī-putra in the Kāṇva recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 5, 1). See also Gautamī-putra.

gotra|गोत्र
गोत्र<BR> occurs several times in the Rigveda 1) i. 51, 3; ii. 17, 1; 23, 18; iii. 39, 4; 43, 7; viii. 74, 5; x. 48, 2; 103, 7. in the account of the mythic exploits of Indra. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. interprets the word as ‘cowstall,’ while Geldner 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 275, 276, where he divides the passages according as real or mythical herds are meant. thinks ‘herd’ is meant. The latter sense seems to explain best the employment which the term shows in the later literature as denoting the ‘family’ or ‘clan,’ and which is found in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 4) iv. 4, 1. So Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra; i. 4, 16, etc.; Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 4, etc.; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 15. In the Gṛhya Sūtras 5) Gobhila Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 4, 4; Āpastamba Dharma Sūtra, ii. 5, 11, 15. 16, in Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 387. For sapiṇḍa, see Gautama Dharma Sūtra, xiv. 13; Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, iv. 17-19. stress is laid on the prohibition of marriage within a Gotra, or with a Sapiṇḍa of the mother of the bridegroom--that is to say, roughly, with agnates and cognates. Senart 6) Les Castes dans l'Inde, 210 et seq. Cf. De la Vallée Poussin, Le Védisme, 15. has emphasized this fact as a basis of caste, on the ground that marriage within a curia, phratria, or caste (Varṇa) was Indo-European, as was marriage outside the circle of agnates and cognates. But there is no evidence at all 7) Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 471, 472. to prove that this practice was Indo-European, while in India the Śatapatha 8) i. 8, 3, 6. expressly recognizes marriage within the third or fourth degree on either side. According to Sāyaṇa, the Kāṇvas accepted marriage in the third degree, the Saurāṣṭras only in the fourth, while the scholiast on the Vajrasūcī 9) See Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 73-76. adḍs to the Kāṇvas the Andhras and the Dākṣiṇātyas, and remarks that the Vājasaneyins forbade marriage with the daughter of the mother's brother. All apparently allowed marriage with the daughter of a paternal uncle, which later was quite excluded. Change of Gotra was quite possible, as in the case of Śunaḥśepa and Gṛtsamada, who, once an Aṅgirasa, became a Bhārgava. 10) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 157; Festgruss an Roth, 108. Cf. Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 61 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 323.

godaana|गोदान
गो-दान<BR> appears to mean ‘the whiskers’ in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) iii. 1, 2, 5, 6. where the person, being consecrated, first shaves off the right and then the left ‘whisker.’ Later on the Godānavidhi, or ceremony of shaving the head, is a regular part of the initiation of a youth on the attainment of manhood and on marriage; 2) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 19; Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 28, etc. but though the ceremony is recognized in the Atharvaveda, 3) vi. 68. See Kauśika Sūtra, liii. 1720. But Av. ii. 13 is not to be classed here as in the Kauśika; it refers to the giving of a new garment to a child, and the removal of its first wrap. See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 56, 57, correcting Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 173, and Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 322, 323. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 306, 574, 665. the name 4) The meaning ‘whisker’ is a secondary one, derived, doubtless, from the ‘gift of a cow’ (go-dāna), accompanying the ceremony of shaving the whiskers or hair. does not occur there. 

godhaa|गोधा
गोधा<BR> --(a) The sense of ‘bowstring’ seems certain in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 28, 10. 11. and possible in another. 2) viii. 69, 9. See Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 53. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1. also adopts this meaning in the only passage of the Atharvaveda 4) iv. 3, 6. where the word occurs. (b) In one passage of the Rigveda 1) viii. 69, 9. the sense of ‘musical instrument’ is recognized by Roth and by Hillebrandt 2) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 144, n. 1. for this word. (c) Elsewhere 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 15, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 35; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ix. 2, 14; Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ii. 5; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 221; Śāṭyāyanaka in Sāyaṇa on Rv. viii. 91; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 29. an animal seems to be meant, perhaps the ‘crocodile,’ as Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 499. and Weber 3) Indische Studien, 18, 15, 16. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 368, renders the word vaguely by ‘dragon.’ think; perhaps a large ‘lizard,’ as Roth and Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 95. assume. An animal is probably also meant in the Atharvaveda. 5) iv. 3, 6, where Whitney offers no rendering at all.

godhuuma|गोधूम
गो-धूम,<BR> ‘wheat,’ is frequently referred to in the plural in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 2, 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 12; xix. 22. 89; xxi. 29, etc. and Brāhmaṇas, 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 7, 1, 2; 2, 9; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 3, 22 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 3, 13 Kāṇva), etc. and is expressly distinguished from ‘rice’ (Vrīhi) or ‘barley’ (Yava). 3) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 7, 2. ‘Groats’ (saktavaḥ) made of this grain are also mentioned. 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 9, 1, 5. The word occurs in the singular in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 5) v. 2, 1, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 241.

gopati|गोपति
गो-पति,<BR> ‘lord of cows,’ is freely used in the Rigveda 1) i. 101, 4; iv. 24, 1; vi. 45, 21; vii. 18, 4, etc. Av. iii. 14, 6, etc. to denote any lord or master, a natural usage considering that cattle formed the main species of wealth. 

gopavana|गोपवन
गोप-वन<BR> is the name of a poet of the race of Atri in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 74, 11. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 215; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 107. See Gaupavana.

gopaa|गोपा
गो-पा<BR> and Go-pāla, ‘protector of cows,’ occur in the Rigveda 1) Gopā: Rv. i. 164, 21; ii. 23, 6; iii. 10, 2; v. 12, 4, etc.; Gopāla: Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 11; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 5, 4. Gopā, in the sense of ‘guardian,’ occurs in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxiv. 18, in a compound. Gopītha, in the sense of ‘protection,’ occurs in Rv. v. 65, 6; x. 35, 14, etc. Goptṛ, ‘protector,’ first occurs in Av. x. 10, 5, and is thereafter common. and later, but the former is usually metaphorical in sense, applying to any protector, while the latter has the literal force of ‘cow-herd.’

gobala|गोबल
गो-बल<BR> (‘ox-strength’) Vārṣṇa (‘descendant of Vṛṣṇi’) is mentioned as a teacher in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (iii. 11, 9, 3) and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (i. 6, 1).

gomatii|गोमती
गो-मती,<BR> ‘possessing cows,’ is mentioned as a river in the Nadī-stuti, or ‘Praise of Rivers,’ in the tenth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda. 1) x. 75, 6. In that hymn a river flowing into the Indus must be meant, and its identification 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200. with the Gomal, a western tributary of the Indus, cannot be doubted. In one other passage of the Rigveda 3) viii. 24. 30. the accentuation of Gomati shows that a river is meant. It is possible that in a third passage 4) v. 61, 19. See Oldenberg, ṚgvedaNoten. 1, 355, 356. the reading should be changed to gomatír from gómatīr. Geldner 5) Vedische Studien, 3, 152, n. 2. suggests that in the two last passages the Gumti, or rather its four upper arms (hence the use of the plural) is meant: this accords well with the later use of the name and with the general probability of the river here intended being in Kurukṣetra, as the centre of Vedic civilization. 6) Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 218; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 19 et seq.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 174; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 1141. 

gomaayu|गोमायु
गो-मायु,<BR> ‘lowing like a cow,’ does not occur as the name of the ‘jackal’ till the late Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 1, 40.

gomRga|गोमृग
गो-मृग,<BR> a species of ox, now called Gayal (Bos gavaeus), is mentioned in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 11; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 1. 30. and Brāhmaṇas. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 4, 3; 5, 2, 10; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 20, 5. In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 3) ii. 1, 10, 2 it is declared to be neither a wild nor a tame animal; this presumably means that it was semidomesticated, or perhaps that it was both tamed and found wild. With the name of this animal may be compared the Mṛga Mahiṣa, which is clearly mentioned as wild in the Rigveda. 4) ix. 92, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83, 84; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 338, n. 1. See also Gayava.

goShaadii|गोषादी
गो-षादी<BR> (‘sitting on a cow’) is the name of a bird in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 24. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94.

goShuuktin|गोषूक्तिन्
गो-षूक्तिन्<BR> is mentioned in the Sarvānukramaṇī as the author of Rigveda viii. 14 and 15, and a Sāman or Chant of his seems to be referred to in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xix. 4, 9), under the title of Gauṣūkta. But see Gauṣūkti.

goShTha|गोष्ठ
गो-ष्ठ,<BR> ‘standing-place for cows,’ denotes not so much a ‘cowstall’ as the ‘grazing ground of cows,’ as Geldner 1) Vedische Studien, 3, 112, 113. shows from a passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 2) iii. 18, 14. and from a note of Mahīdhara on the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 3) iii. 21. This sense suits adequately all the passages of the Rigveda 4) i. 191, 4; vi. 28, 1; viii. 43, 17. where it occurs, and it greatly improves the interpretation of a hymn of the Atharvaveda, 5) iii. 14, 1. 5. 6, where Whitney's rendering ‘stall’ is very unsatisfactory, and Bloomfield's ‘stable’ is no better. besides being acceptable elsewhere. 6) Av. ii. 26, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 21; v. 17; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 8, 3, 2, etc.; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, vii. 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 11.

गौप-वन<BR> (‘descendant of Gopavana’) is mentioned as a pupil of Pautimāṣya in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the Kāṇva recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (ii. 6, 1; iv. 6, 1).

gaupaayana|गौपायन
गौपायन<BR> (‘descendant of Gopa’). The Gaupāyanas appear in the legend of Asamāti, Kirāta, and Ākuli, which is first met with in the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 12, 5; Jaiminīva Brāhmaṇa, iii. 167 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 41); Sāṭyāyanaka in Sāyaṇa on Rv. x. 57 (Max Müller's edition, 4^2, c et seq.); Bṛhaddevatā, vii. 83 et seq., with Macdonell's notes.

The female, Gaurī, is also often referred to. 4) Rv. i. 84, 10; iv. 12, 6; ix. 12, 3; and in the obscure verse i. 164, 11. The compound term Gaura-mṛga (‘the Gaura wild beast’) is sometimes met with. 5) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 32; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 8. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83, 224.

गौ-षूक्ति<BR> is the name of a pupil of Iṣa Śyāvāśvi according to the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 1) iv. 16, 1. in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers). It is also the name, in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 2) xix. 4, 9. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 30. of a teacher who appears to have been needlessly invented to explain the Gauṣūkta Sāman (chant), which is really the Sāman of Goṣūktin.

graha|ग्रह
ग्रह<BR> (‘seizing’) is a term applied to the sun in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) iv. 6, 5, 1. most probably not in the later sense of ‘planet,’ but to denote a power exercising magical influence. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 432, n. 2. The sense of ‘planet’ seems first to occur in the later literature, as in the Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad. 3) vi. 16. See Weber, Indian Literature, 98, n. The question whether the planets were known to the Vedic Indians is involved in obscurity. Oldenberg 4) Religion des Veda, 185 et seq.; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 50, 56 et seq. recognizes them in the Ādityas, whose number is, he believes, seven; sun, moon, and the five planets. But this view, though it cannot be said to be impossible or even unlikely, is not susceptible of proof, and has been rejected by Hillebrandt, 5) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 102 et seq. Pischel, 6) Göttingische Gelehrte Anxeigen, 1895. 447. von Schroeder, 7) Vienna Oriental Journal, 9, 109. Macdonell, 8) Vedic Mythology, p. 44. and Bloomfield, 9) Religion of the Veda, 133 et seq. among others. Hillebrandt 10) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 423. sees the planets in the five Adhvaryus mentioned in the Rigveda, 11) iii. 7, 7. but this is a mere conjecture. The five bulls (ukṣāṇaḥ) in another passage of the Rigveda 12) i. 105, 10. Cf. also i. 105, 16, with Oldenberg's note. have received a similar interpretation with equal uncertainty, 13) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 24, 36. and Durga, in his commentary on the Nirukta, 14) i. 14. even explains the term bhūmija, ‘earth-born,’ which is only mentioned by Yāska, as meaning the planet Mars. 15) See Weber, Jyotiṣa, 10, n. 2. Thibaut, 16) Astronomie, Astrologie, und Mathematik, 6. who is generally sceptical as to the mention of planets in the Veda, thinks that Bṛhaspati there refers to Jupiter; but this is extremely improbable, though in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 17) iv. 4 10, 1. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 102-104. Bṛhaspati is made the regent of Tiṣya. A reference to the planets is much more probable in the seven suns (sapta sūryāḥ) of the late Taittirīya Āraṇyaka. 18) i. 7. See on them Weber, Omina und Portenta, 339; Indische Studien, 2, 238; 9, 363; 10, 240, 271; Jyotiṣa, 10; Rāmāyaṇa, 28, n. 2. On the other hand, Ludwig's efforts to find the five planets with the sun, the moon, and the twenty-seven Nakṣatras (lunar mansions) in the Rigveda, as corresponding to the number thirty-four used in connexion with light 19) x. 55, 3. (jyotis) and the ribs of the sacrificial horse, 20) i. 162, 18. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 183 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 354 et seq.; Max Müller, Ṛgveda, iv. 2, xxx. et seq.; Whitney, Oriental and Linguistic Essays, 2, 412, n. Journal of the American Oriental Society 16, lxxxviii. is farfetched. See also Śukra, Manthin, Vena.

graabha|ग्राभ
ग्राभ<BR> (lit. ‘grasping’) designates the ‘throw’ of dice in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 81, 1; ix. 106, 3. Cf. Lüders, Das Wūrfelspiel im alten Indien, 49, 50. See also Glaha.

graama|ग्राम
ग्राम<BR> --The primitive sense of this word, which occurs frequently from the Rigveda 1) i. 44, 10; 114, 1; ii. 12, 7 (perhaps to be taken as in n. 10); x. 146, 1; 149, 4, etc.; Av. iv. 36, 7, 8; v. 17, 4; vi. 40, 2, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 45; xx. 17, etc. onwards, appears to have been ‘village.’ The Vedic Indians must have dwelt in villages which were scattered over the country, some close together, 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2, 4, 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 44. some far apart, and were connected by roads. 3) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 6, 2. The village is regularly contrasted with the forest (araṇya), and its animals and plants with those that lived or grew wild in the woods. 4) Animals: Rv. x. 90, 8; Av. ii. 34, 4; iii. 10, 6; 31, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 2, 2, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, vii. 7; xiii. 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ix. 32; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 1, 9; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8. 4, 16, etc. Plants: Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 5, 5; vii. 3, 4, 1, etc. The villages contained cattle, horses, and other domestic animals, as well as men. 5) Av. iv. 22, 2; viii. 7, 11, etc. Grain was also stored in them. 6) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 3, 13 (Kāṇva = 22, Mādhyaṃdina). In the evening the cattle regularly returned thither from the forest. 7) Rv. x. 149, 4; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 1. The villages were probably open, though perhaps a fort (Pur) might on occasion be built inside. 8) As nowadays. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 144, citing Hügel, Kashmir, 2, 45. Presumably they consisted of detached houses with enclosures, but no details are to be found in Vedic literature. Large villages (mahāgrāmāḥ) were known. 9) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 13. 4. The relation of the villagers is difficult to ascertain with precision. In several passages 10) Rv. i. 100, 10; iii. 33, 11; x. 27, 1; 127, 5; Av. iv. 7, 5; v. 20, 3 (where, however, ‘villages’ is quite probable); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 5, 2; vi. 7, 4, 9; xii. 4, 1, 3. Cf. n. 1. the word occurs with what appears to be the derivative sense of ‘body of men.’ This sense presumably started from the use of the word to denote the ‘village folk,’ as when Śaryāta Mānava is said in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11) iv. 1, 5, 2. 7. to have wandered about with his ‘village’ (grāmeṇa); but, as Zimmer 12) Altindisches Leben, 161. observes, this restricted sense nowhere appears clearly in the Rigveda, 13) See passages cited in n. 10. where indeed the ‘folk’ (jana) 14) Rv. iii. 53, 12. of the Bharatas is in one passage 15) Rv. iii. 33, 11. called the ‘horde seeking cows’ (gavyan grāmaḥ). Zimmer 16) Op. cit., 159, 160, where, however, his language is not very clear. Cf. Hopkins, Religions of India, 27, who points out that Zimmer is inaccurate in identifying the tribe with Viś. It is the clan, a division below that of the tribe (Jana). tends to regard the Grāma as a clan, and as standing midway between the family and the tribe (Viś). The Grāma may, however, perhaps be regarded more correctly 17) A village might contain a whole clan, but probably it contained at most a section of a clan. By family is meant a Hindu joint family; but the extent to which such families existed, and the number of persons included, cannot even be conjectured from the avail able evidence. Cf. Schrader, Prchistoric Antiquities, 393; Leist, Altarisches Jos Gentium, 34. as an aggregate of several families, not necessarily forming a clan, but only part of a clan (Viś), as is often the case at the present day. 18) Cf. Baden Powell, Village Communities in India, 85 et seq. Vedic literature tells us very little about the social economy of the village. There is nothing to show that the community as such held land. What little evidence there is indicates that individual tenure of land was known (see Urvarā, Kṣetra), but this, in effect though not in law, presumably meant tenure by a family rather than by an individual person. The expression ‘desirous of a village’ (grāma-kāma), which occurs frequently in the later Saṃhitās, 19) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 1, 2; 3, 2; 3, 9, 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 9; 2, 3; iv. 2, 7, etc.; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 32, thinks that grāma here means ‘herd’ (of cattle). points, however, to the practice of the king's granting to his favourites his royal prerogatives over villages so far as fiscal matters were concerned. Later 20) Cf. Baden Powell, Indian Village Community, 207 et seq. Whether or not the idea is already found in Manu, ix. 34, is disputed and uncertain. See Rājan. The germ of it lies in a different sphere--the right of the Kṣatriya, with the consent of the clan, to apportion land (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 1, 1, 8). the idea developed that the king was owner of all the land, and parallel with that idea the view that the holders of such grants were landlords. But of either idea there is no vestige in Vedic literature beyond the word grāma-kāma, which much more probably refers to the grant of regalia than to the grant of land, as Teutonic parallels show. 21) Cf. Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law, 2, 237 et seq.; Baden Powell, Village Communities in India, 83; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 48. It may be mentioned that we have no Vedic evidence as to the non-sale of land by the members of a family, except the indications mentioned under Urvarā. The later evidence is overwhelming for grāma, meaning ‘village.’ Cf. Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 2, 4; Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 14; Kauśika Sūtra, 94. Such grants probably tended to depress the position of the actual cultivators, and to turn them into tenants, but they can hardly have had this effect to any appreciable extent in early times. The village does not appear to have been a unit for legal purposes in early days, 22) Cf. Foy, Die königliche Gewalt, 20, n.; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 93; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 78, 128. and it can hardly be said to have been a political unit. The village no doubt, as later, included in its members various menials, besides the cultivating owners, and also the Brāhmaṇas and Kṣatriyas who might hold interest in it by royal grant or usage without actually cultivating land, such as chariot-makers (Ratha-kāra), carpenters (Takṣan), smiths (Karmāra), and others, but they did not presumably, in any sense, form part of the brotherhood. 23) Cf. Baden Powell, Indian Village Community, 17, 18. All alike were politically subject to the king, and bound to render him food or service or other tribute, unless he had transferred his rights to others of the royal family or household, as was no doubt often the case, either in whole or part. The king's share in a village is referred to as early as the Atharvaveda. 24) iv. 22, 2. Cf. n. 20. At the head of the village was the Grāma-ṇī, or ‘leader of the village,’ who is referred to in the Rigveda, 25) x. 62, 11; 107, 5. and often in the later Saṃhitās and in the Brāhmaṇas. 26) Av. iii. 5, 7; xix. 31, 12; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 4, 4; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 6, 5 (grāma-ṇīthya, ‘the rank of Grāmaṇī’: cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 5, 2); Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, viii. 4; x. 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xv. 15; xxx. 20; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 4, 8; 7, 3, 4; ii. 7, 18, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 1, 7; v. 4, 4, 8; viii. 6, 2, 1 (grāmaṇīthya); Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 3, 37. 38, etc. The exact meaning of the title is not certain. By Zimmer 27) Altindisches Leben, 171. the Grāmaṇī is regarded as having had military functions only, and he is certainly often connected with the Senānī, or ‘leader of an army.’ But there is no reason so to restrict the sense: presumably the Grāmaṇī was the head of the village both for civil purposes and for military operations. He is ranked in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 28) v. 4, 4, 18. as inferior to the Sūta, or ‘charioteer,’ with whom, however, he is associated 29) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 1, 5. as one of the Ratnins, the ‘jewels’ of the royal establishment. The post was especially valuable to a Vaiśya, who, if he attained it, was at the summit of prosperity (gataśrī). 30) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 4, 4; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 6, 5. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 20, n. 2. The Grāmaṇī's connexion with the royal person seems to point to his having been a nominee of the king rather than a popularly elected officer. But the post may have been sometimes hereditary, and sometimes nominated or elective: there is no decisive evidence available. The use of the singular presents difficulties: possibly the Grāmaṇī of the village or city where the royal residence was situated was specially honoured and influential. 31) Presumably, there must have been many Grāmaṇīs in a kingdom, but the texts seem to contemplate only one as in the royal entourage. Cf. also Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 60, n.; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 96; Rhys Davids, op. cit., 48, thinks that he was elected by the village council or a hereditary officer, because the appointment is only claimed for the king in late authorities like Manu, vii. 115. But there is not even so much authority for election or heredity, and we really cannot say how far the power of the early princes extended: it probably varied very much. Cf. Rājan and Citraratha.

ग्राम्य-वादिन्<BR> apparently means a ‘village judge’ in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 1, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 4; Maitrāyanī Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 1. His Sabhā, ‘court,’ is mentioned in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.

graaha|ग्राह
ग्राह,<BR> ‘the seizer,’ is the name of a disease in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) iii. 5, 3, 25; 6, 1, 25. In the Atharvaveda 2) xi. 9, 12. it perhaps means ‘paralysis’ of the thigh. 3) If the reading of the commentary ūru-grāhaiḥ be adopted; but Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 653, retaining the reading of the text urugrāhaiḥ, renders the compound as an adjective, ‘wide-gripping.’ Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 635.

graahi|ग्राहि
ग्राहि,<BR> ‘the seizer,’ appears in the Rigveda 1) x. 161, 1. and the Atharvaveda 2) ii. 9, 1; 10, 6. 8; vi. 112, 1; 113, 1; viii. 2, 12; 3, 18; xvi. 7, 1; 8, 1; xix. 45, 5. as a female demon of disease. Her son is sleep (svapna). 3) xvi. 5, 1; or perhaps ‘dream’ is meant. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 154.

griiShma|ग्रीष्म
ग्रीष्म<BR> See Ṛtu.

graivya|ग्रैव्य
ग्रैव्य,<BR> in the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 25, 2; vii. 76, 2. Cf. Bloomfield, Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, October, 1887, xix.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 472. appears to denote ‘tumours on the neck’ (grīvāḥ).

glaha|ग्लह
ग्लह<BR> denotes the ‘throw’ at dice, like Grābha, of which it is a later form, occurring in the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 28, 1 et seq. Cf. Lüders, Das Würfelspiel im alten Indien, 49.

glaavamaitreya|ग्लावमैत्रेय
ग्लाव मैत्रेय<BR> (‘descendant of Maitrī’) is mentioned in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 1) i. 12, 1. 3. Cf. Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 31. where he is said to be the same as Vaka Dālbhya. He appears as Pratistotṛ at the snake festival of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 2) xxv. 15, 3. and is referred to in the Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 3) i. 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35, 38. 

glau|ग्लौ
ग्लौ<BR> occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 83, 3. and in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 2) i. 25. as the name of some symptom of a disease, probably, as Bloomfield 3) Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, October, 1887, xv.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 17, 503; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 343. thinks, ‘boils.’ In the one passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhita, 4) xxv. 8; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 15, 7. where it is found the sense is obscure, some part of the sacrificial victim being perhaps meant. 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 500, takes glau as ‘owl.’ Cf. Galunta. GH.

gharma|घर्म
घर्म<BR> denotes in the Rigveda 1) iii. 53, 14; v. 30, 15; 43, 7; 76, 1, etc. and later 2) Av. vii. 73, 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, viii. 61; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 18. 22, etc. the pot used for heating milk, especially for the offering to the Aśvins. It hence often 3) Rv. i. 119, 2; 180, 4; vii. 70, 2; viii. 9, 4, etc.; Av. iv. 1, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxviii. 6, etc. Cf. Nirukta, vi. 32; xi. 42; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 271; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. denotes the hot milk itself, or some other hot drink.

ghaasa|घास
घास<BR> means ‘fodder’ in the Atharvaveda 1) Av. iv. 38, 7; viii. 7, 8; xi. 5, 18, etc. and later. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 75; xxi. 43; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 9, 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 10, etc. In the Rigveda 3) i. 162, 14. Ghāsi is used of the fodder of the horse victim at the Aśvamedha.

ghRNiivant|ghRNiivat|घृणीवत्|घृणीवन्त्
घृणीवन्त्<BR> is the name of some animal in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 1) xxiv. 39. In the parallel passage of the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 2) iii. 14, 20. Ghṛṇāvant is the reading. Elsewhere the word is adjectival. 3) Rv. x. 176, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99. 

ghRta|घृत
घृत,<BR> the modern Ghee or ‘clarified butter,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 134, 6; ii. 10, 4; iv. 10, 6; 58, 5. 7. 9; v. 12, 1, etc. and later 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ii. 22, etc.; Av. iii. 13, 5, etc.; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 1, 7 (with Dadhi, Mastu, Amikṣā); ix. 2, 1, 1 (Dadhi, Madhu, Ghṛta), etc. both as in ordinary use and as a customary form of sacrifice. According to a citation in Sāyaṇa's commentary on the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 3) i. 3 (p. 240, edition Aufrecht). the distinction between Ghṛta and Sarpis consisted in the latter being butter fully melted, while the former was butter melted and hardened (ghanī-bhūta), but this distinction cannot be pressed. Because the butter was thrown into the fire, Agni is styled ‘butter-faced’ (ghṛta-pratīka), 4) Rv. i. 143, 7; iii. 1, 18; v. 11, 1; x. 21, 7, etc. ‘butter-backed’ (ghṛta-pṛṣṭha), 5) Rv. i. 164, 1; v. 4, 3; 37, 1; vii. 2, 4, etc. and ‘propitiated with butter’ (ghṛta-prasatta), 6) Rv. v. 15. 1. and ‘found of butter’ (ghṛta-prī). 7) Av. xii. 1, 20; xviii. 4, 41. Water was used to purify the butter: the waters were therefore called ‘butter-cleansing’ (ghṛta-pū). 8) i. 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 227. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa^9 it is said that Ājya, Ghṛta, Āyuta, and Navanīta pertain to gods, men, Pitṛs, and embryos respectively.

ghRtakaushika|घृतकौशिक
घृत-कौशिक<BR> is mentioned in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1) ii. 5. 21; iv. 5, 27. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 384. as a pupil of Pārāśaryāyaṇa.

ghoraaangirasa|घोरआङ्गिरस
घोर आङ्गिरस<BR> is the name of a mythical teacher in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 1) xxx. 6. Cf. Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sütra, xii. 10. and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 2) iii. 17, 6. where he is teacher of the strange Kṛṣṇa Devakīputra. That the name is certainly a mere figment is shown by the fact that this ‘dread descendant of the Aṅgirases’ has a counterpart in Bhiṣaj Ātharvaṇa, 3) Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 459. ‘the healing descendant of the Atharvans,’ while in the Rigveda Sūtras 4) Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 7; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 2; Journal of the American Oriental Society. 17, 181. the Atharvāṇo vedaḥ is connected with bheṣajam and the Āṅgiraso vedaḥ with ghoram. He is accordingly a personification of the dark side of the practice of the Atharvaveda. 5) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xx, xxi, xxxviii; Atharvaveda, 8, 23; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 189, 190; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160, n. 4. He is also mentioned in the Aśvamedha section of the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 6) i. 1.

ghoSha|घोष
घोष<BR> See Ghoṣā.

ghoShavant|ghoShavat|घोषवत्|घोषवन्त्
घोषवन्त्<BR> See Svara.

ghoShaa|घोषा
घोषा<BR> is mentioned as a protégée of the Aśvins in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 117, 7; x. 40, 5. Cf. x. 39, 3. 6. probably as the recipient of a husband, who is perhaps referred to in another passage 2) i. 122, 5. See Oldenberg, ṚgvedaNoten, 1, 123. as Arjuna, though this is not likely. Sāyaṇa finds a reference there to a skin disease, which is considered in the later tradition of the Bṛhaddevatā 3) vii. 41-48, with Macdonell's notes. to have been the cause of her remaining unwed, but this view is not tenable. According to Sāyaṇa, her son, Suhastya, is alluded to in an obscure verse of the Rigveda; 4) i. 120, 5. Oldenberg, 5) Op. cit., 119. Suhastya is apparently invented from x. 41, 3, probably assisted by the fact that Vadhrimatī was given a son, Hiraṇyahasta, by the Aśvins (Rv. i. 117, 24). however, here sees a reference to Ghoṣā herself, while Pischel 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 4; 2, 92. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 143; U7ber Methode bei Interpretation des Rigveda, 43; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 247; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 52. thinks that the form (ghoṣe) is not a noun at all, but verbal. C.

chaka|चक
चक<BR> is mentioned with Piśaṅga as one of the two Unnetṛ priests at the snake festival in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35. who reads Cakka; 10, 142. n. 3, 144 

chakra|चक्र
चक्र,<BR> the ‘wheel’ of a chariot or wagon, is repeatedly mentioned from the Rigveda 1) i. 130, 9; 155, 6; 164, 2. 11. 14; 174, 5; iv. 1, 3, etc. onwards, often in a metaphorical sense. The wheel was fixed on the axle (Akṣa) when the chariot was required for use; this required considerable strength, as is shown by a reference in the Rigveda. 2) Av. xi. 7, 4; xix. 53, 1. 2, etc. The wheel consisted normally of spokes (Ara), and a nave (Nābhi), 3) Rv. viii. 41, 6. in the opening (Kha) of which the end of the axle (Āṇi) was inserted. An indication of the importance attached to the strength of the wheel is the celebration of the car of the god Pūṣan as having a wheel that suffers no damage. 4) Rv. vi. 54, 3. The usual number of wheels was two, 5) Rv. viii. 5, 29; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 16, 5; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, i. 4. but in seven passages of the Rigveda 6) i. 118, 2; 157, 3; 183, 1; viii. 58, 3; x. 41, 1; 85, 14 (all of the Aśvins' chariot); iv. 36, 1 (of a chariot made by the Ṛbhus, who are three in number). a chariot is called ‘three-wheeled,’ in a few others ‘sevenwheeled,’ 7) Rv. i. 164, 3, 12; ii. 40, 3. while in one of the Atharvaveda 8) xi. 4, 22. it is styled ‘eightwheeled.’ Zimmer 9) Altindisches Leben, viii., ix. argues that these epithets do not refer to real chariots, pointing out that in all the passages where tri-cakra, ‘three-wheeled,’ occurs there is a mythical reference. On the other hand, Weber 10) Proceedings of the Berlin Acadcmy, 1898, 564, quoting Virchow, Zeistchrift für Ethnologie, 5, 200. thinks that there might have been chariots with three wheels, one being in the centre between the two occupants. This is not very conclusive; at any rate, the seven-wheeled and the eight-wheeled chariots can hardly be regarded as indicating the existence of real vehicles with that number of wheels. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11) xi. 8, 1, 1. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 247. the potter's wheel (kaulālacakra) is referred to.

chakravaaka|चक्रवाक
चक्र-वाक<BR> is the name, apparently derived from the nature of its cry, of a species of gander (Anas casarca), the modern Chakwā, as it is called in Hindī, or Brahmany duck in English. 1) Criffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 309, n. 4. It is mentioned in the Rigveda 2) ii. 39, 3. and in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda, 3) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 3. 13; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 22. 32; xxv. 8. while in the Atharvaveda 4) xiv. 2, 64. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 89. it already appears as the type of conjugal fidelity, its characteristic in the classical literature.

chaxus|चक्षुस्
चक्षुस्,<BR> ‘eye.’ The ‘evil eye’ (ghoraṃ cakṣus) was well known in the Atharvaveda, which contains spells to counteract its influence. 1) ii. 7; xix. 45, are so employed in the ritual. As remedies against it are mentioned salve from Mount Trikakubh 2) Av. iv. 9, 6. and the Jaṅgiḍa plant. 3) Av. xix. 35, 3. In the wedding ceremony the wife is entreated not to have the evil eye (aghoracakṣus). 4) Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 4; Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 16. The structure of the eye, and its division into white (śukla), dark (kṛṣṇa), and the pupil (kanīn ikā) are repeatedly referred to in the later Brāhmaṇas. 5) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 8, 2, 26; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 254. 324; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 26, 1; 34, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 2, 2; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 1, 5, etc. So the man (puru 1) in the eye is repeatedly mentioned: Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 7, 5; iv. 15, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 3, 5; iv. 2, 2; v. 5, 2. 4, etc.; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 27, 2. The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 2, 3, adds the water (āpaḥ) in the eye, the upper and the lower lids (vartanī), and seven red lines (lohinyo rājayaḥ). Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 149. The desease Alaji appears to have been an affection of the eyes.

chaNDaala|चण्डाल
चण्डाल,<BR> 1) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 10, 7; 14, 4; Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 9; Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, ii. 12; vi. 1, etc. Cāṇḍāla, 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 21; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 17, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 1, 22. are the variant forms of the name of a despised caste, which in origin was probably a tribal body, 3) Fick, Die sociale Gliederung. 204 et seq. but which in the Brahminical theory was the offspring of Śūdra athers and Brahmin mothers. 4) Apparently accepted for the Vedic period by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 217. Cf. von Schroeder, Indiens Litcratur und Cultur, 433. The references to the caste in he Yajurveda Saṃhitās and in the Upaniṣads show clearly hat it was a degraded one, but they yield no particulars. 

chatuShpad|चतुष्पद्
चतुष्-पद्,<BR> ‘quadruped,’ is a regular name for animals from the Rigveda 1) Rv. i. 49, 3; 94, 5; 119, 1; iii. 62, 14, etc.; Av. iv. 11, 5; x. 8, 21; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, viii. 30; ix. 31; xiv. 8. 25, etc.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 2; viii. 20, etc. onwards, being frequently contrasted with Dvipad, ‘biped.’ 2) Rv. x. 117, 8; Av. vi. 107, 1, etc. Catuṣ-pāda, as an adjective applying to paśavaḥ, ‘animals,’ is also found. 3) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 18; vi. 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, 3, 2; vi. 8, 2, 17, etc.

chandra|चन्द्र
1. Candra, 1) Av. ii. 15, 2; 22, 1; iii. 31, 6, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 28; xxxix. 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 2, 2, 16, etc. Candra-mas, 2) Rv. i. 105, 1; viii. 82, 8; x. 64, 3; 85, 19; Av. xi. 6, 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 28; xxiii. 10. 59, etc. are the names of the ‘moon,’ the latter occurring from the Rigveda onwards, but the former being first used in this sense by the Atharvaveda. Very little is said about the moon in Vedic literature, except as identified with Soma, 3) See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 112, 113. The identification is clearly found in the later parts of the Rigveda. both alike being described as waxing and waning. Reference is, however, made to the regular changes of the moon, and to its alternation with the sun, 5) Rv. x. 68, 10. Cf. i. 62, 8; 72, 10. to which it, as Soma, is declared in the Rigveda to be married. 6) x. 85, 18. 19. Mention is also made of its disappearance at the time of new moon, 7) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 4, 18; iv. 6, 7, 12; xi. 1, 6, 19; xiv. 4, 2, 13; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 28, 8; perhaps Rv. x. 138, 4. and of its birth from the light of the sun. 8) Rv. ix. 71, 9; 76, 4; 86, 32; Sāmaveda, ii. 9, 2, 12, 1; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 463 et seq. Cf. Sūrya. In the Atharvaveda 9) xix. 9, 10. Av. vi. 128 is also regarded by the Kauśika Sūtra, c. 3, as referring to an eclipse of the moon. See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 533. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 349, 350, 352. reference is made to demons eclipsing the moon (grahāś cāndramāsāḥ). For the phases of the moon, and the month as a measure of time, see Māsa. For the moon and its mansions, see Nakṣatra. ^4) Rv. x. 55, 5. Cf. Av. x. 8, 32.

chandra|चन्द्र
2. Candra appears to denote ‘gold’ in a certain number of passages from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. ii. 2, 4; iii. 31, 5; Av. xii. 2, 53; Jaittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 2, 7, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, ii. 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iv. 26; xix. 93; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vi. 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 3, 4, etc. Cf. the adjective candrin in Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xx. 37; xxxi. 31. 

chapya|चप्य
चप्य<BR> is found in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 1) xix. 88; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 9; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxviii. 3. and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) xii. 7, 2, 13; 9, 1, 3. as the name of a sacrificial vessel.

chamasa|चमस
चमस<BR> denotes a ‘drinking vessel,’ usually as employed for holding Soma at the sacrifice. It is frequently mentioned from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. i. 20, 6; 110, 3; viii. 82, 7; x. 16, 8; 68, 8; 96, 9, etc.; Av. vii. 73, 3; xviii. 3, 54; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 13, etc.; Nirukta, xi. 2; xii. 38. It was made of wood (vṛkṣa), 2) Rv. x. 68, 8. and is hence called dru. 3) Rv. i. 161, 1. According to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 4) vii. 2, 11, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 280; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 167, 168. it was made of Udumbara wood.

chamuu|चमू
चमू<BR> is a term of somewhat doubtful sense occurring repeatedly in the Rigveda, and connected with the preparation of Soma. Zimmer 1) Altindisches Leben, 277, 278. considers that in the dual it denotes the two boards between which, in his opinion, the Soma was crushed (cf. Adhiṣavaṇa). Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Grassmann, Rigveda, 1, 15. however, appears to be right in taking the normal sense to designate a vessel into which the Soma was poured from the press, and Hillebrandt 3) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 164-175. shows clearly that when it occurs in the plural 4) Rv. iii. 48, 5; viii. 2, 8; 82, 7. 8; ix. 20, 6; 62, 16; 63, 2; 92, 2; 93, 3; 97, 21. 37. 46; 99, 6. 8. it always has this sense, corresponding to the Graha-pātras of the later ritual, and that sometimes it is so used in the singular 5) Rv. ix. 107, 18; x. 91, 15. or dual 6) Rv. ix. 69, 5; 71, 1; 72, 5; 86, 47; 96, 20. 21; 97 2. 48; 103, 4; 107, 10; 108. 10. also. In some cases, 7) Singular: Rv. v. 51, 4; viii. 4, 4; 76, 10; ix. 46, 3; x. 24, 1. Dual: i. 28, 9; iv. 18, 3; vi. 57, 2; ix. 36, 1. however, he recognizes its use as denoting the mortar in which the Soma was pressed: he may be right here, as this mode of preparation was probably Indo-Iranian. 8) Hillebrandt, op. cit., 1, 158-164. In a derivative sense Camū appears in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 9) xiii. 8, 2, 1; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 430, n. 1. In Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiv. 22, 19, the sense is doubtful. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 105 et seq. to denote a trough, either of solid stone or consisting of bricks, used by the Eastern people to protect the body of the dead from contact with the earth, like modern stone-lined graves or vaults.

charaka|चरक
चरक<BR> primarily denotes a ‘wandering student,’ a sense actually found in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) iii. 3, 1. More especially it denotes the members of a school of the Black Yajurveda, the practices of which are several times referred to with disapproval in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 2) iii. 8, 2, 24 (where the reference is to Taittirīya Saṃhitā vi. 3, 9, 6; 10, 2, or some parallel passage); iv. 1, 2, 19; 2, 3, 15; 4, 1, 10; vi. 2, 2, 1. 10; viii. 1, 3, 7; 7, 1, 14. 24. In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 3) xxx. 18; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 16, 1. Its occurrence in the latter text renders improbable von Schroeder's view, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 188, that Caraka included all the Black Yajurveda schools. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 287, n. 2; 3, 256, 257, 454; Indian Literature. 87; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 212. the Caraka teacher (Carakācārya) is enumerated among the sacrificial victims at the Puruṣamedha, or human sacrifice. His dedication there to ill-doing is a clear hint of a ritual feud.

charakabraahmaNa|चरकब्राह्मण
चरक-ब्राह्मण<BR> is the name of a work from which Sāyaṇa quotes in his commentary on the Rigveda. 1) viii. 66, 10; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 41.

charaachara|चराचर
चराचर<BR> (‘running about’), a term found classed with Sarīsṛpa in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 13, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 12, 10; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 29. must apparently denote some kind of animal.

charu|चरु
चरु<BR> designates a ‘kettle’ or ‘pot’ from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. i. 7, 6; vii. 104, 2; ix. 52, 3; x. 86, 18; 167, 4; Av. iv. 7, 4; ix. 5, 6; xi. 1, 16; 3, 18; xviii. 4, 16 et seq., etc. It is called pañca-bild, ‘with five openings,’ in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 1, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, v. 6; xxxii. 6; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 4, 4. 9, etc. It had a lid (apidhāna) and hooks (aṅka) by which it could be hung over a fire. 2) Rv. i. 162, 13; Av. xviii. 4, 53. It was made of iron or bronze 3) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 4, 5 Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 271. (ayasmaya). The word is also secondarily used 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 10, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 4, 7; ii. 5, 3, 4; iii. 2, 3, 1, etc. Cf.

The oxhide was turned to many uses, such as the manufacture of bowstrings, slings, and reins (see Go). It was especially often employed to place above the boards 2) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 148-150; 181-183. on which the Soma was pressed with the stones. 3) Rv. x. 94, 9; 116, 4. It was possibly also used for making skin bags. 4) Rv. x. 106, 10, is so taken by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben. 228, who compares Odyssey, x. 19. Carmaṇya denotes leather-work generally in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 5) v. 32. Cf. paricarmaṇya, Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, ii. 1. The art of tanning hides (mlā) was known as early as the Rigveda, 6) viii. 55, 3 (a late hymn). where also the word for ‘tanner’ (carmamna) occurs. 7) viii. 5, 38; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 15; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 13, 1. For the form, cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 38, n. 1; p. 249, n. 4. Details of the process are lacking, but the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 8) ii. 1, 1, 9. refers to stretching out a hide with pegs (śañkubhiḥ), and the Rigveda 9) i. 85, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 228, 253. mentions the wetting of the hide.

charShaNi|चर्षणि
चर्षणि,<BR> used in the plural, denotes in the Rigveda 1) Rv. i. 86, 5; 184, 4; iii. 43, 2; iv. 7, 4; v. 23, 1; vi. 2, 2; x. 180, 3, etc. ‘men’ in general or ‘people,’ conceived either as active beings 2) If derived from car, ‘move,’ which is probable. or as cultivators 3) If derived from kṛṣ, ‘plough or ‘till.’ in opposition to nomads. The expression ‘king of men’ (rājā carṣaṇīnām) is frequently found. 4) Rv. iii. 10, 1; v. 39, 4; vi. 30, 5; viii. 70, 1; x. 139, 1, etc. The ‘people’ are also mentioned in connexion with war. 5) Rv. i. 55, 1; 109, 6; iv. 31, 4; 37, 8; vi. 31, 1, etc. In the Atharvaveda 6) xiii. 1, 38. ‘animals’ (paśu) and ‘men’ (carṣaṇi) are spoken of together. For the five carṣaṇayaḥ, 7) Rv. v. 86, 2; vii. 15, 2; ix. 101, 9. For the derivation, see Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 185, and especially 122, 2a (from car, ‘move’); Monier Williams, Dictionary, s.v. (from kṛṣ, ‘plough’). see Pañca Janāsaḥ.

chaShaala|चषाल
चषाल,<BR> the mortar-shaped top-piece of the sacrificial post (Yūpa), is mentioned from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. i. 162, 6; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 3, 4, 2, 7; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvi. 4, etc.; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 11, 8, etc. In one passage of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) v. 2, 1, 6. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 168, n. 1; 41, 31, n. 1. it is directed to be made of wheaten dough (gaudhūma).

chaakra|चाक्र
चाक्र<BR> is the name of a man, variously styled Revottaras Sthapati Pāṭava Cākra 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. xii. 8, 1, 17. and Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra Sthapati, 2) Ibid., xii. 9, 3, 1 et seq. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 205207; 10, 85. n. 1; Indian Literature, 123; Eggeling. Sacred Books of the East, 44, 269 et seq., whose version is followed above. who is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa only. He is there said to have been expelled by the Sṛñjayas, but to have restored to them their prince Duṣṭarītu despite the opposition of the Kauravya king Balhika Prātipīya. 2) Ibid., xii. 9, 3, 1 et seq. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 205207; 10, 85, n. 1; Indian Literature, 123; Eggeling. Sacred Books of the East, 44, 269 et seq., whose version is followed above. He must have been a sage rather than a warrior, as the first passage of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. xii. 8, 1, 17. shows him in the capacity of a teacher only. Cf. Sthapati.

chaakraayaNa|चाक्रायण
चाक्रायण,<BR> ‘descendant of Cakra,’ is the patronymic of Uṣasta or Uṣasti. 1) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 5, 1; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 10, 1; 11, 1.

chaaNDaala|चाण्डाल
चाण्डाल<BR> See Caṇḍāla.

chaaxuSha|चाक्षुष
चाक्षुष,<BR> a word occurring once only in the Atharvaveda, 1) xvi. 7, 7. is, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, a patronymic (of Suyāman, a personification). Whitney 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 800. treats it as probably a simple adjective (‘of sight’). 

chaaturmaasya|चातुर्मास्य
चातुर्-मास्य,<BR> ‘four-monthly,’ denotes the festival of the Vedic ritual held at the beginning of the three seasons of four months each, into which the Vedic year was artificially divided. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 5, 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 9, 5; ii. 2, 2, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 36; ii. 5, 2, 48; 6, 4, 1; v. 2, 3, 10; xiii. 2, 5, 2; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, etc. It is clear that the sacrifices commenced with the beginning of each season, 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 36 (cf. xiv. 1, 1, 28); Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, v. 1. and it is certain that the first of them, the Vaiśvadeva, coincided with the Phālgunī full moon, 3) In the month Phālguna, or February-March. the second, the Varuṇa-praghāsas, with the Āṣāḍhī full moon, 4) In the month Āṣāḍhā, or JuneJuly. and the third, the Sāka-medha, with the Kārttikī full moon. 5) That is, in the month Kārttika, when the moon is in the asterism Kṛttikā: Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 3, 13; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, etc. There were, however, two alternative datings: the festivals could also be held in the Caitrī, the Śrāvaṇī, and Āgrahāyaṇī (Mārgaśīrṣī) full moons, 6) Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iii. 13, 1; 14, 1. 2; 15, 1. These are the fullmoon days in the months Caitra (March-April), Śrāvaṇa (July-August), and Mārgaśīṛṣa (November-December) respectively. or in the Vaiśākhī, Bhādrapadī, and Pauṣī full moons. 7) Deva's Paddhati on Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, pp. 430, 450, 497. These are the full-moon days in the months Vaiśākha (April-May), Bhādrapada (August-September), and Pauṣa (December-January) respectively. Neither of the later datings is found in a Brāhmaṇa text, but each may well have been known early, since the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 8) vii. 4, 8, 1. 2. and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 9) v. 9, 8. 11. both recognize the full moon in the month Caitra as an alternative to the full moon in the month Phālguna, for the beginning of the year. Jacobi considers that the commencement of the year with the full moon in the asterism Phalgunī, which is supported by other evidence, 10) Indian Antiquary, 23, 156 et seq.; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 49, 223 et seq.; 50, 72-81. indicates that the year at one time began with the winter solstice with the moon in Phalgunī, corresponding to the summer solstice when the sun was in Phalgunī. These astronomical conditions, he believes, existed in the time of the Rigveda, 11) vii. 103, 9; x. 85, 13. Cf. Festgruss an Rudolf von Roth, 68 et seq. and prevailed in the fourth millennium B.C. The alternative dates would then indicate periods when the winter solstice coincided with the Caitrī or the Vaiśākhī full moon. But Oldenberg 12) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 630 et seq.; 49, 475, 476; 50, 453-457. and Thibaut 13) Indian Antiquary, 24, 86 et seq. seem clearly right in holding that the coincidence of Phālgunī with the beginning of spring, 14) See Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 6, 8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 1, 2-4. So the Phālgunī full moon is called ‘the mouth of the seasons (ṛtūnāṃ mukham)--e.g., Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxi. 15, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, viii. 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 6, 9; and the first season is always spring: Śatapaṭha Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 3, 8-14; ii. 1, 3, 1; vii. 2, 4, 26; xi. 2, 7, 32; xii. 8, 2, 34; xiii. 5, 4, 28; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 2, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiii. 1. 7, etc. See Weber, Naxatra, 2, 352. which is certain, is fatal to this view, and that there is no difficulty in regarding this date as consistent with the date of the winter solstice in the new moon of Māgha, which is given by the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, 15) xix. 3. and which forms the basis of the calculations of the Jyotiṣa. 16) Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologie, und Mathematik, 17, 18. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 329 et seq.; Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, lxxxvi., lxxxvii.; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1101-1104. The full moon in Phālguna would be placed about one month and a half after the winter solstice, or, say, in the first week of February, which date, according to Thibaut, may reasonably be deemed to mark the beginning of a new season in India about 800 B.C. At the same time it must be remembered that the date was necessarily artificial, inasmuch as the year was divided into three seasons, each of four months, and the Indian year does not in fact consist of three equal seasons. The variations of the other datings would then not be unnatural if any school wished to defer its spring festival, the Vaiśvadeva, to the time when spring had really manifested itself. See also Saṃvatsara.

chaandhanaayana|चान्धनायन
चान्धनायन<BR> is the patronymic of Ānandaja in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372, 383.

chaayamaana|चायमान
चायमान<BR> is the patronymic in the Rigveda (vi. 27, 5. 8) of Abhyāvartin. 

chaaSha|चाष
चाष,<BR> the ‘blue woodpecker’ (Coracias indica), is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) x. 97, 13. as well as in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 4; 15, 9; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 23; xxv. 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 92.

chichchika|चिच्चिक
चिच्चिक<BR> is a bird mentioned with the equally unknown Vṛṣārava in one hymn of the Rigveda. 1) x. 146, 2. It may perhaps be compared with the Ciṭaka mentioned by Dārila in his commentary on the Kauśika Sūtra. 2) xxvi. 20; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 266. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 90; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 589.

chitra|चित्र
चित्र<BR> is the name of several persons. (a) The Rigveda 1) viii. 21, 18. contains a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) of a prince Citra. The later legend 2) Bṛhaddevatā, vii. 58 et. seq., with Macdonell's notes. attributes this panegyric to Sobhari, and describes Citra as king of the rats. (b) Citra Gāṅgyāyani or Gārgyāyaṃ is mentioned in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 1) i. 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 395; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 16, n. 1. as a contemporary of Āruṇi and Śvetaketu. (c) Citra Gauśrāyaṇi is mentioned as a teacher in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxiii. 5. Cf. Weber, loc. cit.

chitraratha|चित्ररथ
चित्र-रथ<BR> (‘having a brilliant car’) is the name of two persons. (a) It designates an Āryan prince, who, with Arṇa, was defeated by Indra for the Turvaśa-Yadus on the Sarayu (perhaps the modern Sarju in Oudh), according to the Rigveda (iv. 30, 18). The locality would accord with the close connexion of Turvaśa and Krivi or Pañcāla. (b) Citraratha is also the name of a king for whom the Kāpeyas performed a special kind of sacrifice (dvirātra), with the result, according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 1) xx. 12, 5. Cf. Hopkins. Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 52, 53; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 32; Indian Literature, 68, n. that in the Caitrarathi family only one member was a Kṣatra-pati, the rest dependents. Apparently this must mean that the Caitrarathis were distinguished from other families of princes by the fact that the chief of the clan received a markedly higher position than in most cases, in which probably the heads of the family were rather an oligarchy than a monarch and his dependents. See Rājan.

chitraa|चित्रा
चित्रा<BR> See Nakṣatra.

chilvaTi|चिल्वटि
चिल्वटि<BR> is the name of an unknown animal in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa (i. 2, 7).

chiipudru|चीपुद्रु
चीपुद्रु<BR> designates some substance mentioned in a hymn of the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 127, 2. as of use in healing. The commentator Sāyaṇa reads Cīpadru, and explains the word as a kind of tree. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the Kauśika Sūtra 2) xxvi. 34. refers to the employment of splinters of Palāśa wood in the ritual application of this hymn. 3) Av. vi. 127. Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 376. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 350-352; Atharvaveda, 62; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 386. The text of Roth and Whitney reads by error Śīpudru. suggests that the form of the word should be Cīpuḍu.

chumuri|चुमुरि
चुमुरि<BR> is the name of an enemy of Dabhīti, for whom he, along with his friend Dhuni, is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) vi. 20, 13; x. 113, 9. In vi. 26, 6, Cumuri alone is mentioned, and Dāsas or Dasyus generally are stated to have been subdued for Dabhīti in iv. 30, 21; ii. 13, 9. See also ii. 15, 9; vii. 19, 4. as having been defeated by Indra. Elsewhere 2) Rv. vi. 18, 8. the two are spoken of, along with Śambara, Pipru, and Śuṣṇa, as having been crushed by Indra, who destroyed their castles. It is impossible to say whether real men or demons are meant, but in favour of a man being denoted by Cumuri is the form of the name, which seems not to be Āryan. 3) Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 1, xxii. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 275; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology p. 162.

chuuDabhaagavitti|चूडभागवित्ति
चूड भागवित्ति<BR> (‘descendant of Bhagavitta’) is mentioned in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaṇiṣad 1) vi. 3, 9 (Kāṇva=vi. 3, 17. 18 Mādhyaṃdina). The text of the Kāṇva has, as usual, Cūla. as a pupil of Madhuka Paiṅgya.

chuurNa|चूर्ण
चूर्ण<BR> appears to denote an aromatic powder in the phrase cūrṇa-hasta, used of the Apsarases in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad (i. 4).

chedi|चेदि
चेदि<BR> is the name of a people who, with their king Kaśu, the Caidya, are mentioned only in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’), occurring at the end of one hymn of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 5, 37-39. where their generosity is celebrated as unsurpassed. They occur later in the Epic with the Matsyas, and lived in Bandela Khaṇḍa (Bundelkhand). 2) Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 12, 688, n. 3; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 129; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 332; Oldenberg, Buddha, 402. In Vedic times they were probably situated in much the same locality.

chelakashaaNDilyaayana|चेलकशाण्डिल्यायन
चेलक शाण्डिल्यायन<BR> (‘descendant of Śāṇḍilya’) is mentioned as a teacher in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (x. 4, 5, 3).

chaikitaaneya|चैकितानेय
चैकितानेय<BR> (‘descendant of Cekitāna’) is mentioned as a teacher in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 1) i. 37, 7; ii. 5, 2. The Caikitāneyas are also referred to there 2) i. 42, 1. in connexion with the Sāman which they worshipped. Brahmadatta Caikitāneya is brought into connexion with the Sāman in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 3) i. 3, 24. and Vāsiṣṭha Caikitāneya is known to the Ṣaḍviṃśa 4) iv. 1. and Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇas. 5) Indische Studien, 4, 373, 384. The word is a patronymic, formed from Caikitāna, according to Śaṅkara, 6) On {|Bṛhadāraṇyaka|} Upaniṣad, loc. cit. but more probably from Cekitāna, 7) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. a name found in the Epic.

chaikitaayana|चैकितायन
चैकितायन,<BR> ‘descendant of Cikitāyana 1) Śaṅkara on Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 8, 1. or Cekita,’ 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. is the patronymic of Dālbhya in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 3) i. 8, 1.

chaidya|चैद्य
चैद्य<BR> See Cedi.

chailaki|चैलकि
चैलकि,<BR> ‘descendant of Celaka,’ is the patronymic of Jīvala in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ii. 3, 1, 34).

chora|चोर
चोर,<BR> ‘thief,’ is only found in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, a late work, in its last book (x. 65). The Vedic terms are Taskara Tāyu, Stena, and Paripanthin.

chyavataanamaarutaashva|च्यवतानमारुताश्व
च्यवतान मारुताश्व<BR> (‘descendant of Marutāśva’) is apparently the name of a prince in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’), in the Rigveda. 1) v. 33, 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3. 155. Two distinct persons may, however, be meant.

chyavana|च्यवन
च्यवन,<BR> 1) This form is found even in the Nirukta (iv. 19), regularly in all the Vedic texts other than the Rigveda, and in the Epic. Cyavāna, 2) The Rv. has this form throughout. are variant forms of the name of an ancient Ṛṣi, or seer. The Rigveda 3) i. 116, 10; 117, 13; 118, 6; v. 74, 5; vii. 68, 6; 71, 5; x. 39, 4. represents him as an old decrepit man, to whom the Aśvins restored youth and strength, making him acceptable to his wife, and a husband of maidens. The legend is given in another form in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 4) iv. 1, 5, 1 et seq. where Cyavana is described as wedding Sukanyā, the daughter of Śaryāta. He is there called a Bhṛgu or Āṅgirasa, and is represented as having been rejuvenated by immersion in a pond--the first occurrence of a motive, later very common in Oriental literature. Another legend about Cyavāna is apparently alluded to in an obscure hymn of the Rigveda, 5) x. 61, 1-3. where he seems to be opposed to the Paktha prince Tūrvayāṇa, an Indra worshipper, while Cyavāna seems to have been specially connected with the Aśvins. This explanation of the hymn, suggested by Pischel, 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 71-77; accepted by Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 465. is corroborated by the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, 7) iii. 121-128; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, cxlvi; 26, 43 et seq. which relates that Vidanvant, another son of Bhṛgu, supported Cyavana against Indra, who was angry with him for sacrificing to the Aśvins; it is also noteworthy that the Aśvins appear in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 8) iv. 1, 5, 13 et seq. as obtaining a share in the sacrifice on the suggestion of Sukanyā. But a reconciliation of Indra and Cyavana must have taken place, because the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 9) viii. 21, 4; Pischel, op. cit., 1, 75. relates the inauguration of Śāryāta by Cyavana with the great Indra consecration (aindreṇa mahābhiṣekeṇa). In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇā 10) xiii. 5, 12; xix. 3, 6; xiv. 6, 10; xi. 8, 11. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 243, 250-254; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 156; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 51, 52; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 43 et seq.; Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 56, 57. Cyavana is mentioned as a seer of Sāmans or Chants. CH.

Chaga|छग
छग<BR> is the name of the ‘goat’ in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (v. 6, 22, 1). Cf. Aja and Chāga.

Chadis|छदिस्
छदिस्<BR> is used once in the Rigveda, 1) x. 85, 10 (of Sūryā's bridal car). and not rarely later, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 9, 4; 10, 5. 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, v. 28; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 29; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 3, 9, etc. to denote the covering of a wagon or the thatch of a house, or something analogous to these. Weber 3) Indische Studien, 17, 208. thinks that in one passage of the Atharvaveda 4) iii. 7, 3. the word designates a constellation, and Whitney, 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 95. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 336. who does not decide whether that interpretation is necessary, suggests that the constellation  Aquarii may be meant, sicne the next verse mentions Vicṛtau, which is the constellation  and  Scorpionis, and is not far from Aquarius. See also Chardis.

Chandas|छन्दस्
1. Chandas in the Rigveda usually denotes a ‘song of praise’ or ‘hymn.’ 1) Rv. x. 85, 8 (an obscure verse); 114, 5; Av. iv. 34, 1; v. 26, 5; vi. 124, 1; xi. 7, 8, etc. The original sense of the word, as derived from the verb chand, ‘to please,’ was probably ‘attractive spell,’ ‘magic hymn,’ 2) Cf. Roth in St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. which prevailed on the gods. In a very late hymn of the Rigveda, 3) Rv. x. 90, 9. as well as in one of the Atharvaveda, 4) Av. xi. 7, 24. the word is mentioned in the plural (chandāṃsi), beside Ṛc (ṛcaḥ), Sāman (sāmāni), and Yajus, and seems to retain its original meaning, not improbably with reference to the magical subject-matter of the Atharvaveda. From denoting a (metrical) hymn it comes to mean ‘metre’ in a very late verse of the Rigveda, 5) x. 14, 16. in which the ‘Gāyatrī, the Triṣṭubh, and all (sarvā) the metres (chandāṃsi) are mentioned. In the later Saṃhitās three 6) Av. xviii. 1, 17; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 27, etc. or seven 7) Av. viii. 9, 17. 19, etc. metres are enumerated, and in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 8) viii. 3, 3, 6, etc. eight. By the time of the Rigveda Prātiśākhya 9) xvi. 1 et seq. Cf. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, xcv. et seq. the metres were subjected to a detailed examination, though much earlier references are found to the number of syllables in the several metres. 10) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiv. 4; Jaittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 2, 7. Later the word definitely denotes a Vedic text generally, as in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 11) xi. 5, 7, 3. So Gobhila Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 3, 4. 15, etc. 

Chandas|छन्दस्
2. Chandas occurs in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 12, 3. in the adjectival compound bṛhac-chandas, which is used of a house, and must mean ‘having a large roof.’ Bloomfield 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 345; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 150. accepts the reading as correct, but Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 105. considers emendation to Chadis necessary.

Chandoga|छन्दोग
छन्दो-ग,<BR> ‘metre-singing,’ is the term applied to reciters of the Sāmans, no doubt because these chants were sung according to their order in the Chandaārcika of the Sāmaveda. It is only found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) x. 5, 2, 10. and often in the Sūtras. 2) Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ii. 2; xxii. 4; Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, x. 8, 33; xiii. 1, etc. Cf. Oldenberg, Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1908, 720.

Chardis|छर्दिस्
छर्दिस्<BR> occurs often in the Rigveda, 1) i. 48, 15; 114, 5; vi. 15, 3; 46, 9. 12, etc. and occasionally later, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 9, 2; 3, 6, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 19; xiv. 12. denoting a secure dwelling-place. The word appears to be incorrectly written, because the metre shows that the first syllable is always short. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Oldenberg, Prolegomena, 477. accordingly suggested that Chadis should be read instead. But Chadis means ‘roof,’ while Chardis never has that sense. Bartholomae 4) Studien, 1, 47; 2, 58. Cf. Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 1, xii., n. 2; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 55, 312. is therefore probably right in suggesting some other form, such as Chaḍis.

Chaaga|छाग
छाग,<BR> ‘goat,’ is found in the Rigveda, 1) i. 162, 3. and not rarely later. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 89; xxi. 40. 41; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 3, 4; v. 1, 3, 14; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 2. See Aja and Chaga. J.

jagat|जगत्
जगत्,<BR> ‘moving,’ is applied sometimes in the Atharvaveda, and later to the domestic animals in particular, as opposed to wild animals (śvapad). 1) Av. viii. 5, 11, etc. Occasionally the cow is mentioned separately, when the word jagat covers the rest of the domesticated animals. 2) Av. i. 31, 4; x. 1, 29; xix. 47, 10; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 59. In the Rv. the sense of animal in general is usually sufficient; but cf. jagatī in i. 157, 5; vi. 72, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 150, n.

jangiDa|जङ्गिड
जङ्गिड<BR> is the name of a healing plant mentioned in the hymns of the Atharvaveda. 1) ii. 4; xix. 34. 35. It was used as an amulet against the diseases, or symptoms of disease, Takman, Balāsa, Āśarīka, Viśarīka, Pṛṣṭyāmaya, 2) Av. xix. 34, 10. fevers and rheumatic pains, Viṣkandha and Saṃskandha, 3) Av. ii. 4, 1; xix. 34, 1. 5. Jambha, and so on. But it is also regarded as a specific against all diseases, and as the best of healing powers. 4) Av. xix. 34, 9. 7. It is said to be produced from the juices (rasa) of ploughing (kṛṣi), 5) Av. ii. 4, 5. but this need only mean that it grew in cultivated land, not that it was itself cultivated. What plant the name designates is quite uncertain, for it disappears in the later literature. Caland 6) Altindisches Zauberritual, 15, rendering Kauśika Sūtra, viii. 15. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 433; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 42; Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 141; Grohmann, ibid., 9, 417; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 65, 66, 390. takes it in the Kauśika Sūtra to be the Terminalia arjuneya.

jatuu|जतू
जतू,<BR> the ‘bat,’ occurs in the Atharvaveda, 1) ix. 2, 22. and is mentioned as one of the victims at the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 25. 26. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 86. 

jana|जन
जन,<BR> besides meaning ‘man’ as an individual, with a tendency to the collective sense, commonly denotes a ‘people’ or ‘tribe’ in the Rigveda and later. Thus, the ‘five tribes’ (Panca Janāḥ or Janāsaḥ) are frequently referred to, and in one hymn of the Rigveda 1) viii. 6, 46. 48. the ‘people of Yadu’ (yādva jana) and the Yadus (yādvāḥ) are synonymous. Again, the king (rājan) is described as ‘protector (gopā) of the people (janasya),’ 2) Rv. iii. 43, 5. So Soma is called gopati janasya, ‘protector of the people,’ Rv. ix. 35, 5. and there are other references to king and Jana. 3) Rv. v. 58, 4. The people of the Bharatas (bhārata jana) is also mentioned; 4) Rv. iii. 53, 12. See also Bharata. Cf. also x. 174, 5 = Av. i. 29, 6. there is no ground to assume with Hopkins 5) Religions of India, 26, 27. It is true that the Bharatas are called a gavyan grāmaḥ, ‘a horde eager for booty,’ in Rv. iii. 33, 11; but Grāma has there merely a general application. Seen. 10. that Jana in this case means a clan or horde (Grāma), as distinguished from a people. It is difficult to say exactly how a people was divided. Zimmer 6) Altindisches Leben, 159, 160. argues from a passage in the Rigveda 7) ii. 26, 3. that a people was divided into cantons (Viś), cantons into joint families or clans, or village communities (Grāma, Vṛjana), and these again into single families. He thinks that the four divisions are reflected in the passage in question. by Jana, Viś, Janman, and Putrāḥ, or sons, and argues that each village community was originally founded on relationship. But it is very doubtful whether this precise division of the people can be pressed. The division of the Jana into several Viś may be regarded as probable, for it is supported by the evidence of another passage of the Rigveda, 8) x. 84, 4. Viśaḥ may have the same sense in several other passages--iv. 24, 4; v. 61, 1; vi. 26, 1; vii. 79, 2; viii. 12, 29--but it need not necessarily bear this sense. But in x. 91, 2, there is a clear contrast between Viś and Jana. which mentions the Viś as a unit of the fighting men, and thus shows that, as in Homeric times and in ancient Germany, relationship was deemed a good principle of military arrangement. But the subdivision of the Viś into several Grāmas is very doubtful. Zimmer 9) Op. cit., 161. He also relies on Rv. v. 53, 11, where the Maruts are divided into śardha, vrāta, and gaṇa; but these words are vague. admits that neither Grāma 10) Rv. iii. 33. 11. See n. 5. nor Vṛjana 11) Rv. vii. 32, 27; x. 42, 10. has the special sense of a subdivision of the Viś when used for war, for both words only denote generally an armed host. He finds other designations of the village host in Vrā 12) Rv. i. 126, 5 (viśyā iva vrāḥ). and in Vrāja, 13) Rv. x. 179, 2=Av. vii. 72, 2. but it is sufficient to say that the former passage is of extremely doubtful import, 14) Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 121, 319. and that the latter has no reference to war at all. It is therefore impossible to state in what exact relation the Grāma in Vedic times stood to the Viś or to the family (Kula or Gotra). The confusion is increased by the vagueness of the sense of both Grāma and Viś. If the latter be regarded as a local division, then no doubt the Grāma must have been a part of a district; but if a Viś was a unit of relationship, then a Grāma may have contained families of different Viśes, or may have sometimes coincided with a Viś, or have contained only a part of a Viś. But in any case the original state of affairs must have been greatly modified by the rise of the system of caste, and the substitution of a hierarchical for a political point of view. The elements of the people were represented by the family--either as an individual family inhabiting one home (Kula), and consisting often, no doubt, of a joint family of brothers, or as a patriarchal family of sons who still lived with their father--and by the clan, the later Gotra, which included all those who claimed a common ancestor. The Gotra may be regarded as roughly corresponding to the Latin gens and the Greek , and possibly the Viś may be the equivalent of the curia and , and the Jana of the tribus and  or . 15) Cf. Iliad, 2, 362. These three divisions may also be seen in the Viś, Zantu, and Daqyu of the Iranian world, where the use of Viś suggests that in the Indian Viś a relationship based on blood rather than locality is meant--and perhaps even in the vicus, pagus, and civitas of the old German polity described in the Germania 16) Chap. vii. Zimmer gives other equations, for which cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 393 et seq. The exact parallelism cannot in any case be pressed. of Tacitus. The family in some form appears as the third element of the Jana in a passage of the Rigveda, 17) x. 91, 2, where janaṃ janam and viśaṃ viśam occur, and where a contrast must be meant. where the house (gṛha) is contrasted with the Jana and the Viś. Possibly, too, another passage 18) Rv. vii. 82, 1. contrasts the adhvara, or family sacrifice, with that of the Jana or Viś, rather than, as Zimmer 19) Altindisches Leben, 435. thinks, the village with the two larger units. But it is significant of the particularism of the Vedic Indians that while the king maintained a fire which might be regarded as the sacred fire of the tribe, there is no sure trace 20) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 126. Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 158; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 32, 33; Jolly, Zeitschrift der Dcutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 50, 512 et seq. of any intermediate cult between that of the king and that of the individual householder. The real elements in the state are the Gotra and the Jana, just as ultimately the gens and tribus, the  and  are alone important. It may be that Viś sometimes represents in the older texts what later was known as the Gotra. See Viś. This appears clearly when the constitution of society in the Brāhmaṇa period is considered. The tribe or people still exists, and is presupposed, but the division into Viś disappears. The real division is now the separate castes (Varṇa), but the numerous sections into which each of them is divided appear to be based in part on the ancient Gotra.

janashaarkaraxya|जनशार्करक्ष्य
2. Jana Śārkarakṣya (‘descendant of Śarkarakṣa’) is mentioned as a teacher in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (x. 6, 1, 1 et seq.) and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (v. 11, 1; 15, 1). He was a contemporary of Aśvapati Kaikeya, and of Aruṇa Aupaveśi and his son Uddālaka Āruṇi.

janaka|जनक
जनक,<BR> king of Videha, plays a considerable part in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xi. 3, 1, 2; 4, 3, 20; 6, 2, 1 et seq. and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 2) iii. 1, 1; iv. 1, 1; 2, 1; 4, 7; v. 14, 8. as well as in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa 3) i. 19, 2 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 23, 329); ii. 76 (ibid., 15, 238). and the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad. 4) iv. 1. He was a contemporary of Yājñavalkya Vāja saneya, 5) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 3, 1, 2; 4, 3, 20; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, loc. cit.; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. of Śvetaketu Āruṇeya, and of other sages. 6) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 6, 2, 1 et seq. He had become famous for his generosity and his interest in the discussion of the nature of Brahman, as ultimate basis of reality, in the life-time of Ajātaśatru of Kāśi. 7) Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, loc. cit.; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 1, 1. It is significant that he maintained a close intercourse with the Brahmins of the Kuru-Pañcālas, such as Yājñavalkya and Śvetaketu; for this indicates that the home of the philosophy of the Upaniṣads was in the Kuru-Pañcāla country rather than in the east. There is a statement in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 8) xi. 6, 2, 10. that he became a Brahmin (brahmā). This does not, however, signify a change of caste, but merely that in knowledge he became a Brahmin (see Kṣatriya). Janaka is occasionally mentioned in later texts: in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 9) iii. 10, 9, 9. he has already become quite mythical; in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 10) xvi. 26, 7. a sapta-rātra or seven nights' rite is ascribed to him. It is natural to attempt to date Janaka by his being a contemporary of Ajātaśatru, and by identifying the latter with the Ajātasattu of the Pāli texts: 11) Vincent Smith, Early History of India, 26 et seq. this would make the end of the sixth century B.C. the approximate date of Janaka. 12) Hoernle, Osteology, 106. But it is very doubtful whether this identification can be supported: Ajātaśatru was king of Kāśi, whereas Ajātasattu was king of Magadha, and his only connexion with Kāśi was through his marriage with the daughter of Pasenadi of Kosala. 13) Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 3 et seq. Moreover, the acceptance of this chronology would be difficult to reconcile with the history of the development of thought; for it would make the rise of Buddhism contemporaneous with the Upaniṣads, whereas it is reasonably certain that the older Upaniṣads preceded Buddhism. 14) See e.g., von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur and Cultur, 243; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 224; Deussen, Philosophy of the Upaniṣads, 23 et seq.; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 25, 29. Nor do the Vedic texts know anything of Bimbisāra or Pasenadi, or any of the other princes famed in Buddhist records. The identification 15) Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 135; Von Schroeder, op. cit., 189; Macdonell, op. cit., 214. of Janaka of Videha and the father of Sītā is less open to objection, but it cannot be proved, and is somewhat doubtful. In the Sūtras Janaka appears as an ancient king who knew of a time when wifely honour was less respected than later. 16) Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 48. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 426 et seq.; Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 421 et seq.; Von Schroeder, op. cit., 187-189; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 175, 231; Oldenberg, Buddha, 31, n., who properly emphasizes the difficulty of attaching much importance to the names of the leaders of the thought of the Upaniṣads.

janataa|जनता
जनता,<BR> a word frequently found in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 1, 4; 6, 4; 3, 4, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, ix. 17; Av. v. 18, 12, etc. and the Brāhmaṇas, 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 6, 1; ii. 3, 1, 3; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7. 9; iii. 31; v. 9, etc. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 153, n. denotes the people as a community (cf. Sabhā) or as a religious unit.

janapada|जनपद
जन-पद<BR> in the Brāhmaṇas denotes both the ‘people,’ as opposed to the king, 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 14 (plural); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 2, 17. and the ‘land’ or ‘relam.’ 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 9, 9; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 1, 20; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 11, 5; viii. 1, 5. The ‘subjects’ are also denoted by the adjectival jānapada. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 5, 1, 20.

janamejaya|जनमेजय
1. Janam-ejaya (‘man-impelling’) is the name of a king, a Pārikṣita, 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 1 et seq.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 34; viii. 11. 21; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 8, 27, etc. famous towards the end of the Brāhmaṇa period. He is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) xi. 5, 5, 13. as owning horses which when wearied were refreshed with sweet drinks, and as a performer of the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice. 3) xiii. 5, 4, 1-3. His capital, according to a Gāthā quoted in the Śatapatha 4) xiii. 5, 4, 2. and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇas, 5) viii. 21. was Āsandīvant. His brothers Ugrasena, Bhīmasena, and Śrutasena are mentioned as having by the horse sacrifice purified themselves from sin. The priest who performed the sacrifice for him was Indrota Daivāpi Śaunaka. 6) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 1; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, loe. cit. On the other hand the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 7) viii. 21. Cf. iv. 27; vii. 34. which also mentions his Aśvamedha, names Tura Kāvaṣeya as his priest. It also contains an obscure tale stating that at one sacrifice of his he did not employ the Kaśyapas, but the Bhūtavīras, being, however, induced by the Asitamṛgas to have recourse to the Kaśyapas again. 8) vii. 27. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 204; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 438, n. 229; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 345, n. He was a Kuru prince; see Parikṣit. The Gopatha Brāhmaṇa 9)i. 2, 5. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 123125; 134-136; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 37, 65 et seq.; 42, 239; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 28 et seq. tells an absurd tale about him, evidently as of an ancient hero.

janamejaya|जनमेजय
2. Janam-ejaya is in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35. the name of a priest who officiated at the snake sacrifice.

janashruta|जनश्रुत
जन-श्रुत<BR> (‘famed among men’) Kāṇḍviya is the name of a pupil of Hṛtsvāśaya, mentioned in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 40, 2), and of Vārakya, a pupil of Jayanta, referred to in the same Brāhmaṇa (iii. 41, 1; iv. 17, 1). Cf. Jānaśruti.

jani|जनि
जनि, जनी<BR> --These words appear to denote ‘wife,’ usually applying to her in relation to her husband (Pati). The more general sense of ‘woman’ is doubtful; for when Uṣas is called a fair Janī, 1) Rv. iv. 52, 1. ‘wife’ may be meant, and the other passage 2) v. 61, 3. cited for this sense by Delbrück, 3) Die indogermanischen Verwandschaftsnamen, 413. which refers to the begetting of childern, seems to demand the sense of ‘wives.’ Since the words usually appear in the plural, 4) i. 85, 1; iv. 5, 5; 19, 5; vii. 18, 2; 26, 3; ix. 86, 32; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xii. 35; xx. 40. 43, etc. Cf. Rv. x. 43, 1. In x. 110, 5, the phrase is patibhyo na janayaḥ, where both plurals may be generic it is possible they may refer not to ‘wives’ proper, but to Hetairai. This is, however, rendered unlikely because the Rigveda 5) x. 18, 8. Cf. janitvana in viii. 2, 42. uses the phrase patyur janitvam, denoting ‘wifehood to a husband,’ as well as the expression janayo na patnīḥ, 6) i. 62, 10; 186, 7. ‘like wives (who are) mistresses,’ 7) The distinction of sense was probably this: jani meant ‘wife,’ as bearing children (from jan, ‘beget’), while patnī was ‘wife,’ as being mistress of the house (feminine of pati, ‘lord,’ ‘husband’). besides containing passages in which the word has reference to marriage. 8) v. 61, 3. So in x. 40, 10, the word seems certainly to refer to marriage. The singular occurs in the dialogue of Yama and Yamī. 9) x. 10, 3.

janitR|जनितृ
जनितृ<BR> 1) Rv. i. 129, 11; 164, 33; iii. 1, 10; 54, 9, etc.; Av. iv. 1, 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 87, etc. and Janitrī 2) Rv. iii. 48, 2; 54, 14; Av. vi. 110, 13; ix. 5, 30, etc. are frequent words, in the Rigveda and later, for ‘father’ and ‘mother’ regarded as the ‘begetter’ and the ‘bearer’ respectively of the child. See Pitṛ, Mātṛ.

jantu|जन्तु
जन्तु,<BR> besides the general sense of ‘man,’ has also in a few passages 1) Rv. 1. 94, 5; x. 140, 4. the more restricted sense of ‘follower’ or ‘subject.’ The ‘followers of Śvaitreya’ 2) Rv. v. 19, 3. may be compared with the ‘subjects (viśaḥ) of Tṛṇaskanda.’ 3) Rv. i. 172, 3.

janman|जन्मन्
जन्मन्<BR> appears to have the sense of ‘relations’ in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) iii. 15, 2; ii. 26, 3 (where janena, viśā, janmanā, putraiḥ, is the series). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 160, and see Jana and Viś. being used collectively in the second of them.

janya|जन्य
जन्य<BR> has in the Rigveda (iv. 38, 6) and the Atharvaveda (xi. 8, 1) the special sense of bridesman.’

jabaalaa|जबाला
जबाला<BR> is the name of the mother of an illegitimate son, Satyakāma, in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (iv. 4, 1. 2. 4). 

jabhya|जभ्य
जभ्य,<BR> ‘snapper,’ denotes in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 50, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 237. an insect destructive to grain.

jamadagni|जमदग्नि
जमद्-अग्नि<BR> is one of the somewhat mythical sages of the Rigveda, where he is frequently mentioned. In some passages 1) Rv. iii. 62, 18; viii. 101, 8; ix. 62, 24; 65, 25. his name occurs in such a way as to indicate that he is the author of the hymn; once 2) Rv. x. 167, 4. he is thus associated with Viśvāmitra. In other passages 3) Rv. vii. 96, 3; ix. 97, 51. he is merely referred to, and the Jamadagnis are mentioned once. 4) Rv. iii. 53, 15. 16. In the Atharvaveda, 5) ii. 32, 3 (cf. Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iv. 36; Mantra Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 1); iv. 29, 3; v. 28, 7; vi. 137, 1; xviii. 3, 15. 16. as well as the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 6) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 12, 4; iii. 1, 7, 3; 3, 5, 2; v. 2, 10, 5; 4, 11, 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 7, 19; iv. 2, 9; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvi. 19; xx. 9; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 62; xiii. 56. and the Brāhmaṇas, 7) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ix. 4, 14; xiii. 5, 15; xxi. 10, 5-7; xxii. 7, 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 16; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2, 2, 14; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, i. 9, 7; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 2, 4; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 11; iv. 3, 1, etc. he is quite a frequent figure. Here he appears as a friend of Viśvāmitra 8) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 7, 3; v. 4, 11, 3; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 15. and a rival of Vasiṣṭha. 9) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, loc. cit. He owed his prosperity to his catūrātra, or ‘four-night’ ritual, with which his family were also very successful. 10) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxi. 10, 5-7. In the Atharvaveda 11) ii. 32, 3; vi. 137, 1. Jamadagni is connected with Atri and Kaṇva, as well as Asita and Vitahavya. He was Adhvaryu priest at the proposed sacrifice of Śunaḥśepa. 12) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 16. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connscticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 53, 54; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 319; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 95.

jambha|जम्भ
जम्भ<BR> occurs twice in the Atharvaveda as the name of a disease or a demon of disease. In one passage 1) ii. 4, 2. it is said to be cured by the Jaṅgiḍa plant; in the other 2) viii. 1, 16. it is described as samhanuḥ, ‘bringing the jaws together.’ Weber 3) Indische Studien, 13, 142. argued from the Kauśika Sūtra 4) xxxii. 1. that it was a child's ailment, especially ‘teething.’ Bloomfield 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 283. considers it to mean ‘convulsions,’ while Caland 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen ländischen Gesellschaft, 53, 224; Altindisches Zauberritual, 103. thinks it denotes ‘tetanus.’ Whitney 7) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 42. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 392. decides for ‘lockjaw’ or ‘convulsions.’

jambhaka|जम्भक
जम्भक,<BR> as the name of a demon, presumably identical with the demon causing Jambha, is mentioned in the Vāja saneyi Saṃhitā 1) xxx. 16. and the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka. 2) xii. 25. Cf. Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āranyaka, 67, n. 7.

jayakalauhitya|जयकलौहित्य
जयक लौहित्य<BR> (‘descendant of Lohita’) is mentioned in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 42, 1) as a pupil of Yaśasvin Jayanta Lauhitya.

jayanta|जयन्त
जयन्त<BR> is the name of several teachers in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa: (a) Jayanta Pārāśarya (‘descendant of Parāśara’) is mentioned as a pupil of Vipaścit in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers). 1) iii. 41, 1. (b) Jayanta Vārakya (‘descendant of Varaka’) appears in the same Vaṃśa 1) iii. 41, 1. as a pupil of Kubera Vārakya. His grandtather is also mentioned there as a pupil of Kaṃsa Vārakya. (c) A Jayanta Vārakya, pupil of Suyajña Śāṇḍilya, perhaps identical with the preceding, is found in another Vaṃśa. 2) iv. 17, 1. (d) Jayanta is a name of Yaśasvin Lauhitya. 3) iii. 42, 1. Not only is the formation of the name a late one (cf. Whitney, Sanskrit Grammar, 1209d, and Macdonell, Vedic Grammar 191a), but the Upaniṣad in which it occurs is also a late one. See also Dakṣa Jayanta Lauhitya.

jaraabodha|जराबोध
जरा-बोध,<BR> a word occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) i. 27, 10. is of doubtful meaning. It is held by Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 103. to be the name of a seer. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Nirukta, x. 8. regards it as a mere adjective meaning ‘attending to the invocation,’ which is perhaps the most probable interpretation. Oldenburg, 4) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 23. He compares the ṛṣī bodha-pratibodhau of Av. v. 30, 10. however, thinks that the word is a proper name, the literal sense being ‘alert in old age.’

jaraayu|जरायु
जरायु<BR> is found once in the Atharvaveda 1) i. 27, 1. in the sense of a ‘serpent's skin.’ Usually 2) Rv. v. 78, 8; Av. i. 11, 4; vi. 49, 1; ix. 4, 4; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 6, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 8; xix. 76; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 1, 11, etc; Chāndogya Upanisad, iii. 10. 2, etc. it denotes the outer covering (chorion) of the embryo, as opposed to the ulva, the inner covering (amnion). Living things are occasionally classified according to their mode of origin. In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 3) vi. 3, 1. they are divided into (a) āṇḍa-ja, ‘egg-born’; (b) jīva-ja, ‘born alive,’ or born from the womb; (c) udbhij-ja, ‘propagated by sprouts.’ In the Aitareya Āraṇyaka 4) ii. 6. the division is fourfold: (a) āṇḍa-ja; (b) jāru-ja, that is, jarāyu-ja (found in the Atharvaveda, 5) i. 12, 1. and needlessly read here by Böhtlingk); 6) See jāru in Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 430, 6. Cf. Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 196, 292; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 235. (c) udbhij-ja; and (d) svcda-ja, ‘sweat-born,’ explained as ‘insects.’

jaritR|जरितृ
1. Jaritṛ is the regular term in the Rigveda, 1) i. 2, 2; 165, 14; ii. 33, 11; iii. 60, 7, etc. and occasionally later, 2) Av. v. 11, 8; xx. 135, 1, etc. for a singer of hymns of praise or worshipper.

jaritR|जरितृ
2. Jaritṛ. According to Sieg, 1) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 44 et seq. mention is made in one hymn of the Rigveda 2) x. 142. of Jaritṛ, one of the Śārṅgas. That hymn he seeks to bring into connexion with the epic 3) Mahābhārata, i. 222, 1 et seq. tradition of the Ṛṣi Mandapāla, who wedded Jaritā, a female Śārṅga bird--apparently a hen sparrow (caṭakā)--and had four sons. These being abandoned by him and exposed to the danger of being consumed by a forest fire, prayed to Agni with the hymn Rigveda x. 142. This interpretation is very doubtful, though Sāyaṇa 4) On Rv. x. 142, 7. 8. appears to have adopted it.

jaruutha|जरूथ
जरूथ,<BR> mentioned in three passages of the Rigveda, 1) vii. 1, 7; 9, 6; x. 80. 3. appears to denote a demon defeated by Agni. 2) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Nirukta, vi. 17. Ludwig, however, followed by Griffith, 3) Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 11, n. sees in him a foe slain in a battle in which Vasiṣṭha, the traditional author of the seventh Maṇḍala of the Rigveda, was Purohita, or domestic priest.

jartila|जर्तिल
जर्तिल,<BR> ‘wild sesamum,’ is mentioned in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (v. 4, 3, 2) as an unsuitable sacrificial offering. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ix. 1, 1, 3) sesamum seeds are regarded as combining the qualities of cultivation (viz., edibility) with those of wild growth (because they are produced on unploughed land).

jarvara|जर्वर
जर्वर<BR> was Gṛhapati or ‘householder’ at the snake festival described in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

jalajaatuukarNya|जलजातूकर्ण्य
जल जातूकर्ण्य<BR> (‘descendant of Jātūkarṇa’), is mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xvi. 29, 6) as having obtained the position of Purohita, or domestic priest, of the three peoples or kings of Kāśi, Videha, and Kosala.

jalaaShabheShaja|जलाषभेषज
जलाष-भेषज,<BR> ‘whose remedy is Jalāṣa,’ is an epithet of Rudra in the Rigveda 1) i. 43, 4; viii. 29, 5. and the Atharvaveda. 2) ii. 27, 6. It also occurs in the Nīlarudra Upaniṣad (a very late work), 3, and jalāṣa as an adjective is found in Rv. ii. 33, 7; viii. 33, 6. The word Jālāṣa occurs in a hymn of the Atharvaveda, 3) vi. 57. where it denotes a remedy, perhaps, for a tumour or boil. 4) Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 11, 321 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 489. The commentator on this passage and the Kauśika Sūtra 5) xxxi. 11. regard Jālāṣa as meaning ‘urine,’ which seems a probable interpretation. 6) Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 12, 425 et seq. But Geldner 7) Vedische Studien, 3, 139, n. 2. thinks that rain-water, conceived as urine, is meant; and the Naighaṇṭuka 8) i. 12. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 323, 324; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 76, 77; Hopkins, Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, 1894, cl. identifies jalāṣa and udaka ‘water.’

jaSha|जष
जष<BR> is the name of some aquatic animal or fish in the Atharvaveda 1) xi. 2, 25. There are various readings: jhaṣa, jakha, jagha. and the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 2) v. 5, 13, 1. The commentary on the latter text explains it by makara, probably meaning ‘dolphin.’ The word also occurs in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa. 3) ii. 2, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 96; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 624 Cf. Jhaṣa.

jahakaa|जहका
जहका,<BR> the ‘polecat,’ is mentioned as a victim at the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 18, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 17; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 36. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 86. Sāyaṇa 2) On Taittirīya Saṃhitā, loc. cit. thinks it means a jackal living in holes (vila-vāsī kroṣṭā).

jahnu|जह्नु
जह्नु<BR> occurs only in the plural in the legend of Śunaḥśepa, who is said to have obtained, as Devarāta, both the lordship of the Jahnus and the divine lore of the Gāthins. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 18 (Jahnūnām cādhipatye daive vede ca Gāthinām); Asvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 14; Sāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xv. 27 (p. 195, 1. 21, ed. Hillebrandt, where the reading is different and the sense altered: Jahnūnāṃ cādhitasthire daive vede ca Gāthinaḥ. The two ca's cannot be justified, and the text must be incorrect). A Jāhnava, or descendant of Jahnu, was, according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 2) xxi. 12. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 54, who correctly explains the passage which Sāyaṇa misunderstands. Viśvāmitra, who is said, by means of a certain catū-rātra or ‘four-night’ ritual, to have secured the kingdom for the Jahnus in their conflict with the Vṛcīvants. He is here described as a king. Again, in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 3) vii. 17, 6, 7. Viśvāmitra is addressed as a rāja-putra, ‘prince,’ and Bharatarṣabha, ‘bull of the Bharatas.’ It is therefore clear that the Brāhmaṇas, though not the Saṃhitās, saw in him at once a priest and a prince by origin, though there is no trace whatever of their seeing in him a prince who won Brahmanhood as in the version of the later texts. 4) Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1, 337 et seq. A Jahnāvī is mentioned twice in the Rigveda, 5) i. 116, 19; iii. 58, 6. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 153. being either the wife of Jahnu, or, as Sāyaṇa thinks, the race of Jahnu. The family must clearly once have been a great one, later merged in the Bharatas.

jaatashaakaayanya|जातशाकायन्य
जात शाकायन्य<BR> (‘descendant of Śāka’) is mentioned as a ritual authority and contemporary of Śaṅkha in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (xxii. 7).

jaataruupa|जातरूप
जात-रूप,<BR> ‘possessing native beauty,’ is the name of ‘gold’ in the later Brāhmaṇas 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 13 (jātarūpa-maya, ‘composed of gold’); Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 25; Naighaṇṭuka, i. 2. and the Sūtras. 2) Rajata-jātarūpe, ‘silver and gold,’ Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 6, 24. Cf. viii. 1, 3; Kauśika Sūtra, x. 16; xiii. 3, etc.; Sāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iii. 19, 9.

jaati|जाति
जाति,<BR> which in the Pāli 1) Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 22, n. 4. texts is the word denoting ‘caste,’ does not occur at all in the early Vedic literature; when it is found, as in the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 2) xv. 4, 14. So jātīya, xx. 2, 11, etc. it has only the sense of ‘family’ (for which cf. Kula, Gotra, and Viś). For the influence of the family system on the growth of caste, see Varṇa. To assume that it was the basis of caste, as does Senart, 3) Les Castes dans l'Inde (1896). is difficult in face of the late appearance of words for family and of stress on family. 4) Fick, op. cit., 3; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 51, 267 et seq.

jaatuukarNya|जातूकर्ण्य
जातू-कर्ण्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Jātūkarṇa,’ is the patronymic of several persons. (a) A pupil of Āsurāyaṇa and Yāska bears this name in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad in the Kāṇva recension. 1) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3. In the Mādhyaṃdina 2) ii. 5, 21; iv. 5, 27. he is a pupil of Bhāradvāja. (b) A Kātyāyanī-putra, ‘son of Kātyāyanī,’ bears this name in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka. 3) viii. 10. (c) A Jātūkarṇya is mentioned in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 4) xxvi. 5 (Jātukarṇya in Lindner's index, 159, is a misprint). as a contemporary of Alīkayu Vācaspatya and other sages. (d) Jātūkarṇya is in the Sūtras 5) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v. 3, 3; Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, i. 2, 17; iii. 16, 14; 20, 19; xvi. 29, 6 (Jala); Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, iv. 1, 27; xx. 3, 17; xxv. 7, 34, etc. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 138140. frequently a patronymic of teachers whose identity cannot be determined. The same person or different persons may here be meant.

jaatuuShThira|जातूष्ठिर
जातू-ष्ठिर<BR> occurs in one verse of the Rigveda 1) ii. 13, 11. where Sāyaṇa and Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 152. interpret the word as a proper name. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. (with a wrong reference, ii. 23, 11). renders it as an adjective meaning ‘naturally powerful.’ 4) Urkräftig. Grassmann, Wörterbuch, similarly explains the word as ‘powerful by nature or birth’ (jātū).

jaana|जान
जान,<BR> ‘descendant of Jana,’ is the patronymic of Vṛśa in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 3, 12. and apparently in the Śāṭyāyanaka. 2) In Sāyaṇa on Rv. v. 5. Cf. Bṛhaddevatā, v. 14 et seq., with Macdonell's notes; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 64 et seq. 

jaanaka|जानक
जानक,<BR> ‘descendant of Janaka,’ is the patronymic of Kratuvid in some MSS. of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 1) vii. 34. In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 2) ii. 3, 8, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 1. the name appears instead as Kratujit Jānaki. Jānaka is also, according to some manuscripts of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 3) vi. 3, 10 (Kāṇva). the patronymic of Āyasthūṇa, but is here no doubt a misreading of Jānaki.

jaanaki|जानकि
जानकि,<BR> ‘descendant of Janaka,’ is the patronymic of Kratujit in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 1) ii. 3, 8, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 1. of Kratuvid in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 2) vii. 34. and of Āyasthūṇa in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 3) vi. 3, 10 (Kāṇva = vi. 3, 18. 19, Mādhyaṃdina). where he is mentioned as a pupil of Cūḍa Bhāgavitti, and as teacher of Satyakāma Jābāla.

jaanaMtapi|जानंतपि
जानं-तपि,<BR> ‘descendant of Janaṃtapa,’ is the patronymic of Atyarāti in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 23).

jaanapada|जानपद

jaanashruti|जानश्रुति
जान-श्रुति,<BR> ‘descendant of Jānaśruta,’ is the patronymic of Pautrāyaṇa in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (iv. 1, 1; 2, 1).

jaanashruteya|जानश्रुतेय
जान-श्रुतेय,<BR> ‘descendant of Jānaśruti’ or of ‘Janaśrutā.’ is the patronymic or metronymic of several persons--Upāvi 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 25, 115. or Aupāvi, 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 1, 5. 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 4, 5. Ulukya, 3) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3. Nagarin, 4) Ibid., iii. 40, 2. and Sāyaka. 5) Ibid.

jaabaala|जाबाल
जाबाल,<BR> ‘descendant of Jabāla,’ is the metronymic of Mahāśāla 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 3, 3, 1; 6, 1, 1. and Satyakāma. 2) Ibid., xiii. 5, 3, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 1, 14; vi. 3, 19; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 4, 1, etc.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 7. Jābāla is also mentioned as a teacher in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, 3) iii. 9, 9. which refers to the Jābālas 4) iii. 7, 2. as well. The Jābāla Gṛhapatis are spoken of in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa. 5) xxiii. 5. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 395.

jaabaalaayana|जाबालायन
जाबालायन,<BR> ‘descendant of Jābāla,’ is the patronymic of a teacher, a pupil of Mādhyaṃdināyana, who is mentioned in the second Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Kāṇva recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (iv. 6, 2).

jaamadagniya|जामदग्निय
जामदग्निय<BR> is the patronymic of two ‘descendants of Jamadagni’ in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 1) vii. 1, 9, 1. It appears from the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 2) xxi. 10, 6. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 12, 251, n.; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 54. that the Aurvas are meant, and that Jamadagni's descendants were ever prosperous.

jaamaatR|जामातृ
जामातृ<BR> is a rare word denoting ‘son-in-law’ in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 2, 20. Vāyu is called the jāmātṛ of Tvaṣṭṛ in viii. 26, 21. 22. Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 517; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 78, 79. where also occurs the word Vijāmātṛ, denoting an ‘unsatisfactory son-in-law,’ as one who does not pay a sufficient price, or one who, having other defects, must purchase a bride. Friendly relations between son-in-law and father-in-law are referred to in the Rigveda. 2) x. 28, 1. Cf. Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 255.

jaami|जामि
जामि,<BR> a word which appears originally to have meant ‘related in blood,’ is not rarely used as an epithet of ‘sister’ (Svasṛ), and sometimes even denotes ‘sister’ itself, the emphasis being on the blood-relationship. 1) Cf. Delbrück, Dic indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 463, 464. As ‘relation,’ it occurs, e.g., Rv. i. 31, 10; 75, 3. 4; 100, 11; 124, 6, etc.; as ‘sister,’ Rv. i. 65, 7; x. 10, 10, etc.; with svasā, i. 123, 5; 185, 5; iii. 1, 11; ix. 65, 1; 89, 4, etc. So it appears in a passage of the Atharvaveda, 2) i. 17, 1. where ‘brotherless sisters’ (abhrātara iva jāmayaḥ) are referred to. The word is similarly used in the dispute occurring in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 3) iii. 37. as to the precedence of Rākā, or of the wives of the gods, in a certain rite. One party is there described as holding that the sister should be preferred (jāmyai vai pūrva-peyam)--apparently at a ceremonial family meal--to the wife, presumably as being of one blood with the husband, while the wife is not (being anyodaryā, ‘of another womb’). 4) Delbrück, loc. cit. In the neuter 5) Rv. iii. 54, 9; x. 10, 4; jāmi-kṛt, ‘making relationship,’ Av. iv. 19, 1. Cf. Altareya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. the word means ‘relationship,’ like jāmi-tva, which also occurs in the Rigveda. 6) i. 105, 9; 166, 13; x. 55, 4; 64, 13.

jaamishaMsa|जामिशंस
जामि-शंस,<BR> the ‘imprecation by a sister’ or ‘relation,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 1) ii. 10, 1 (= Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 6, 3), and personified in ix. 4, 15. Cf. jāmyāḥ śapathaḥ, Av. ii. 7, 2; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 362. showing that family disputes were not rare. This is also indicated by the word Bhrātṛvya, which, while properly meaning ‘father's brother's son,’ regularly denotes simply ‘enemy.’

jaambila|जाम्बिल
जाम्बिल,<BR> ‘hollow of the knee,’ 1) Perhaps for jānu-bila. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 11, n. 4. occurs once in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 2) iii. 15, 3. The word also occurs in the form of Jāmbīla in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 3) v. 13, 1. and the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 4) xxv. 3. Mahīdhara, in his commentary on the latter text, interprets the word as ‘knee-pan,’ which he says is so named because of its resemblance to the citron, jāmbīra.

jaayantiiputra|जायन्तीपुत्र
जायन्ती-पुत्र,<BR> ‘son of Jāyantī,’ is mentioned in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1) vi. 5, 2 (Kāṇva = vi. 4, 32 Mādhyaṃdina). as a pupil of Māṇḍūkāyanīputra.

jaayaa|जाया
जाया<BR> regularly denotes ‘wife,’ and, as opposed to Patnī, wife as an object of marital affection, the source of the continuance of the race. 1) Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 411, 412. Cf. Rv. i. 105, 2; 124, 7; iii. 53, 4; iv. 3, 2; 18, 3; ix. 82, 4; x. 10, 7; 17, 1; 71, 4, etc.; Av. iii. 30, 2; vi. 60, 1, etc. So it is used of the wife of the gambler, and of the wife of the Brāhmaṇa in the Rigveda; 2) x. 34, 2. 3. 13, and x. 109. it is also frequently combined with Pati, ‘husband,’ 3) Rv. iv. 3, 2; x. 149, 4. both there and in the later literature. 4) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 23, 1. Cf. vii. 13, 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 6, 7, 9. Cf. Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 6, 12. Patnī, on the other hand, is used to denote the wife as partner in the sacrifice; 5) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 9, 2, 14. when no share in it is assigned to her, she is called Jāyā. 6) i. 1, 4, 13. The distinction is, of course, merely relative; hence one text 7) Ibid., i. 1, 4, 16. calls Manu's wife Jāyā, another 8) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 8, 1. Patnī. Later on Jāyā is superseded by Dāra.

jaayaanya|जायान्य
जायान्य,<BR> 1) Av. vii. 76, 3-5; xix. 44, 2. Jāyenya, 2) ii. 3, 5, 2; 5, 6, 5. are variant forms of the name of a disease mentioned in the Atharvaveda and the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. In one passage of the former text 3) xix. 44, 2. it is mentioned with jaundice (harimā) and pains in the limbs (aṅga-bhedo visalpakaḥ). Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 377, following Wise, Hindu System of Medicint, 321, describing Akṣata. thinks these are its symptoms, and identifies it with a kind of Yakṣma, or disease of the lungs. Bloomfield 5) American Journal of Philology, 11, 320 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 559-561. prefers to identify it with syphilis, in accordance with certain indications in the ritual of the Kauśika Sūtra. 6) xxxii. 11. Cf. also the commentary on Av. vii. 76, and Taittirīya Saṃhitā, loc. cit. Roth conjectures ‘gout,’ but Whitney 7) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 442. Cf. Henry, Lelivre vii de l' Atharvavéda, 98. leaves the nature of the disease doubtful.

jaara|जार
जार,<BR> ‘lover,’ has no sinister sense in the early texts 1) Rv. i. 66, 8; 117, 18; 134, 3; 152, 4; ix. 32, 5, etc. The word is often used mythologically, as, e.g., jāra uṣasām, ‘lover of the dawns,’ vii. 9, 1. Cf Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 308. generally, where the word applies to any lover. But it seems probable that the Jāra at the Puruṣamedha, or human sacrifice, 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 9; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 4. 1. must be regarded as an illegitimate lover; this sense also appears in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 3) vi. 4, 11. and Indra is styled the lover of Ahalyā, wife of Gautama 4) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 65.

jaaratkaarava|जारत्कारव
जारत्-कारव<BR> (‘descendant of Jaratkāru’) Ārtabhāga (‘descendant of Ṛtabhāga’) is the name of a teacher mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka (vii. 20) and the Bṛhadāranyaka Upaniṣad (iii. 2, 1, in both recensions).

jaaru|जारु
जारु<BR> See Jarāyu.

jaala|जाल
जाल<BR> occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 8. 5. 3 (as used against foes); x. 1, 30. and the Sūtras 2) Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, vii. 4, 7. etc. in the sense of ‘net.’ Jālaka is used in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3) iv. 2, 3. of a reticulated membrane resembling a woven covering.

jaalaaSha|जालाष
जालाष<BR> See Jalāṣa, which is read by Sāyaṇa in the Atharvaveda (vi. 57, 2) for Jālāṣa. 1) Cf. Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 11, 320.

jaaShkamada|जाष्कमद
जाष्कमद<BR> is the name of an unknown animal in the Atharvaveda. 1) xi. 9, 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 88.

jaaspati|जास्पति
जास्-पति<BR> occurs once in the Rigveda 1) i. 135. 8. in the sense of the ‘head of the family.’ The abstract formed from this word, Jās-patya, apparently denoting ‘lordship of children,’ is also found there. 2) Rv. v. 28, 3; x. 85, 23.

jaahuSha|जाहुष
जाहुष<BR> is the name in the Rigveda 1) i. 116, 10; vii. 71, 5 Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159. of a protégé of the Aśvins. 

jaahnava|जाह्नव
जाह्नव,<BR> ‘descendant of Jahnu,’ is the patronymic of Viśvāmitra in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxi. 12. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 32; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 54. This fact is of some importance as disproving Aufrecht's theory 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 424. that the Jahnus were the clan of Ajīgarta the father of Śunaḥśepa.

jitvanshailini|जित्वन्शैलिनि
जित्वन् शैलिनि<BR> is the name of a teacher in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 1) iv. 1, 2 (Kāṇva = iv. 1, 5 Mādhyaṃdina, which has Śailina as the patronymic). a contemporary of Janaka and Yājñavalkya. He held that speech (vāc) was Brahman.

jihvaavantbaadhyoga|जिह्वावन्त्बाध्योग
जिह्वावन्त् बाध्योग<BR> is the name, in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 1) vi. 5, 3 (Kāṇva = vi. 4, 33 Mādhyaṃdina). of a teacher, pupil of Asita Vārṣāgaṇa.

jiivagRbh|जीवगृभ्
जीव-गृभ्,<BR> ‘seizing alive,’ is, according to Roth, 1) St Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Siebenzig Lieder, 174. the term for a police official in the Rigveda. 2) x. 97, 11. But although this sense is rendered possible by the mention of Madhyamaśī, perhaps ‘arbitrator,’ in the same passage, 3) Rv. x. 97, 12. it is neither necessary nor probable. 4) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 180.

jiivaja|जीवज
जीव-ज<BR> See Jarāyu.

jiivant|jiivat|जीवत्|जीवन्त्
जीवन्त्<BR> appears to denote a certain plant in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) xix. 39, 3. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 960. where the edition of Roth and Whitney has the unjustified emendation Jīvala. 2) With this conjectural form, cf. Jīvalā, an epithet of a plant in Av. vi. 59, 3; viii. 2, 6; 7, 6; xix. 39. 3. 

jiivalachallaki|जीवलचल्लकि
जीवल चल्लकि,<BR> ‘descendant of Celaka,’ is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) ii. 3, 1, 31-35. Cf. Lévi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 140. as reproving Takṣan.

juhuu|जुहू
जुहू<BR> is the regular name in the Rigveda and later for the tongue-shaped ladle in which butter was offered to the gods. 1) Rv. viii. 44, 5; x. 21, 3; Av. xviii. 4, 5. 6, etc.

juurNi|जूर्णि
जूर्णि,<BR> ‘firebrand,’ is regarded by Zimmer 1) Altindisches Leben, 301. as one of the weapons of the Vedic Indians. But since it is only mentioned in the Rigveda 2) i. 129, 8. Cf. Nirukta, vi. 4. as a weapon used by demons, its employment in normal war cannot be safely assumed.

juurNii|जूर्णी
जूर्णी<BR> is one of the names given to serpents in a hymn of the Atharvaveda (ii. 24, 5), perhaps from their habit of casting their slough. See Ahi.

jetR|जेतृ
जेतृ<BR> See Sṛṇi.

jaitraayaNasahojit|जैत्रायणसहोजित्
जैत्रायण सहो-जित्<BR> is apparently in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 1) xviii. 5. the name of a prince who celebrated the Rājasūya, or ‘royal consecration.’ Von Schroeder 2) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft, 49, 168. quotes in support of Jaitrāyaṇa as a proper name the derivative Jaitrāyaṇi, ‘descendant of Jaitra,’ formed according to the Gaṇa karṇādi, which is referred to by Pāṇini; 3) iv. 2, 80. but it should be noted that in the parallel passage of the Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā 4) xxviii. 5, cited by von Schroeder Kāṭhaka, 1, p. 269. the reading is different, and no proper personal name appears, the subject being Indra, the god. This reading seems much more probable, for the verse should be general, and suit every king performing the rite. 

jaimini|जैमिनि
जैमिनि<BR> does not appear till the Sūtra period. 1) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 4; Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 10; vi. 6, etc. He appears also as a pupil of Vyāsa, Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa, ad fin.; Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 377. Cf. his Indian Literature, 56. But a Jaiminīya Saṃhitā of the Sāmaveda is extant, and has been edited and discussed by Caland; 2) As part ii. of Hillebrandt's Indische Forschungen, Breslau, 1907. See Oldenberg, Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1908, 712 et seq. and a Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, of which a special section is the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, 3) Edited by Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 79-260. is known and has formed the subject of several articles by Oertel. 4)Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 15 et seq.; 19, 97; 23, 325, 26, 176, 306; 28, 81; Actes du onzieme Congres International des Orientalistes, 1, 225; Transactions of the Connectieut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 155 et seq.

jaivantaayana|जैवन्तायन
जैवन्तायन,<BR> ‘descendant of Jīvanta,’ is mentioned in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1) iv. 5, 26 (Mādhyaṃdina). The name is recognised by Pāṇini, iv. 1, 103. as a teacher, with Śaunaka and Raibhya, of Rauhiṇāyana.

jaivala|जैवल
जैवल<BR> or Jaivali, ‘descendant of Jīvala,’ is the patronymic of Pravāhaṇa in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 1) vi. 2, 1 (Kāṇva = vi. 1, 1 Mādhyaṃdina), where the form is Jaivala. and Chāndogya Upaniṣads. 2) i. 8, 1. 2. 8; v. 3, 1. Jaivali, the king, in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 3) i. 38, 4. is the same person.

JNaatR|ज्ञातृ
ज्ञातृ<BR> occurs in two passages of the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 32, 3; viii. 8, 21. and one of the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 2) xii. 14. Cf. Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 66, n. 4. with a somewhat obscure sense. Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 181. conjectures not unnaturally that the word is a technical term taken from law, meaning ‘witness.’ The reference is, perhaps, to a custom of carrying on transactions of business before witnesses as practised in other primitive societies. 4) In Manu, viii. 57, the word is a various reading for sākṣin, ‘witness.’ Cf. Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 140. Roth 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. suggests that the word has the sense of ‘surety.’ But Bloomfield 6) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 475. and Whitney 7) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 306. ignore these interpretations.

JNaati|ज्ञाति
ज्ञाति<BR> (masc.), a word which originally seems to have meant ‘acquaintance,’ 1) Being in all probability derived from jñā, ‘know,’ not from jan, ‘beget,’ as would at first sight seem more likely on account of the sense. Cf. the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. denotes in the Rigveda 2) vii. 55, 5, seems to refer to the members of the joint family sleeping in the paternal house; x. 66, 14; 85, 28 (the kinsmen of the bride are meant); 117, 9 (perhaps ‘brother and sister’ are meant by jñātī here, but ‘kinsfolk’ will do; of. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 432). and later 3) Av. xii. 5, 44 (where Whitney in his Translation renders the word by ‘acquaintances,’ which seems too vague and feeble); Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 5, 2; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 4, 3 (jñātibhyāṃ vā sakhibhyāṃ, vā, ‘where ‘relations’ are contrasted with ‘friends’ or ‘companions’); ii. 2, 2, 20; 5, 2, 20; xi. 3, 3, 7, etc. a ‘relation,’ apparently one who was connected by blood on the father's side, though the passages do not necessarily require the limitation. But this sense follows naturally enough from the patriarchal basis of Vedic society. 4) For the transition from the etymological meaning, cf. , which in Homer designate ‘brother’ and ‘sister’; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

jyaa|ज्या
ज्या<BR> is the regular word for ‘bowstring’ in the Rigveda 1) iv. 27, 3; vi. 75, 3; x. 51, 6, etc. and later. 2) Av. i. 1, 3; v. 13, 6; vi. 42, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 9; xxix. 51, etc. The making of bowstrings was a special craft, as is shown by the occurrence of the Jyā-kāra, or ‘maker of bowstrings,’ among the victims at the Puruṣamedha, or human sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 3) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 7; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 3, 1. The bowstring consisted of a thong of ox-hide. 4) Rv. vi. 75, 3; Av. i. 1, 3. In the Epic the bowstring is made of hemp (maurvī); Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 271. It was not usually kept taut, 5) Av. vi. 42, 1. but was specially tightened when the bow was to be used. 6) Rv. x. 166, 3. The sound of the bowstring (jyā-ghoṣa) is referred to in the Atharvaveda. 7) v. 21, 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 298 299. Cf. Ārtnī. 

jyaakaa|ज्याका
ज्याका<BR> means ‘bowstring,’ with a contemptuous sense, in the Rigveda, 1) x. 133, 1, where anyakeṣāṃ jyākāḥ is unmistakably contemptuous. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 137. and in the simple sense in the Atharvaveda. 2) i. 2, 2.

jyaapaasha|ज्यापाश
ज्या-पाश<BR> means ‘bowstring’ in the Atharvaveda (xi. 10, 22).

jyaahroDa|ज्याह्रोड
ज्या-ह्रोड<BR> occurs in the description of the arms of the Vrātya in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 1) xvii. 1, 14 (spelt -hṇoḍa in text, -hnoḍa in comm.). and is also mentioned in the Sūtras. 2) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxii. 4, 11 (spelt -hroḍa); Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 6, 8 (spelt -hnoḍa: the editor notes that the Drāhyāyaṇa Sūtra has the same reading). The sense is somewhat obscure, for one Sūtra describes it as a ‘bow not meant for use’ (ayogyaṃ dhanus), 3) Kātyāyana, loc. cit. while the other speaks of it as a ‘bow without an arrow’ (dhanuṣka aniṣu). 4) Lāṭyāyana, loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 38; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Acad my of Arts and Sciences, 15, 32; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 33, 52. Some sort of a bow, therefore, seems to be meant.

jyeShTha|ज्येष्ठ
ज्येष्ठ,<BR> ordinarily meaning ‘greatest,’ has further the specific sense of ‘eldest’ 1) With changed accent, jyeṣṭhá. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 83, 14. brother in the Rigveda. 2) iv. 33, 5; x. 11, 2. It also means the eldest among sons, which is another side of the same sense. 3) Av. xii. 2, 35; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 17; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 3, 8, and cf. Jyaiṣthineya.

jyeShThaghnii|ज्येष्ठघ्नी
ज्येष्ठ-घ्नी,<BR> ‘slaying the eldest,’ is the name of a Nakṣatra, or lunar mansion, usually called Jyeṣṭhā, in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 110, 2. Cf. vi. 112, 1. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 2) i. 5, 2, 8. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 361. It is Antares or Cor Scipionis.

jyeShThaa|ज्येष्ठा
ज्येष्ठा<BR> See Nakṣatra. 

jyaiShThineya|ज्यैष्ठिनेय
ज्यैष्ठिनेय<BR> denotes, in combination with Jyeṣṭha, the eldest,’ a ‘son of the father's first wife’ (jyeṣṭhā), in the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 8, 1 (opposed to haniṣṭha and hāniṣṭhineya); Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2; xx. 5, 2.

jyotiSha|ज्योतिष
ज्योतिष,<BR> ‘astronomy.’ It is important to note that no reference to any work on astronomy occurs in the Saṃhitās or Brāhmaṇas. The text which claims to represent the astronomical science of the Veda has been edited by Weber, 1) Ueber den Vedakalender namens Jyotiṣam (1862). and has frequently been discussed since. 2) See references in Thibaut, Astrenomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 20, 29. Its date is unknown, but is undoubtedly late, as is shown alike by the contents and form of the work.

jvaalaayana|ज्वालायन
ज्वालायन,<BR> ‘descendant of Jvāla,’ is the name of a man, a pupil of Gauṣūkti, mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iv. 16, 1), in a list of teachers. JH.

jhaSha|झष
झष<BR> is mentioned in the story of Manu told in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) i. 8, 1, 4. where it means a ‘great fish’ (mahā-matsya) according to the commentator. Eggeling 2) Sacred Books of the East, 12, 217, n. 3; 26, xxxi. suggests that a horned fish is meant, because in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 3) i. 7, 1; ii. 6, 7. the Iḍā, or personified libation, is represented as a cow, and this may have brought in the idea of a horned fish in the later form of an old legend. But cf. Jaṣa. T.

takavaana|तकवान
तकवान<BR> appears to be a patronymic from Taku, 1) Cf. Bhṛgavāṇa, from Bhṛgu; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Taku, as an adjective(?), occurs in Rigveda, ix. 97, 52. and to be the name of a seer in the Rigveda, 2) i. 120, 6. presumably a descendant of Taku Kakṣīvant, for his name occurs in a group of hymns composed by the Kākṣīvatas. 3) Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 221. Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 92; Ludwig, U7ber Methode bei Interpretation des Ṛgveda, 47.

takman|तक्मन्
तक्मन्<BR> is a disease repeatedly mentioned in the Atharvaveda, but later not known under this name. It is the subject of five hymns 1) i. 25; v. 22; vi. 20; vii. 116; xix. 39 (cf. v. 4). of the Atharvaveda, and is often mentioned elsewhere. 2) Av. iv. 9, 8; v. 4. 1. 9; 30, 16; ix. 8, 6; xi. 2, 22. 26, etc. Weber 3) Indische Studien, 4, 119; Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschishte des Weda, 39, had, from the use of Kuṣṭha as a remedy, regarded it as denoting ‘leprosy,’ and was followed by Pictet, Kuhn's Zeitschrift 5, 337. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 4, 280, thought ‘consumption’ was meant. first identified it with ‘fever,’ and Grohmann 4) Indische Studien, 9, 381 et seq. showed that all the symptoms pointed to that ailment. 5) See also Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 451 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 379-385, and compare the jvara (a non-Vedic word) of the classical medicine, Wise, Hindu System of Medicine, 219 et seq.; Jolly, Medicin, 70-72. Dārila and Keśava, the commentators on the Kauśika Sūtra, everywhere equate takman and jvara. Reference is made to the alternate hot and shivering fits of the patient, 6) Av. i. 25, 2-4; v. 22, 2. 7. 10; vi. 20, 3; vii. 116, 1. to the yellow colour of the jaundice which accompanies the fever, 7) Av. i. 25, 2; v. 22, 2; vi. 20, 3. and to its peculiar periodicity. The words used to describe its varieties are anye-dyuḥ, 8) Av. i. 25, 4; vii. 116, 2. ubhaya-dyuḥ, 9) Ibid. tṛtīyaka, 10) Av. i. 25, 4; v. 22, 13; xix. 39, 10. vi-tṛtīya, 11) Av. v. 22, 13. and sadaṃ-di, 12) Av. v. 22, 13; xix. 39, 10. the exact sense of most of which terms is somewhat uncertain. It is agreed 13) Grohmann, op. cit., 387; Zimmer, op. cit., 382; Bloomfield, op. cit., 274. that the first epithet designates the fever known as quotidianus, which recurs each day at the same hour, though the word is curious (lit. ‘on the other--i.e., next, day’). The ubhaya-dyuḥ (‘on both days’) variety appears to mean a disease recurring for two successive days, the third being free; this corresponds to the rhythmus quartanus complicatus. 14) Grohmann, 388; Zimmer, 382; Bloomfield, 274. It may conceivably be the form styled Cāturthaka Viparyaya (Wise, op. cit., 232), in which the paroxysm occurs every fourth day, and lasts for two days. But Sāyaṇa considers that it means a fever recurring on the third day, the ‘tertian.’ The tṛtīyaka, however, must be the ‘tertian’ fever, 15) Sāyaṇa on Av. i. 25, 4; Bloomfield, 451. It is the jvara tṛtīyaka of Suśruta (2, 404, 7). though Zimmer 16) Op. cit., 383, quoting Hügel, Kashmir, 1, 133. suggests that it may mean a fever which is fatal at the third paroxysm. Grohmann 17) Op. cit., 388. regards the vi-tṛtīyaka as equivalent to the tertiana duplicata, a common form in southern countries, in which the fever occurs daily, but with a correspondence in point of time or severity of attack on alternate days. Bloomfield 18) Op. cit., 451. suggests that it is identical with the ubhaya-dyuḥ variety. The sadaṃ-di 19) Of doubtful derivation: either ‘always cutting’ (of Sāyaṇa on Av. xix. 39, 10), or ‘always fastening upon’ (Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.), or ‘belonging to every day’ = sadaṃdina (Zimmer, 383, n.; Bloomfield, 452). type appears to be the kind later known as saṃtata-jvara (‘continuous fever’), in which there are attacks of several days’ duration, with an interval followed by a fresh period of attack. Fever occurred at different seasons, in the autumn (śārada), in the hot weather (graiṣma), in the rains (vārṣika), 20) Av. v. 22, 13. but was especially prevalent in the first, as is indicated by the epithet viśva-śārada, ‘occurring every autumn.’ 21) Av. ix. 8, 6; xix. 34, 10. The disease is said to arise when Agni enters the waters. 22) Av. 1, 25. 1. From this Weber 23) Indische Studien, 4, 119. deduced that it was considered to be the result of a chill supervening on heat, or the influence of heat on marshy land. Grohmann 24) Ibid., 9, 493. preferred to see in this connexion of the origin of the disease with Agni's entering the waters 25) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. an allusion to the fact that fever arises in the rainy season, the time when Agni, as lightning, descends to earth with the rain. Zimmer. 26) Of. cit., 384. who accepts this view, further refers to the prevalence of fever in the Terai, and interprets vanya, an epithet of fever found in the Atharvaveda, 27) Av. vi. 20, 4. as meaning ‘sprung from the forest,’ pointing out that fever is mentioned as prevalent among the Mūjavants and Mahāvṛṣas, two mountain tribes of the western Himālaya. 28) Av. v. 22, 5. There is no trace of fever having been observed to be caused by the bite of the anopheles mosquito, which breeds in stagnant water: this theory has without reason been held to be known to classical Indian medicine. 29) Jolly, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1906, 222. Among the symptoms of Takman, or among complications accompanying it, are mentioned ‘itch’ (Pāman), ‘headache’ (śīrṣa-śoka), 30) Av. xix. 39, 10. For the present position of the disease in India, cf. the Report of the Simla Conference of 1909. ‘cough’ (Kāsikā), and ‘consumption,’ or perhaps some form of itch (Balāsa). It is perhaps significant that the Takman does not appear until the Atharvaveda. It is quite possible that the Vedic Āryans, when first settled in India, did not know the disease, which would take some generations to become endemic and recognized as dangerous. What remedies they used against it is quite uncertain, for the Atharvaveda mentions only spells and the Kuṣṭha, which can hardly have been an effective remedy, though still used in later times. Fever must, even in the Atharvan period, have claimed many victims, or it would not be mentioned so prominently.

takvan|तक्वन्
तक्वन्,<BR> 1) Rv. i. 66, 2. Cf. i. 134, 5, and Tsārin. Takvarī, 2) Ibid., i. 151, 5; x. 91, 2. But in both places the word may be adjectival. seem in the Rigveda to denote a ‘swiftflying bird.’ Sāyaṇa 3) On Rv. i. 66, 2. explains Takvan as a swift steed.

taxakavaishaaleya|तक्षकवैशालेय
तक्षक वैशालेय<BR> (‘descendant of Viśālā’) is a mythical figure, mentioned as the son of Virāj in the Atharvaveda, 1) vii. 10, 29. and as Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin priest at the snake sacrifice in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 2) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35. 

taxan|तक्षन्
1. Takṣan, ‘carpenter,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) ix. 112, 1. and often later. 2) Av. x. 6, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 10; xviii. 13; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 27; xxx. 6; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 2, 1; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 3, 12; iii. 6, 4, 4, etc. He was employed to do all sorts of work in wood, such as the making of chariots (Ratha) and wagons (Anas). Carved work of a finer type seems also to have fallen to his lot. 3) Rv. x. 86, 5; Av. xix. 49, 8. Cf. Rv. i. 161, 9; iii. 60. 2. The axe (kuliśa, 4) Rv. iii. 2, 1. paraśu) 5) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 10. is mentioned as one of his tools, and perhaps the Bhurij, a word which is, however, uncertain in sense. In one passage of the Rigveda 6) Rv. i. 105, 18. Cf. Roth, Nirukta, Erläuterungen, 67; Oldenberg. ṚgvedaNoten, 1, 100. reference seems to be made to the pains of the carpenter in bending over his work. That the carpenters were a low caste, or formed a separate class of the people, is certainly not true of Vedic times. 7) Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 210, n. 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 245, 253.

taxan|तक्षन्
2. Takṣan is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) ii. 3, 1, 31-35. Cf. Lévi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 140. as a teacher whose view of a certain formula was not accepted by Jīvala Cailaki.

taxan|तक्षन्
3. Takṣan. See Bṛbu.

taNDula|तण्डुल
तण्डुल,<BR> ‘grain,’ especially ‘rice grain,’ is mentioned very often in the Atharvaveda 1) x. 9, 26; xi. 1, 18; xii. 3, 18. 29. 30. and later, 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 6; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 1, etc.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 4, 3; ii. 5, 3, 4; v. 2, 3, 2; vi. 6, 1, 8, etc.; śyāmāka-taṇḍula, ‘millet grain,’ ibid., x. 6, 3, 2; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iii. 14, 3; apāmārga-taṇḍula, ‘grain of the Achyranthes aspera,’ v. 2, 4, 15, etc. but not in the Rigveda. This accords with the fact that rice cultivation seems hardly known in the Rigveda. 3) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 239. See Vrīhi. Husked (karṇa) and unhusked (akarṇa) rice is referred to in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 4) i. 8, 9, 3. See Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 190. 

tata|तत
तत,<BR> ‘dada,’ is the pet name for ‘father’ in the Rigveda 1) viii. 91, 6; ix. 112, 3. and later. 2) Av. v. 24, 16; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 5, 5; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 9, 7; in the vocative as a form of address, Av. viii. 4, 77; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 14; vii. 15; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, i. 3, 3. Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 449. Cf. Tāta and Pitṛ.

tataamaha|ततामह
ततामह,<BR> ‘grandfather,’ is found in the Atharvaveda. 1) v. 24, 17; viii. 4, 76. It seems to mean literally ‘great father,’ and to be an analogical formation following pitāmaha; Delbrück, op. cit., 473, 474.

tanaya|तनय
तनय,<BR> n., denotes ‘offspring,’ ‘descendants’ in the Rigveda, 1) i. 96, 4; 183, 3; 184, 5; ii. 23, 19; vii. 1, 21, etc.; tokaṃ ca tanayaṃ ca, i. 92, 13; ix. 74, 5. Cf. vi. 25, 4; 31, 1; 66, 8; and i. 31, 12, as explained by Pischel, Vedische Studien, 3, 193. where also it is often used adjectivally with Toka. 2) Rv. i. 64, 14; 114, 6; 147, 1; 189, 2; ii. 30, 5, etc.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7. There seems no ground for the view 3) Nirukta, x. 7; xii. 6. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Tan, tana, and tanas, have the same sense as Tanaya. See Rv. vi. 46, 12; 49, 13; vii. 104, 10; viii. 68, 12, etc. (tan); viii. 25, 2 (tana); v. 70, 4 (tanas). that toka means ‘sons,’ ‘children,’ and tanaya ‘grandchildren.’

tanti|तन्ति
तन्ति<BR> occurs in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) vi. 24, 4. where Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. renders the plural of the word by ‘files’ of calves. But it seems rather to have the sense which it has in the later literature, of ‘cords,’ here used to fasten the calves.

tantu|तन्तु
तन्तु<BR> appears properly to mean ‘thread,’ and in particular the ‘warp’ of a piece of weaving, as opposed to Otu, the ‘woof.’ Both senses are found in the Atharvaveda. 1) xiv. 2, 51 (opposed to otu); xv. 3, 6 (the prāñcaḥ and tiryañcaḥ threads or cords of the throne of the Vrātya [Āsandī]). In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) iii. 1, 2, 18; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 8, 9. the ‘warp’ is called anuchāda, the ‘woof’ paryāsa, the tantavaḥ being the ‘threads.’ In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 3) vi. 1, 1, 4. on the other hand, the ‘warp’ is prācīna-tāna, the ‘woof’ otu. The threads or cords of the throne (Pary ṅka) are referred to in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad. 4) i. 5; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 20, n. 2. In the Rigveda the word is used only metaphorically, and this is its most frequent use even in the Brāhmanas. 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. It is applied to the filaments of plants in Rv. x. 134, 5; to the spider's web in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upanisad. ii. 1, 23. See also Vāṇa.

tantra|तन्त्र
तन्त्र<BR> means, like Tantu, the ‘warp’ of a piece of weaving, or more generally the ‘web’ itself. It is found in the Rigveda 1) x. 71, 9. and later. 2) Av. x. 7, 42; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 5, 3; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, x. 5; Śatapa ha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 2, 2, 22. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 254.

tapas|तपस्
तपस्, तपस्य<BR> See Māsa.

taponitya|तपोनित्य
तपो-नित्य<BR> (‘constant in penance’) Pauru-śiṣṭi (‘descendant of Puruśiṣṭa’) is the name of a teacher in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad (i. 9, 1) who believed in the value of penance (tapas).

tayaadara|तयादर
तयादर<BR> is the name of an animal only mentioned in the adjectival form tāyādara along with Parasvant, ‘wild ass’(?) in the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 72, 2. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 335.

taraxu|तरक्षु
तरक्षु,<BR> the ‘hyæna,’ is mentioned in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 19, 1, where Sāyaṇa explains the animal to be ‘a kind of tiger with an ass's appearance’ (vyāghra-viśeṣo gardabhākāraḥ); Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 21; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 40. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 81. 

taranta|तरन्त
तरन्त<BR> appears, along with Purumīḍha, as a patron of Śyāvāśva in the Rigveda. 1) v. 61, 10. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 2) xiii. 7, 12. and other Brāhmaṇas 3) Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 139; Śāṭyāyanaka apud Sāyaṇa on Rv. ix. 38, 3 = Sāmaveda, ii. 410. he, together with Purumīḍha, is described as receiving gifts from Dhvasra 4) Rv. ix. 58, 3. and Puruṣanti; but since the receipt of gifts was forbidden to Kṣatriyas, they for the nonce became Ṛṣis, and composed a passage in honour of the donors. 4) Rv. ix. 58. 3. He, like Purumīḍha, was a Vaidadaśvi, or son of Vidadaśva. 5) Cf. Rv. v. 61, 10; notes 2 and 3. This is merely a misunderstanding of the Rv. Cf. Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 39; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 50 et seq.; 62, 63; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 232, n. 1; Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 353, 354, where he points out that the Brāhmaṇa tradition, and that of the Bṛhaddevatā (v. 50-81, with Macdonell's notes), are not to be accepted as real explanations of the Rigveda.

taru|तरु
तरु,<BR> the usual term for ‘tree’ in classical Sanskrit, never occurs in Vedic literature, except perhaps in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) v. 44, 5. where Sāyaṇa finds it, and where it can be so translated. But the form (tarubhiḥ) is probably to be interpreted otherwise. 2) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., cites tarobhiḥ in Rv. ii. 39, 3, as a parallel, and so Oldenberg, ṚgvedaNoten, 1, 341.

taruxa|तरुक्ष
तरुक्ष<BR> is the name of a man in the Rigveda 1) viii. 46, 32. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 391; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 117. who is mentioned along with Balbūtha, the Dāsa, in a Dāna-stuti, or ‘Praise of Gifts.’

tarku|तर्कु
तर्कु,<BR> ‘spindle,’ is known only in Vedic literature from the mention of it in Yāska's Nirukta (ii. 1) as an example of the transposition of letters, the word being derived, according to him, from the root kart, ‘to spin.’ 

tarda|तर्द
तर्द,<BR> ‘borer,’ occurs in a hymn of the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 50, 1. 2. enumerating insects that injure grain. Whitney 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 318. suggests that a kind of mouse or rat may be meant. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 485. thought a bird was denoted.

tardman|तर्द्मन्
तर्द्मन्<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) xiv. 1, 40. applies to the hole in the yoke (Yuga). In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) iii. 2, 1, 2; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 26, n. 1. it designates a hole in a skin.

tarya|तर्य
तर्य<BR> is, according to Sāyaṇa, the name of a man in one passage of the Rigveda. 1) v, 44, 12. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158, 159. But the verse is hopelessly obscure. 2) Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 342.

talaasha|तलाश
तलाश<BR> is the name of a tree in the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 15, 3. Whitney 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 291. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62. suggests that it may be the same as tālīśa (Flacourtia cataphracta).

talpa|तल्प
तल्प<BR> is the regular term for ‘bed’ or ‘couch’ from the Rigveda and the Atharvaveda 1) Rv. vii. 55, 8; Av. v. 17, 12; xiv. 2, 31. 41. onwards. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 6, 4; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 5, 3; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxiii. 4, 2; xxv. 1, 10. One made of Udumbara wood is mentioned in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 3) i. 2, 6, 5. The violation of the bed of a Guru, or teacher, is already mentioned in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 4) v. 10, 9. while the adjective talpya, ‘born in the nuptial couch,’ denotes ‘legitimate’ in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 5) xiii. 1, 6, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 154. 

talava|तलव
तलव<BR> in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha, or human sacrifice, in the Yajurveda, 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 20; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 15, 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 83, n. 15. denotes a ‘musician’ of some kind.

taShTR|तष्टृ
तष्टृ<BR> is found in the Rigveda 1) i. 61, 4; 105, 18; 130, 4; iii. 38, 1; vii. 32, 20; x. 93, 12; 119, 5. Cf. Nirukta, v. 21. in the sense of ‘carpenter,’ like Takṣan, which is from the same root takṣ, ‘to fashion.’

tasara|तसर
तसर<BR> denotes the weaver's ‘shuttle’ in the Rigveda 1) x. 130, 2. and the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 83; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 9; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxviii. 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 4, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 254.

taskara|तस्कर
तस्कर<BR> occurs in the Rigveda 1) i. 191, 5; vi. 27, 3; vii. 55, 3; viii. 29, 6. and frequently later, 2) Av. iv. 3, 2; xix. 47, 7; 50, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 77-78; xii. 62; xvi. 21, etc; Nirukta, iii. 14. denoting ‘thief’ or ‘robber.’ It appears to be practically synonymous with Stena, in connexion with which it is often mentioned. 3) Rv. vii. 55. 3; Av. xix. 47, 7; 50, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 79; xvi. 21, etc. The Stena and the Taskara are contrasted in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 4) xi. 79 (the Malimlu is janeṣu, ‘among men’; the others vane, ‘in the forest’). Cf. for the Malimlu, Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 3, 2, 6; Atharvaveda, xix. 49, 10. with the Malimlu, who is a burglar or house-breaker, while they are highwaymen, or, as the Rigveda 5) x. 4, 6. puts it, ‘men who haunt the woods and risk their lives’ (tanū-tyajā vanar-gū). In another passage of the Rigveda, 6) vii. 55, 3. however, the dog is told to bark at the Taskara or the Stena, which clearly points to an attempt at house-breaking. The thief goes about at night, 7) Rv. i. 191, 5. and knows the paths 8) Rv. viii. 29, 6. on which he attacks his victim. In one passage of the Rigveda 9) x. 4, 6. the use of cords is mentioned, but whether to bind the thieves when captured, or to bind the victim, is not clear. 10) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 178, n. The Atharvaveda 11) xix. 50, 5. Cf. Rv. x. 97, 10 (stena). refers to the Stena and the Taskara as cattle and horse thieves. 12) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 984.

taayu|तायु
तायु<BR> was another name for thief, perhaps of a less distinguished and more domestic character than the highwayman, for though he is referred to as a cattle-thief, 13) Rv. i. 65, 1; vii. 86, 5. he is also alluded to as a stealer of clothes (vastra-mathi) 14) Rv. iv. 38, 5. and as a debtor. 15) Rv. vi. 12, 5. No doubt this theft is the result of despair at being in debt, which might lead to loss of liberty (Ṛṇa). In one passage the Tāyus are said to disappear at the coming of dawn (which is elsewhere called yāvayad-dveṣas, ‘driving away hostile beings,’ and ṛta-pā, ‘guardian of order’), like the stars of heaven (nakṣatra). 16) Rv. i. 50, 2. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 47. In the Śatarudriya litany of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 17) xvi. 20, 21. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 4, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 13; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 4. Rudra is called lord of assailers (ā-vyādhin), thieves (stena), robbers (taskara), pickpockets (stāyu), stealers (muṣṇant), and cutters (vi-kṛnta); and designations of sharpers (gṛtsa) and bands (gaṇa, vrāta), apparently of robbers, are mentioned. 18) xvi. 25. It is therefore not surprising that the Rigveda 19) i. 129, 9; ii. 23, 16; vi. 24, 10; 41, 5; 51, 15; x. 63, 16. should contain many prayers for safety at home or on the way, or that the Atharvaveda should devote several hymns to night 20) Av. xix. 47-50. chiefly for protection against the evil doings of thieves and robbers. Pischel 21) Vedische Studien, 2, 55, 56. Contrast 1, 106. suggests that in one passage of the Rigveda 22) Rv. vii. 55. Vasiṣṭha is represented as a burglar, but the admits that, since Vasiṣṭha was attacking the house of his father Varuṇa, he was only seeking to obtain what he may have regarded as his own. But the interpretation of the hymn is not certain. 23) Cf. Aufrecht, Indische Studien, 4, 337 et seq.; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 370; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 308; Bṛhaddevatā, vii. 11 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. Sāyaṇa's explanation of one passage of the Rigveda, 24) vi. 54, 1. as referring to professional cattle-trackers, like the Khojis of the Panjab, seems quite probable. 25) Zimmer, op. cit., 182, 183, citing Elliot, Memoirs, 1, 276; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 123. The punishment of thieves appears primarily to have been left to the action of the robbed. The practice of binding them in stocks 26) Cf. Rv. i. 24, 13, 15; vii. 86, 5; Av. vi. 63, 3 = 84, 4; 115, 2. 3; 121; xix. 47, 9; 50, 1, all of which passages are cited by Zimmer, 181, 182, to prove this practice. But it must be noted that Rv. vii. 86, 5, alone is not at all conclusive evidence, though Av. xix. 47, 9; 50, 1 (drupade āhan), probably mean the same thing. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 976, 983, renders the passages as referring to casting a thief into a snare, and Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 106, makes Rv. vii. 86, 5, refer to the cattle-thief (paśu-tṛp) taking away the rope from the calf he means to steal. For Rv. x. 4, 6, see above, n. 10. The German and Slavonic parallels cited by Zimmer, 182, n., support his view. See also for a similar punishment in case of debt, Ṛṇa. seems clearly referred to. But later, at any rate-and in all probability earlier also, as in othe countries--a more severe penalty could be exacted, and death inflicted by the king. 27) Gautama Dharma Sūtra, xii. 4345; Āpastamba Dharma Sūtra, i. 9, 25, 4. 5; Jolly, op. cit., 124. There is no hint in Vedic literature of the mode of conviction; a fire ordeal is not known to the Atharvaveda, 28) Av. ii. 12 was so interpreted by Schlagintweit, Die Gottesurtheile der Inder, 9 et seq. (1866); Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 164 et seq.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 445; Zimmer, 183 et seq.; but see Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 11, 330 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 294-296; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 54; Grill, Hundert Lieder,^2 47, 85; Jolly, op cit., 146. and the ordeal known to the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 29) vi. 16; Jolly, loc. cit. is not said to be used in the case of theft. No doubt the stolen property was recovered by the person robbed if he could obtain it. Nothing is known as to what happened if the property had passed from the actual thief into the possession of another person.

tastuva|तस्तुव
तस्तुव,<BR> or Tasruva, as the Paippalāda recension has it, is the name of a remedy against snake poison, and is mentioned along with Tābuva in the Atharvaveda. 1) v. 13, 10, 11. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 428; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 244. 

taajadbhanga|ताजद्भङ्ग
ताजद्-भङ्ग<BR> (‘easily broken’) is apparently the name of a tree or plant in the Atharvaveda. 1) viii. 8, 3 (a battle hymn). The Kauśika Sūtra 2) xvi 14. Cf. Bloomfield's edition, xliv; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 583, 584; Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, 35; Lanman in Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 502; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72. treats it as a compound word, and its commentator makes it out to be the castor-oil plant (eraṇḍa). Whitney, 3) Op. cit., 504. however, treats the expression as two separate words, and thinks that the passage means ‘may they be broken suddenly (tājat) like hemp (bhañga).’

taaNDa|ताण्ड
ताण्ड<BR> seems to be the name of a sage to whose school belonged the Tāṇḍa Brāhmaṇa mentioned in the Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra. 1) vii. 10, 17. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 49.

taaNDavinda|ताण्डविन्द
ताण्ड-विन्द,<BR> or Tāṇḍa-vindava, is the name of a teacher mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka. 1) viii. 10. The manuscripts differ as to the form of the name.

taaNDi|ताण्डि
ताण्डि<BR> occurs as the name of a pupil of Bādarāyaṇa in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) at the end of the Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa. 1) See Konow's Translation, 80, n. 2.

taaNDya|ताण्ड्य
ताण्ड्य<BR> is the name of a teacher in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) vi. 1, 2, 25. Cf. Lévi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 140. quoted on a point bearing on the Agniciti, or piling of the sacred fire. He is also mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 2) Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 373, 384. The Tāṇḍya Mahābrāhmaṇa or Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 3) Edited in the Bibliotheca Indica Series, 1869-74. See Weber, Indian Literature, 66 et seq., 74, 133; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 203, 210; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 23 et seq. of the Sāmaveda represents the school of the Tāṇḍins. 

taata|तात
तात,<BR> apparently ‘dada's boy,’ an affectionate term of address by a father (cf. Tata) to a son, is found in the Brāhmaṇas, 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 14, 4; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 6; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 4, 2. occurring in the vocative only. But in the sense of ‘father,’ through confusion with Tata, it occurs also as early as the Aitareya Āraṇyaka. 2) i. 3, 3, where Tata and Tāta are given as variant forms of the address of the child to the father. Little, Grammatical Index, 75, takes Tāta to mean ‘father’ primarily, but this seems unlikely. Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 449, 454.

taadurii|तादुरी
तादुरी<BR> is mentioned in a verse of the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 15, 14. together with the female frog (Maṇḍūkī). Some similar animal must be meant, 2) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 175. but Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., where he suggests tāḍurī, from the root taḍ, ‘beat,’ with the sense of ‘splashing.’ with the commentator Durga on the Nirukta, 4) ix. 7. regards the word as an adjective describing the frog.

taanva|तान्व
1. Tānva in an obscure passage of the Rigveda 1) iii. 31, 2. seems to mean a ‘legitimate son,’ who is said not to leave the heritage (riktha) of his father to his sister (jāmi). The exact meaning is probably unascertainable, 2) Cf. Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 348; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda Noten, 1, 240; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 34. but the passage may convey a statement of what was no doubt the fact, that the daughter had no share in the paternal inheritance; her brother had to provide for her during her life if she remained unmarried, but she had no independent portion. 3) Cf. Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 87, for the modern law of the Panjab. (See Dāya.)

taanva|तान्व
2. Tānva appears to be a patronymic, ‘descendant of Tanva,’ in a verse of the Rigveda. 1) x. 93, 15. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166. thinks that it is the patronymic of Duḥśīma, who is mentioned in the preceding verse, but this is uncertain. 

taapasa|तापस
1. Tāpasa, ‘ascetic,’ is not found in Vedic literature till the Upaniṣads. 1) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 3, 22. Cf. Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 40.

taapasa|तापस
2. Tāpasa is a name of Datta who was Hotṛ priest at the snake festival described in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xxv. 15).

taabuva|ताबुव
ताबुव<BR> is the name in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 13, 10. of a remedy against snake poison. The Paippalāda recension has Tāvuca instead. Weber 2) Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1896, 681. thinks that the original form was Tāthuva, from the root sthā, ‘stand,’ and that it meant ‘stopping’; but this is hardly probable. 3) Barth. Revne del'Histoire des Religions, 39, 26. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 244; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 428.

taayaadara|तायादर
तायादर,<BR> ‘belonging to the Tayādara’ (Av. vi. 72, 2).

taayu|तायु
तायु,<BR> ‘thief,’ is mentioned several times in the Rigveda. 1) i. 50, 2; 65, 1; iv. 38, 5; v. 15, 5; 52, 12; vi. 12, 5; vii. 86, 5 (paśu-tṛṭ, ‘cattle-thief,’ see Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 106). See Taskara.

taarakaa|तारका
तारका<BR> is found several times in the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 8, 1; iii. 7, 4; vi. 121, 3; xix. 49, 8. denoting a star. The masculine form Tāraka occurs in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 2) i. 5, 2, 5.

taaruxya|तारुक्ष्य
तारुक्ष्य<BR> is the name of a teacher in the Aitareya 1) iii. 1, 6. and Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyakas. 2) vii. 19. In the former passage Tārkṣya is a variant reading, and in the latter Tārkṣya is read, but this is probably only due to confusion with Tārkṣya, the reputed author of a Rigvedic hymn. 3) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, i. 5, 2, with Keith's note; Sāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra xi. 14, 28; xii. 11, 12, Āśvalāyana Srauta Sūtra, ix. 1. 

taarxya|तार्क्ष्य
तार्क्ष्य<BR> is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 89, 6; x. 178. as a divine steed, apparently the sun conceived as a horse. 2) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 149. But Foy, 3) Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 11, 366, 367. judging by the name, apparently a patronymic of Tṛkṣi, who is known from the Rigveda 4) viii. 22, 7. onwards as a descendant of Trasadasyu, thinks that a real steed, the property of Tṛkṣi, is meant; but this is not very probable. 5) In Khila, ii. 4, 1, Tārkṣya is represented as a bird (vāyasa), also a symbol of the sun. In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xv. 18, he is mentioned with Ariṣṭanemi, originally an epithet of his (Rv. i. 89, 6; x. 178, 1), as a person, and in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 3, 13, he appears as Vaipaśyata (Vaipaścita in Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 7), king of the birds (cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 369). See also Tārukṣya.

taarpya|तार्प्य
तार्प्य<BR> denotes, in the Atharvaveda 1) xviii. 4, 31. and later, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 11, 6; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 7, 1; 7, 6, 4; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxi. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 5, 20; Kātyāyana Śranta Sūtra, xv. 5, 7 et seq.; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 12, 19. a garment made of some material, the nature of which is uncertain. The commentators on the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3) v. 3, 5, 20. Cf. Kātyāyana, loc. cit.; Sāyaṇa on Av., loc. cit.; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 879. suggest that a linen garment, or one thrice soaked in ghee, or one made of the tṛpā or of the triparṇa plant, is meant: it is doubtful whether the sense was known even to the author of the Brāhmaṇa himself. Goldstücker's 4) Dictionary, s.v. abhiṣecanīya. rendering of the word is ‘silken garment,’ which Eggeling 5) Sacred Books of the East, 41, 85, n. 1. is inclined to accept.^6

taarShTaagha|तार्ष्टाघ
तार्ष्टाघ,<BR> a species of tree, is mentioned in the Kauśika Sūtra, 1) xxv. 23. while the adjective formed from it, tārṣṭāghī, ‘derived from the Tārṣṭāgha tree,’ is found in the Atharvaveda. 2) v. 29, 15. Cf. Whitney's note in his Translation of the Atharvaveda. Weber 3) Indische Studien, 18, 280. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62. thinks that the sarṣapa, or mustard plant, is meant. 

titau|तितउ
तितौ७<BR> 1) On the peculiar form of this word, of. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 20, 3. is found once in the Rigveda 2) x. 71, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238. denoting a ‘sieve,’ or perhaps ‘winnowing fan,’ which was used for purifying corn (saktu).

tittira|तित्तिर
तित्तिर, तित्तिरि,<BR> is the name of the partridge in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 1, 2; v. 5, 16, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 10; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 30, 36. The form Tittira occurs in the Maitrāyaṇī Samhitā, iii. 14, 1. and the Brāhmaṇas, 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 5; v. 5, 4, 6; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 154, 6 (Oertel, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 181). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 91; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 251. being presumably an onomatopoetic formation. The bird is described as having variegated plumage (bahu-rūpa). It is usually associated with the Kapiñjala and Kalaviṅka.

tithi|तिथि
तिथि,<BR> as the name of a lunar day, the thirtieth part of a lunar month of rather over twenty-seven days, is only found in the later Sūtras, 1) Gobhila Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 1, 13; ii. 8, 12, 20; Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 25; v. 2, etc. being completely unknown to the Brāhmaṇas, in which the only day is the natural one. 2) Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 7, 8. See Māsa.

timirghadaureshruta|तिमिर्घदौरेश्रुत
तिमिर्घ दौरे-श्रुत<BR> (‘descendant of Dūreśruta’) is mentioned as Agnīdh (‘fire-kindling’) priest at the snake sacrifice described in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 15. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

tirashcha|तिरश्च
तिरश्च<BR> is read in some manuscripts of the Atharvaveda 1) xv. 3, 5. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 776; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Araṇyaka, 19, n. 3. in the description of the Vrātya's throne (Āsandī), meaning ‘the cross-pieces.’ But the reading should be tiraścye, which is adjectival, and is used in the same sense. 

tirashcharaaji|तिरश्चराजि
तिरश्च-राजि,<BR> 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 10, 2; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94, 95, reports this form from the Av., but the text and Roth (St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.) read tiraści-rāji there. Tiraści-rāji, 2) Av. iii. 27, 2; vi. 56, 2; vii. 56, 1; x. 4, 13; xii. 3, 56. Tiraścīna-rāji, 3) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 13, 21; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 27. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 488, 553; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 68, n. 2; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 295-297. are variant forms of a name for ‘snake’ (lit., ‘striped across’), found in the later Saṃhitās.

tirashchii|तिरश्ची
तिरश्ची<BR> is, according to the Anukramaṇī, the author of a Rigvedic hymn 1) viii. 95, 4. in which he appeals to Indra to hear his call. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 2) xii. 6, 12. adopts this view of the name, and mentions a Tiraścī Āṅgirasa. But Roth 3) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 115. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 187; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 90; Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 273. thinks that the word is not a proper name at all.

tirashchiinavaMsha|तिरश्चीनवंश
तिरश्चीन-वंश,<BR> ‘cross-beam,’ is used to denote a ‘beehive’ in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 1) iii. 1, 1. Cf. Little, Grammatical Index, 75. See also Vaṃśa.

tirindira|तिरिन्दिर
तिरिन्दिर<BR> is mentioned in a Dānastuti, or ‘Praise of Gifts,’ in the Rigveda 1) viii. 6, 46-48. as having, along with Parśu, bestowed gifts on the singer. In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 2) xvi. 11. 20. this statement is represented by a tale that the Kaṇva Vatsa obtained a gift from Tirindira Pāraśavya, Tirindira and Parśu being in this version thus treated as one and the same man. Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160, 161; 5, 142. sees in the Rigvedic passage a proof that the Yadus had gained a victory over Tirindira, and gave a part of the booty to the singers; but there is no proof whatever of the correctness of this interpretation, which Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 136, 137. shows to be most unlikely. Yadu princes must be meant by Tirindira and Parśu, though Weber 5) Indische Studien, 4, 356, n.; Indian Literature, 3, 4; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 37, 38. thinks that the singers were Yadus, not the princes. The latter he holds to have been Iranian (cf. , and see Parśu), and he thinks that in this there is evidence of continual close relations between India and Iran. This is perfectly possible, but the evidence for it is rather slight. 6 For the recent controversy as to Iranian names found at Boghaz-kiöi, cf. Jacobi, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 721 et seq.; Oldenberg, ibid., 1095-1100; Keith, ibid., 1100-1106; Sayce, ibid., 1106, 1107; Kennedy, ibid., 1107-1119. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 94 et seq., argues in favour of an early connexion of Iranians and Indians in Arachosia, where he places part of the action of the Rigveda. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 16, 277, holds that traces of Iranian connexion are signs of late date; Arnold, ibid., 18, 205 et seq., opposes this view.

tiriiTa|तिरीट
तिरीट<BR> 1) Meaning, according to later native lexicographers, ‘head-dress’ or ‘diadem.’ is found in the Atharvaveda 2) viii. 6, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 265; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 495. in the adjectival derivative tirīṭin used of a demon, and presumably meaning ‘adorned with a tiara.’

tirya|तिर्य
तिर्य<BR> occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 7, 3. as an epithet of Karambha, ‘gruel.’ It is probably equivalent to tilya, ‘made of sesamum,’ as rendered by Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Whitney, 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 155. but tiriya is read by Roth 4) See Whitney, loc. cit., with Lanman's additional note. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 377, construes the adjective with viṣam, and renders ‘the poison which comes in a horizontal direction’ (cf. tiryañc). Grill, Hundert Lieder,^2 121, amends to atiriya, ‘overflowing.’ Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 270; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 201. in the Rāja-nighaṇṭu as a kind of rice.

tiryancaangirasa|तिर्यञ्चाङ्गिरस
तिर्यञ्च् आङ्गिरस<BR> is mentioned as a seer of Sāmans, or Chants, in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xii. 6, 12. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160. The name is doubtless feigned. 

tila|तिल
तिल<BR> denotes in the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 8, 3; vi. 140, 2; xviii. 3, 69; 4, 32. and later 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 2, 10, 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 12; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ix. 1, 1, 3, etc. the sesamum plant, and particularly its grains, from which a rich oil (Taila) was extracted. It is often 3) Av. vi. 140, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit.; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 3, 22; Chāndogva Upaniṣad, v. 10, 6, etc. mentioned in connexion with Māṣa, ‘kidney bean.’ The Taittirīya Saṃhitā 4) Loc. cit. attributes the bean and the sesamum to the winter (hemanta) and the cool (śiśira) seasons. The stalk of the sesamum plant (tila-piñjī, 5) Av. ii. 8, 3. til-piñja 6) Av. xii. 2, 54.) was used for fuel, and the seed was boiled in the form of porridge (tilaudana 7) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 16; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 8. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 240.) for food.

tilvaka|तिल्वक
तिल्वक<BR> is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 8, 1, 16. as a tree (Symplocos racemosa), near which it is inauspicious to construct a grave. The adjectival derivative tailvaka, ‘made of the wood of the Tilvaka,’ is found in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 2) iii. 1, 9. and is employed to describe the yūpa, or sacrificial post, in the Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 3) iii. 8.

tiShya|तिष्य
तिष्य<BR> occurs twice in the Rigveda, 1) v. 54, 13; x. 64, 8 (with Kṛśānu as in archer). apparently as the name of a star, 2) Weber, Naxatra, 2, 290; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 355; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 331; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 77, n. 1. though Sāyaṇa takes it to mean the sun. It is doubtless identical with the Avestan Tistrya. Later it is the name of a lunar mansion: see Nakṣatra.

tisRdhanva|तिसृधन्व
तिसृ-धन्व,<BR> ‘a bow with three (arrows),’ is mentioned as a gift to the priest at the sacrifice in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) i. 8, 19, 1. and in the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 3, 4; ii. 7, 9, 2; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 1, 5, 10; xiv. 1, 1, 7. 

tugra|तुग्र
तुग्र<BR> appears in the Rigveda 1) i. 116, 3; 117, 14; vi. 62, 6. as the name of the father of Bhujyu, a protégé of the Aśvins, who is accordingly called Tugrya 2) Rv. viii. 3, 23; 74, 14. or Taugrya. 3) Rv. i. 117, 15; 118, 6; 182, 5. 6; viii. 5, 22; x. 39, 4. A different Tugra seems to be referred to in other passages of the Rigveda 4) vi. 20, 8; 26, 4; x. 49, 4. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 55, 328, 329; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 157. as an enemy of Indra.

tugrya|तुग्र्य
तुग्र्य<BR> occurs in the Rigveda as a patronymic of Bhujyu, 1) Who is also called Tugrasya sūnu, Rv. vi. 62, 6. Cf. the use of Pajriya and perhaps Kṛṣṇiya in the patronymic sense without Vṛddhi. but also in a passage 2) viii. 32, 20. in which no reference to Bhujyu appears to be meant, and in which it may mean ‘a man of the house of Tugra.’ A similar sense seems to occur in the locative plural feminine in the Rigveda, 3) i. 33, 15. Cf. Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 47. where (supplying vikṣu) the meaning must be ‘among the Tugrians.’ This explanation may also apply to the epithet of Indra 4) viii. 45, 29; 99, 7. or Soma, 5) viii. 1, 15, where, however, Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., suggests an alteration to make it refer to Indra. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 128. tugryā-vṛdh, ‘rejoicing among the Tugrians.’

tuch|तुच्
तुच्<BR> in the Rigveda 1) viii. 18, 18; 27, 14; vi. 48, 9. occasionally occurs denoting ‘children.’ Tuj occurs rather more often in the same sense. 2) iii. 45, 4; iv. 1, 3; v. 41, 9; viii. 4, 15. Cf. Tanaya and Toka.

tuji|तुजि
तुजि<BR> is the name in the Rigveda 1) vi. 26, 4; x. 49, 4. of a protégé of Indra, who in another hymn 2) vi. 20, 8. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 156; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 55, 328. appears to be called Tūtuji.

tuminjaaupoditi|तुमिञ्जऔपोदिति
तुमिञ्ज औपोदिति<BR> is mentioned in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (i. 7, 2, 1) as a Hotṛ priest at a Sattra, or ‘sacrificial session,’ and as having been engaged in a discussion with Suśravas. 

turakaavaSheya|तुरकावषेय
तुर कावषेय<BR> is mentioned in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) at the end of the tenth book of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) x. 6, 5, 9. as the source of the doctrine set forth in that book, and as separated, in the succession of teachers, from Śāṇḍilya by Yajñavacas and Kuśri. In the same Brāhmaṇa 2) ix. 5, 2, 15. he is quoted by Śāṇḍilya as having erected a fire-altar on the Kārotī. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 3) iv. 27; vii. 34; viii. 21. he appears as a Purohita, or ‘domestic priest,’ of Janamejaya Pārikṣita, whom he consecrated king. In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4) vi. 5, 4 (Kāṇva, not in Mādhyaṃdina). and a Khila 5) i. 9, 6; Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 65, 190. he appears as an ancient sage. Oldenberg, 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 239. no doubt rightly, assigns him to the end of the Vedic period. He is probably 7) So the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. identical with Tura, the deva-muni, ‘saint of the gods,’ who is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 8) xxv. 14, 5. See Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 68. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 203, n.; Indian Literature, 120, 131; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, xviii.

turashravas|तुरश्रवस्
तुर-श्रवस्<BR> is the name of a seer mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) ix. 4, 10. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 53; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 316. as having pleased Indra by two Sāmans (Chants) of his composition. Indra in return appears to have given him the oblation of the Pārāvatas on the Yamunā.

turyavaah|तुर्यवाह्
तुर्य-वाह्,<BR> masc.; Turyauhī, fem., ‘a four-year-old ox or cow,’ is mentioned in the later Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 3, 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 11; 13, 17; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 10; xviii. 26, etc.

turva|तुर्व
तुर्व<BR> occurs only once in the Rigveda (x. 62, 10), doubtless as a name of the Turvaśa people or king. 

turvasha|तुर्वश
तुर्वश<BR> occurs frequently in the Rigveda as the name of a man or of a people, usually in connexion with Yadu. The two words usually occur in the singular without any connecting particle, Turvaśa Yadu or Yadu Turvaśa. 2) v. 31, 8. In a plural form the name Turvaśa occurs once with the Yadus, 3) i. 108, 8. and once alone 4) viii. 4, 18; singular with Ānava in viii. 4, 1. in a hymn in which the singular has already been used. In one passage 5) iv. 30, 17. the dual Turvaśā-Yadū actually occurs, and in another 6) x. 62, 10. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 220, n. 1. Yadus Turvaś ca, ‘Yadu and Turva.’ In other passages 7) i. 4, 77; vi. 27, 7. Cf. viii. 4, 1. Turvaśa appears alone, while in one 8) vii. 19, 8. Turvaśa and Yādva occur. From these facts Hopkins 9) Op. cit., 258 et seq. deduces the erroneousness of the ordinary view, 10) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 122, 124; Oldenberg, Buddha, 404; Ludwig, op. cit., 153; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 64; Sanskrit Literature, 153 et seq., etc. according to which Turvaśa is the name of a tribe, the singular denoting the king, and regards Turvaśa as the name of the Yadu king. But the evidence for this is not conclusive. Without laying any stress on the argument based on the theory 11) Zimmer, 122, 124; Macdonell, 153, 154. that the ‘five peoples’ of the Rigveda are the Anus, Druhyus, Turvaśas, Yadus, and Pūrus, it is perfectly reasonable to hold that the Turvaśas and Yadus were two distinct though closely allied tribes. Such they evidently were to the seers of the hymns which mention in the dual the Turvaśā-Yadū and speak of Yadus Turvaś ca. This explanation also suits best the use of the plural of Turvaśa in two Rigvedic hymns. In the Rigveda the chief exploit of Turvaśa was his participation in the war against Sudās, by whom he was defeated. 12) vii. 18, 6. Hopkins 13) Op. cit., 264. suggests that he may have been named Turvaśa because of his fleet (tura) escape from the battle. His escape 1 i. 36, 18; 54, 6; 174, 9; vi. 20, 12; 45, 1; viii. 4, 7; 7, 18; 9, 14; 45, 27; x. 49, 8. In vii. 18, 6, Turvaśa is joined with Yakṣu, apparently a contemptuous variant of Yadu (Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 261). Cf. Tṛtsu. may have been assisted by Indra, for in some passages 14) Rv. i. 174, 9; iv. 30, 17; v. 31, 8; viii. 4, 7. Indra's aid to Turvaśa (and) Yadu is referred to; it is also significant that the Anu, and apparently the Druhyu, kings are mentioned as having been drowned in the defeat, but not the Turvaśa and Yadu kings, and that Turvaśa appears in the eighth book of the Rigveda as a worshipper of Indra with the Anu prince, the successor, presumably, of the one who was drowned. 15) Hopkins, 265. Griffith, 16) Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 433, n. however, proposes to refer these passages to a defeat by Turvaśa and Yadu of Arṇa and Citraratha on the Sarayu; 17) The hymn is a late one, and the connexion of verse 18, where Arṇa and Citraratha are mentioned, is obscure. Cf. Hopkins. 259. but the evidence for this is quite inadequate. Two passages of the Rigveda 18) vi. 45, 1; ix. 61, 2 (where Divodāsa is mentioned); vii. 19, 8 (where he appears as Atithigva). seem to refer to an attack by Turvaśa and Yadu on Divodāsa, the father of Sudās. It is reasonable to suppose that this was an attack of the two peoples on Divodāsa, for there is some improbability of the references being to the Turvaśa, who was concerned in the attack on Sudās, the son. Zimmer 19) Op. cit., 124. considers that the Turvaśas were also called Vṛcīvants. This view is based on a hymn 20) vi. 27, 5-7. in which reference is made to the defeat of the Vṛcīvants on the Yavyāvatī and Hariyūpīyā in aid of Daivarāta, and of Turvaśa in aid of Sṛñjaya, the latter being elsewhere 21) iv. 15, 4. clearly the son of Devarāta. But as this evidence for the identification of the Turvaśas with the Vṛcīvants is not clear, it seems sufficient 22) Oldenberg, Buddha, 404, n. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105. to assume that they were allies. Later, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 23) xiii. 5, 4, 16. the Turvaśas appear as allies of the Pañcālas, Taurvaśa horses, thirty-three in number, and armed men, to the number of 6,000, being mentioned. 24) The sense is obscure. The St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it apparently as 6,033 horses (of armed warriors); Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 400, prefers to understand it as 33 horses and 6,000 men; Oldenberg, loc. cit., takes it as 6,033 warriors. Harisvāmin's Commentary, cited by Eggeling, is obscure. But otherwise the name disappears: this lends probability to Oldenberge's conjecture 25) Buddha, 404. that the Turvaśas became merged in the Pañcāla people. Hopkins 26) Op. cit., 258, n. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 220. considers that in the Śatapatha passage the horses were merely named from the family of Turvaśa; but this view is less likely, since it ignores the difficulty involved in the reference to the men. It is impossible to be certain regarding the home of the Turvaśas at the time of their conflict with Sudās. They apparently crossed the Paruṣṇī, 27) Rv. vii. 18. but from which side is disputed. The view of Pischel 28) Vedische Studien, 2, 218, Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 126. and Geldner, 29) Vedische Studien, 3, 152. If in Rv. viii. 20, 24, 1 rvaśa is read with Ludwig for tūrvath hey are connected with the Sindhu. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 167; Muir, Sanskrit Text, 5, 286; Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 2, 354 et seq. that they advanced from the west towards the east, where the Bharatas were (see Kuru), is the more probable.

turviiti|तुर्वीति
तुर्वीति<BR> is mentioned several times in the Rigveda, both in association with Vayya 1) i. 54, 6; ii. 13, 12; iv. 19, 6. and alone. 2) Rv. i. 36, 18; 61, 11; 112, 23. In three passages 3) i. 61, 11; ii. 13, 12; iv. 19, 6. reference is made to Indra aiding him over a flood. Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 147; 4, 254. Cf. Turvas1a, and Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 2, 358; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 42, 36. has conjectured that he was king of the Turvaśas and Yadus. But there is no sufficient evidence for this view, though presumably he was of the Turvaśa tribe.

tulaa|तुला
तुला,<BR> ‘scales,’ is mentioned in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 1) xxx. 17. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) xi. 2, 7, 33. also speaks of the balance in connexion with the weighing of a man's good and evil deeds in the next and in this world. This differs very considerably from the later balance 3) Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 145. ordeal, in which a man was weighed twice, and was pronounced guilty or innocent according as, on the second occasion, he was more or less heavy than on the first. It is not possible to read the later practice into the earlier. 4) Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 21; 2, 363, quotes Schlagintweit as giving this passage as an example of the balance ordeal. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 45, n. 4.

tuSha|तुष
तुष,<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 6, 16; xi. 1, 12, 29; 3, 5; xii. 3, 19. and later, 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 5, 5; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 9, etc. regularly denotes the ‘husk’ of grain, often used for a fire. 3) Tuṣa-pakva, Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 4, 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 2, 1, 7.

tuuNava|तूणव
तूणव<BR> denotes in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Samhitā, vi. 1, 4, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 6, 8; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiii. 4; xxxiv. 5 (Indische Studien, 3, 477). and the Brāhmaṇas 2) Pañcavimśa Brāhmaṇa, vi. 5, 13; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 13, 1; 15, 1; Nirukta, xiii. 9. a musical instrument of wood, probably the ‘flute.’ A ‘fluteblower’ is enumerated among the victims of the Puruṣamedha, or ‘human sacrifice.’ 3) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 19, 20; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 289.

tuutuji|तूतुजि
तूतुजि<BR> See Tuji.

tuupara|तूपर
तूपर,<BR> ‘hornless,’ is a frequent description of animals intended for the sacrifice, especially of the goat, in the Atharvaveda and later. 1) Av. xi. 9, 22; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 1, 4, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 1, 15; xxix. 59, etc.; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 3, 7, etc.

tuurghna|तूर्घ्न
तूर्घ्न<BR> is mentioned in the Taittirīya Āraṇyak (v. 1) as the northern part of Kurukṣetra. 1) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 78. Its exact position, however, cannot be ascertained.

tuurNaasha|तूर्णाश
तूर्णाश,<BR> in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 32, 4. Cf. Nirukta, v. 16. seems to denote a ‘mountain torrent.’ 

tuurvayaaNa|तूर्वयाण
तूर्वयाण<BR> is the name of a prince mentioned in the Rigveda. He appears by name in two passages, 1) i. 53, 10; vi. 18, 13. and is clearly alluded to in a third, 2) ii. 14, 7 (as a comparison of the two preceding passages shows); perhaps also viii. 53, 2. In i. 174, 3, Tūrvayāṇa seems also to be a proper name, though Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., here regards the word as an adjective. as an enemy of Atithigva, Āyu, and Kutsa. With this accords the fact that the Pakthas were opposed in the battle of the ten kings to the Tṛtsus, 3) vii. 18. and that Tūrvayāṇa  is shown by another passage of the Rigveda 4) x. 61, 1 et seq.; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 71-77. to have been a prince of the Pakthas. He is there represented as having been a protégé of Indra, who aided him against Cyavāna and his guardians, the Maruts. It is not probable that he is identical with Suśravas. 5) Mentioned in i. 53, 9. 10. Cf. Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 75, n.

tuuSha|तूष
तूष<BR> is found in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 1, 1; ii. 4, 9, 1; vi. 1, 1, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiii. 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 1, 8; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 1, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 262. denoting the ‘fringe’ or ‘trimming’ of a garment.

tRxi|तृक्षि
तृक्षि<BR> is, in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 22, 7. the name of a prince who was a Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu.’ He also appears with the Druhyu and the Pūru peoples in another hymn. 2) vi. 46, 8. It is not certain that the two persons are identical (cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologic, 1, 113, notes 3, 4), but it is probable. It has been conjectured, but it is not probable, that the steed Tārkṣya (as ‘belonging to Tṛkṣi’) was his. 3) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 149.

tRNa|तृण
तृण,<BR> ‘grass,’ is often mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 161, 1; 162, 8, 11; x. 102, 10, etc. and later. 2) Av. ii. 30, 1; vi. 54, 1, etc.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 22; viii. 24, etc. It was used as straw to roof in a house or hut. 3) Av. iii. 12, 5; ix. 3, 4, 7. 

tRNajalaayuka|तृणजलायुक
तृण-जलायुक,<BR> ‘caterpillar,’ is mentioned in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (iv. 2, 4).

tRNaskanda|तृणस्कन्द
तृण-स्कन्द<BR> occurs once in the Rigveda 1) i. 172, 3. as the name of a prince, his subjects (viśaḥ) being referred to. 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 159, takes viśaḥ as ‘cantons,’ but see Viś. The word may originally have meant ‘grasshopper.’ 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

tRtiiyaka|तृतीयक
तृतीयक,<BR> ‘the tertian (fever),’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda (i. 25, 4; v. 22, 13; xix. 39, 10). See Takman.

tRtsu|तृत्सु
तृत्सु<BR> occurs in the Rigveda, once in the singular 1) vii. 18, 13. and several times in the plural, 2) vii. 18, 7. 15. 19; 33, 5. 6; 83, 4. 6. 8. as a proper name. The Tṛtsus were clearly helpers of Sudās in the great battle against the ten kings, Śimyu, the Turvaśa, the Druhyu, Kavaṣa, the Pūru, the Anu, Bheda, Śambara, the two Vaikarṇas, and perhaps the Yadu, who led with them as allies 3) They were regarded as enemies of the kings by Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 95, and by Zimmer, op. cit., 126, The latter, however, altered his view (see pp. 430, 431, which Hopkins, op. cit., 260, has overlooked), and there is no doubt that the later opinion is correct. Cf. also Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173; Hopkins, 260, 261. Of these tribes the Pakthas, Alinas, Bhalānas, Viṣāṇins, and Śivas, were probably settled in the north-west, to the west of the Indus, and around the Kabul River. The Anus, Pūrus, Turvaśas, Yadus, and Druhyus, were probably tribes of the Panjab; the Ajas, Śigrus, and Yakṣus, tribes of the east, under Bheda; Śambara may also have been a native of the east; Śimyu and Kavaṣa are doubtful; and the Vaikarṇau probably belonged to the north-west. the Matsyas, Pakthas, Bhalānas, Alinas, Viṣāṇins, Śivas, Ajas, Śigrus, and perhaps Yakṣus. 4) This is uncertain; the text of the Rigveda, vii. 18, 6, has Yakṣu, and the same word recurs in verse 19. On the other hand, the word Yadu would naturally be expected in verse 6, as Turvaśa is mentioned. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 122, says that Yadu occurs in vii. 18, but on p. 126 he cites Yakṣu in both places, evidently by oversight. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 261, n., considers that Turvaśa, the Yakṣu, is a sarcastic expression, instead of Turvaśa, the Yadu, making Turvaśa, whom he regards as king of the Yadus, ridiculous as a member of an insignificant people, and alluding to him also as a sacrificial victim (as it were, yaṣṭavya, ‘to be offered’; of puroḍāś, ‘cake of sacrifice,’ in verse 6, as a pun on purogās, ‘leader’). Whether Yakṣu is used contemptuously for Yadu or not, it seems hard not to believe that the Yadus are referred to. The defeat of the ten kings is celebrated in one hymn of the Rigveda, 5) vii. 18. and is evidently alluded to in two others. 6) vii. 33 and 83. The great battle took place on the Paruṣṇī, but there was also a fight on the Yamunā with Bheda, the Ajas, Śigrus, and Yakṣus. As the Yamunā and the Parusṇī represent opposite ends of the territory of the Tṛtsus (for we cannot with Hopkins 7) India, Old and New, 52. No such conjecture was made by him in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 259 et seq. safely identify the streams), it is difficult to see exactly how the ten kings could be confederated, but it should be noted that the references to the ten kings occur in the two later hymns, 6) vii. 33 and 83. and not in the hymn 5) vii. 18. describing the battle itself; besides, absolute numerical accuracy cannot be insisted upon. It is difficult exactly to determine the character of the Tṛtsus; especially in their relation to the Bharatas, who under Viśvāmitra's guidance are represented as prospering and as advancing to the Vipāś and Śutudrī. 8) Rv. iii. 33; 53, 9-12. Roth ingeniously brought this into connexion with the defeat of his enemies by Sudās, which is celebrated in the seventh book of the Rigveda--a book attributed to the Vasiṣṭha family--and thought that there was a reference in one verse 9) vii. 33, 6. See Roth, op. cit., 90, 121: Muir. Sanskrit Texts, 12, 320; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 154, 155; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur and Cultur, 35, 36; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 110, 111; Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society. 16, 41. to the defeat of the Bharatas by Sudās. But it seems certain that the verse is mistranslated, and that the Bharatas are really represented as victors with Sudās. 10) Oldenberg, Buddha, 406: Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 34. Ludwig 11) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 175. accordingly identifies the Tṛtsus and the Bharatas. Oldenberg, 12) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 207. Cf. Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 2, 362. after accepting this view at first, 13) Buddha, 405, 406. later expressed the opinion that the Tṛtsus were the priests of the Bharata people, and therefore identical with the Vasiṣṭhas. This view is supported by the fact that in one passage 14) Rv. vii. 33, 1 (śvityañco dakṣiṇataskaparainaḥ). the Tṛtsus are clearly described as wearing their hair in the peculiar manner affected by the Vasiṣṭhas, 15) Rv. vii. 83. (śvityañco dakṣiṇataskaparainaḥ). and would in that passage thus seem to represent the Vasiṣṭhas. But Geldner 16) Vedische Studien, 2, 136; ṚgvedaGlossar, 74. has suggested with great probability that Tṛtsu, who is once mentioned in the singular, 17) Rv. vii. 18, 13. means the Tṛtsu king--that is, Sudās. 18) Cf. Rv. vii. 18, 24. The parallelism of verses 13 and 24 is quite beyond question. Moreover, the praise of Sudās and of the Bharatas is found coupled in Rv. iii. 53, 9. 12. 24, and in Rv. vi. 16, 4, 5, Divodāsa is coupled with the Bharatas in such a way as to suggest irresistibly that Divodāsa was a Bharata. This explanation alone justifies the description 19) Rv. vii. 33, 6. of the Bharatas as Tṛtsūnāṃ viśaḥ, 20) That this is the sense of viśaḥ is almost certain. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, loc. cit. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 159, and Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 111, render it ‘cantons,’ but see Vīś. ‘subjects of the Tṛtsus,’ meaning the Tṛtsu Gotra or family, for the people could not be said to be subjects of a body of priests. The Vasiṣṭhas might be called Tṛtsus because of their close connexion with the royal house of that people. The reverse process is also quite possible, but is rendered improbable by the fact that the Pratṛdaḥ are referred to as receiving Vasiṣṭha. 21) Rv. vii. 33, 14. Geldner (op. cit., 138, 139) ingeniously suggests that Vasiṣṭha, being miraculously born, needed a Gotra, and so became a Tṛtsu. This name of the Tṛtsu dynasty is probably older than its connexion with Vasiṣṭha in the time of Sudās, a conclusion supported by the name of Pratardana, who is mentioned later as a descendant of Divodāsa, 22) Pratardana is mentioned in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxvi. 5, as Daivodāsi, ‘descendant of Divodāsa.’ an ancestor of Sudās. The Tṛtsu dynasty could therefore hardly have been referred to as Vasiṣṭhas. For the further history of the dynasty and its relation with Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, see Sudās. If the Tṛtsus and their subjects, the Bharatas, were in the Rigvedic period at war with the tribes on either side of the territory between the Paruṣṇī and the Yamunā, it is clear 23) Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 406 et seq., and see Kuru. that later on they coalesced with the Pūrus and probably others of those tribes to form the Kuru people. Already in the Rigveda 24) See Rv. vi. 47, where Divodāsa and Sārñjaya are both praised. In vi. 27, 5, the Turvaśas are opposed to the Sṛñjayas, and in vii. 18, 6; 19, 8, the Tṛtsus are opposed to the Turvaśas. the Tṛtsus are allied with the Sṛñjayas, and in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 25) ii. 4, 4, 5. one Purohita serves both Kurus and Sṛñjayas. Hillebrandt 26) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 98 et seq. considers that the Tṛtsus cannot be identified with the Bharatas, but that Sudās and the Bharatas represent an invading body, which, however, became allied with the Tṛtsus and the Vasiṣṭha priests. He also thinks that the Rigveda reveals a time when Divodāsa, the grandfather or ancestor of Sudās, was living in Arachosia, on the Sarasvatī, and warring against the Paṇis, whom he identifies with the Parnians. But this conjecture 27) Cf. also Grierson, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 837 et seq. cannot be regarded as probable. In the Sarasvatī 28) Rv. vi. 61, 3. Brunnhofer, Iran und Turan, 127, identifies this river with the Oxus, but Hillebrandt identifies it with the Haraqaiti. it is not necessary to see any other river than the later Sarasvatī, in the middle country, which flowed within the boundaries of the Tṛtsus: it is also significant that there are references 29) Rv. ix. 61, 2. Cf. vi. 45, 1; Zimmer, op. cit., 124. Cf. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 424. to contests between Turvaśa Yadu and Atithigva or Divodāsa. Thus there is no reason to doubt that Divodāsa and the Bharatas were in the middle country, and not in Iran.

tRShTa|तृष्ट
तृष्ट<BR> is mentioned in the Maitrāyaṇī 1) iv. 8, 1. The reading is uncertain; it may be Tṛṣṭhā-varutrī. See von Schroeder's edition, p. 106, n. and Kāṭhaka Saṃhitās 2) xxx. 1, where again the reading is uncertain. The Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā, xlvi. 4, has Tvaṣṭā-varutrī (von Schroeder's edition of the Kāṭhaka, 2, 181, n.). Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 190, 191; Lévi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 119. as being along with Varutri the priest of the Asuras.

tRShTaamaa|तृष्टामा
तृष्टामा<BR> is mentioned as a stream in the Nadī-stuti, or ‘praise of rivers,’ in the Rigveda. 1) x. 75, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14. There seems to be no means of identifying it.

tejana|तेजन
तेजन<BR> denotes in the Rigveda 1) i. 110, 5. a rod or staff of reed used for measuring a field. In the Atharvaveda the sense of ‘bamboo’ is found twice, 2) i. 2, 4; xx. 136, 3 (= Khila, v. 22, 3). Cf. taijana as an adjective in Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxi. 10. the bamboo being specified in the second passage as ‘of the spring’ (vāsantika); more particularly it denotes the shaft of an arrow, 3) Av. vi. 49, 1 (Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 317); iṣu eka-tejanā, ‘an arrow with one shaft,’ vi. 57, 1. a sense often found in later Vedic texts. 4) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 25; iii. 26; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxv. 1 (with śṛṅga and śalya as the three parts of an arrow; in Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 8, 1, kulmala takes the place of tejana; cf. ibid., 2). The Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 3, 3, 1, has anīka, śalya, and tejana. Cf. Iṣu.

tejanii|तेजनी
तेजनी<BR> denotes in the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas a bundle of reeds, 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 8, 3, 12; perhaps Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiii. 9. and in some cases such a bundle twisted into a rope, 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxii. 13; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 11, as rendered by Sāyaṇa. for the two ends of the Tejanī are mentioned.

tejas|तेजस्
तेजस्<BR> is regarded by Schrader 1) Prehistoric Antiquities, 221. as having in the Rigveda 2) Cf. vi. 3, 5; 8, 5; 15, 19. the specific sense of ‘axe.’ But in all the passages the sense of the ‘bolt’ of the god is adequate.

taittiriiya|तैत्तिरीय
तैत्तिरीय<BR> is the name of one of the divisions of the Black Yajurveda, which is, however, not found thus described until the Sūtra period. 1) Anupada Sūtra, ii. 6; vii. 7. 10, etc. See Weber Indian Literature, 87 et seq.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 175 et seq.; von Schroeder, Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 1, x et seq. The school is represented by a Saṃhitā, 2) Edited by Weber, Indische Studien, xi, xii, and in the Bibliotheca Indica, 1854-1899. a Brāhmaṇa, 3) Edited in the Bibliotheca Indica, 1855-1870, and in the Ānandāśrama Series, 1898. and an Āraṇyaka, 4) Edited in the Bibliotheca Indica, 18641872, and in the Ānandāśrama Series, 1898. besides an Upaniṣad, 5) Edited by Roer, 1850, and in the Ānandāśrama Series, 1889. which forms a part of the Āraṇyaka.

taimaata|तैमात
तैमात<BR> is twice mentioned as a species of snake in the Atharvaveda. 1) v. 13, 6; 18, 4. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 243; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 425; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95. 

taila|तैल
तैल,<BR> ‘sesamum oil,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 1) i. 7, 2 (all the manuscripts have taula, which must be wrong; the Paippalāda MS has tūla: see Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 7). where 2) xx. 136, 16. reference is made to keeping such oil in jars. In the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 3) xi. 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben. 240, 241. reference is made to anointing with sesamum oil.

toka|तोक
तोक<BR> denotes ‘children’ or ‘descendants’ generally in the Rigveda 1) i. 43, 2; ii. 2, 11; 9, 2; vii. 62, 6; viii. 5, 20; 67, 11, etc. and later. 2) Av. i. 13, 2; 28, 3; v. 19, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvi. 7 (Indische Studien, 3, 466); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 5, 2, 39, etc. The word is often joined with Tanaya. 3) Rv. i. 31, 12; 64, 14; 114, 6; 147, 1; ii. 33, 14; v. 53, 13; vi. 1, 12, etc.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7.

tokman|तोक्मन्
तोक्मन्,<BR> neut., denotes in the Rigveda 1) x. 62, 8. and later 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 13, 81; xxi. 30. 42; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 11; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 9; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5, etc. the green shoots of any kind of grain. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 3) viii. 16. Cf. for its use at the Sautrāmaṇī, Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 160. reference is made to the shoots of rice (vrīhi), large rice (mahāvrīhi), panic seed (priyaṅgu), and barley (yava).

tottra|तोत्त्र
तोत्त्र,<BR> a ‘goad’ for driving cattle, is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xii. 4, 1, 10).

toda|तोद
तोद<BR> appears once to denote a ‘goad’ in the Rigveda, 1) iv. 16, 11; Mantra in Kauśika Sūtra, 107. but more often 2) Rv. vi. 6, 6; 12, 1, 3, are probably so to be understood. it is an agent noun meaning ‘impeller.’ Geldner 3) Vedische Studien, 3, 74. considers that in one passage 4) Rv. i. 150, 1. the sense is ‘wielder of the rod of punishment’ (later daṇḍa-dhara)--that is, ‘prince.’ 

taugrya|तौग्र्य
तौग्र्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Tugra,’ is the patronymic of Bhujyu in the Rigveda. 1) i. 117, 16; 118, 6; 182, 5. 6; viii. 5, 22; x. 39, 4.

taudii|तौदी
तौदी<BR> in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) x. 4, 24. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 578, leaves the word untranslated. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 608, suggests that it is a fanciful name, ‘the piercer,’ since it is associated with ghṛtācī, ‘dripping with ghee,’ which is clearly such a word. appears to denote a plant.

taurvasha|तौर्वश
तौर्वश<BR> See Turvaśa.

taula|तौल
तौल,<BR> the reading of the text of the Atharvaveda (i. 7, 2), and a form which is otherwise unknown and cannot be satisfactorily explained, must doubtless be meant for Taila.

tauvilikaa|तौविलिका
तौविलिका,<BR> occurring once in a hymn of the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 16, 3. is a word of quite uncertain sense. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. thinks it means some kind of beast; Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 72. and Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 292. regard it as a sort of plant; Sāyaṇa explains it as a disease-causing demon, while Bloomfield 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 30, 466. leaves the sense doubtful.

trapu|त्रपु
त्रपु<BR> denotes ‘tin’ in the Atharvaveda 1) xi. 3, 8. and later. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xviii. 10; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 11, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 13 (all in enumerations of metals); Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 12, 6, 5; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 17, 3; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 17, 7. In Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 7, 5, 1, the form is trapus. Its quality of being easily smelted, which Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 53. thinks is indicated by the name (as derived from the root trap, ‘be ashamed’), is clearly alluded to in the Atharvaveda passage. 

trasadasyu|त्रसदस्यु
त्रस-दस्यु,<BR> son of Purukutsa, 1) Rv. v. 33, 8; vii. 19, 3; viii. 19, 36; iv. 42, 8 et seq. is mentioned in the Rigveda as king of the Pūrus. 2) Rv. iv. 38, 1 et seq.; vii. 19, 3. He is merely alluded to in i. 63, 7; 112, 4; viii. 8, 21; 36, 7; 37, 7; 49, 10. He was born to Purukutsa by his wife, Purukutsānī, at a time of great distress; 3) Rv. iv. 42, 8 et seq. this, according to Sāyaṇa, refers to Purukutsa's captivity: possibly his death is really meant. Trasadasyu was also a descendant of Girikṣit, 4) Rv. v. 33, 8. and Purukutsa was a descendant of Durgaha. The genealogy, therefore, appears to be: Durgaha, Girikṣit, Purukutsa, Trasadasyu. Trasadasyu was the ancestor of Tṛkṣi, 5) Rv. viii. 22, 7. He was a Pūru king. See vi. 46, 8. and, according to Ludwig, 6) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155, with reference to Rv. v. 33, 7 et seq. had a son Hiraṇin. Trasadasyu's chronological position is determined by the fact that his father, Purukutsa, was a contemporary of Sudās, either as an opponent 7) So Ludwig, 3, 174, who alters Sudāsam to Sudāse, in support of this view, in Rv. i. 63, 7. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 204, 205, 219, ṚgvedaNoten, 1, 63; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 153; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 112, n. 1. Foy, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 34, 242, denies that the word in this passage is a proper name at all. or as a friend. 8) Cf. Hillebrandt, loc. cit. That Purukutsa was an enemy of Sudās is more probable, because the latter's predecessor, Divodāsa, was apparently 9) Rv. i. 130, 7; Ludwig, 3, 114; but see Hillebrandt, 1, 113, 114. at enmity with the Pūrus, and in the battle of the ten kings Pūrus were ranged against Sudās and the Tṛtsus. Trasadasyu himself seems to have been an energetic king. His people, the Pūrus, were settled on the Sarasvatī, 10) Rv. vii. 95, 96; Ludwig, 3, 175; Hillebrandt, 1, 115. which was, no doubt, the stream in the middle country, that locality according well with the later union of the Pūrus with the Kuru people, who inhabited that country. This union is exemplified in the person of Kuruśravaṇa, who is called Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ in the Rigveda, 11) x. 33, 4. Cf. Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 386 et seq.; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 150, 184. whose father was Mitrātithi, and whose son was Upamaśravas. The relation of Mitrātithi to Tṛkṣi does not appear. Another descendant of Trasadasyu was Tryaruṇa Traivṛṣṇa, who is simply called Trasadasyu in a hymn of the Rigveda. 12) v. 27. He was not only a ‘descendant of Trivṛṣan,’ but, according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 13) xiii. 3, 12. The Tāṇḍaka, cited by Sāyaṇa (Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 67), has Trasadasyu, like the Rv. he was also Traidhātva, ‘descendant of Tridhātu.’ The order of these two predecessors of Tryaruṇa cannot be determined in any way from Vedic literature. According to the later tradition, 14) Harivaṃśa, 714 et seq., where the name (716) is also misread as Tridharman. Traidhātva cannot reasonably be taken as representing a patronymic from Tridhanvan, as Sieg, op. cit., 7476, seems to do. Trivṛṣan has entirely disappeared from the Epic tradition; there is thus no way of assigning a relative priority to either Trivṛṣan or Tridhanvan. a prince named Tridhanvan preceded Tryaruṇa in the succession. Vedic tradition further fails to show in what precise relation Trasadasyu stood to Trivṛṣan or Tryaruṇa. Trasdasyu Paurukutsa appears in several Brāhmaṇas 15) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 16; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxii. 3 (Indische Studien, 3, 473); Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 5, 3. as a famous sacrificer of ancient times, together with Para Āṭṇāra, Vītahavya Śrāyasa, and Kakṣīvant Auśija, who in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 16) ii. 6, 11. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 217 et seq.; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 111-116; 2, 165, n. 4; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 25; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 386. are called ‘ancient great kings’ (pūrve mahārājāḥ).

traataaiShumata|त्रातऐषुमत
त्रात ऐषुमत<BR> (‘descendant of Iṣumant’) is mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) i. 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 372. as a pupil of Nigaḍa Pārṇavalki.

traayamaaNaa|त्रायमाणा
त्रायमाणा<BR> denotes in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 2, 6. a plant of an unknown species. The word is possibly only an epithet, retaining its participial sense of ‘preserving,’ though this interpretation is not favoured by the accent. 2) Trāyamāṇā. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 477.

traasadasyava|त्रासदस्यव
त्रासदस्यव,<BR> ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ is the patronymic in the Rigveda of Tṛkṣi 1) viii. 22, 7. and of Kuruśravaṇa. 2) x. 33, 4. The word is also applied to Agni as ‘protector of, or worshipped by, Trasadasyu’ and his line. 3) viii. 19, 32; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 96.

trikakud|त्रिककुद्
त्रि-ककुद्<BR> 1) Av. iv. 9, 8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 3, 12. or Tri-kakubh, 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 6, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiii. 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xv. 4; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxii. 14. ‘having three peaks,’ occurs in the Atharvaveda and later as the name of a mountain in the Himālaya, the modern Trikota. From it came the salve (Āñjana), 3) Hence called Traikakuda, Av. iv. 9, 9, 10; xix. 44, 6, etc. which tradition made out to be derived from Vṛtra's eye. 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit.; Maitrāyaṇī and Kāṭhaka Saṃhitās, loc. cit. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 198; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 5, 29, 30; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 239, n. 4; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 381.

trikadruka|त्रिकद्रुक
त्रि-कद्रुक,<BR> a term used in the plural only, appears to denote three vessels of some kind for holding Soma. ^1 i. 32, 3; ii. 11, 17; 15, 1; 22, 1; x. 14, 16.

trikharva|त्रिखर्व
त्रि-खर्व<BR> is the name of a school of priests mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (ii. 8, 3) as practising a special rite with success.

trita|त्रित
त्रित<BR> is clearly a god 1) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 67-69. in Vedic literature, but Yāska in one passage of the Nirukta 2) iv. 6. already explains the name as that of a Ṛṣi or seer.

tripura|त्रिपुर
त्रि-पुर,<BR> ‘a threefold stronghold,’ is alluded to in the Brāhmaṇas 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 3, 3, 25; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 11; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa in Indische Studien, 2, 310. See also Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiv. 10, etc., and Lévi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 46, n 1. as a secure protection. But as the passages are mythical no stress can be laid on them as evidence for the existence of forts with three concentric walls. 

triplaxa|त्रिप्लक्ष
त्रि-प्लक्ष,<BR> masc. plur., ‘the three fig-trees,’ is the name of the place where the Dṛṣadvatī disappeared, near the Yamunā, according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 13, 4. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 29, 33; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 19, 9; Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, xxiv. 6, 39.

triyavi|त्रियवि
त्रिय्-अवि<BR> See Tryavi.

triyuga|त्रियुग
त्रि-युग,<BR> neut., is an expression occurring in the Rigveda 1) x. 97, 1 = Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 6, 1, and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā; xii. 75. where it is said that the plants (oṣadhi) were born ‘three ages’ before the gods (devebhyas triyugaṃ purā). The commentator on the Nirukta 2) ix. 28. thinks that the ages here meant are the Yugas of the later Indian chronology, the sense of the passage being that the plants were born in the first Yuga. The author of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3) vii. 2, 4, 26. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 340. understands three seasons--spring, the rains, and autumn--to be meant in the verse, taking the two words triyugaṃ purā separately as ‘formerly, in the three seasons.’ The vague sense ‘three ages’ is quite adequate: the use of ‘three’ in such cases is a favourite feature in folklore. Cf. Yuga.

trivatsa|त्रिवत्स
त्रि-वत्स,<BR> ‘three years old,’ 1) As regards the form and meaning of this compound, cf. Tryavi. is an expression applied to cattle in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 10; xviii. 26; xxviii. 27; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 13; xviii. 9; xxi. 14, etc. Cf. Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 3, 9 et seq., where one explanation of the word is tri-varṣa.

trivRt|त्रिवृत्
त्रि-वृत्,<BR> ‘threefold,’ is the designation of an amulet in the Atharvaveda (v. 28, 2. 4).

trivedakRShNaraatalauhitya|त्रिवेदकृष्णरातलौहित्य
त्रि-वेद कृष्ण-रात लौहित्य<BR> (‘descendant of Lohita’) is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Śyāmajayanta Lauhitya, according to a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 42, 1). 

trishanku|त्रिशङ्कु
त्रि-शङ्कु<BR> is in Vedic literature the name of a sage mentioned as a teacher in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad. 1) i. 10, 1. There is no trace of the later legend by which he becomes the victim of Vasiṣṭha's curse and the object of Viśvāmitra's solicitude, being eventually fixed in the sky as a constellation. 2) See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 362, 375 et seq. The confusion of the chronology in the tales of Triśaṅku is a good example of the worthlessness of the supposed epic tradition.

trishoka|त्रिशोक
त्रि-शोक<BR> is the name of an ancient mythical seer who is mentioned both in the Rigveda 1) i. 112, 13; viii. 45, 30. In x. 29, 2, the word seems merely to be an adjective, meaning ‘with triple splendour.’ and the Atharvaveda. 2) iv. 29, 6. A Sāman, or chant, named after him is referred to in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 3) viii. 1. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 107, 162; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 33.

traikakuda|त्रैककुद
त्रै-ककुद<BR> See Trikakud.

traitana|त्रैतन
त्रैतन<BR> appears in the Rigveda 1) i. 158, 5. as a Dāsa, an enemy of Dīrghatamas, who seems to have engaged him in single combat and defeated him. The St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests that he is rather a supernatural being allied to Trita (cf. the Avestan Thrita and Thraetaona). 2) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 68. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 151; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 144.

traidhaatva|त्रैधात्व
त्रै-धात्व<BR> (‘descendant of Tridhātu,’) is the patronymic of Tryaruṇa in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 3, 12).

traipada|त्रैपद
त्रै-पद,<BR> neut., occurs as a measure of distance, ‘threequarters’ of a Yojana, in the Pañcāviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, where half a Yojana is termed Gavyūti and a quarter Krośa. 1) xvi. 13. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiv. 41, 12. 

traivaNi|त्रैवणि
त्रैवणि<BR> is mentioned as a pupil of Aupacandhani or Aupajandhani in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) ii. 6, 3 (Kāṇva = ii. 5, 21 Mādhyaṃdina); iv. 6, 3 (= iv. 5, 27). In the Mādhyaṃdina recension 2) iv. 5, 27. his name occurs twice in the second Vaṃśa, in both cases as a pupil of Aupajandhani.

traivRShNa|त्रैवृष्ण
त्रै-वृष्ण,<BR> ‘descendant of Trivṛṣan,’ is the patronymic of Trayaruṇa in the Rigveda (v. 27, 1).

tryaruNatraivRShNatrasadasyu|त्र्यरुणत्रैवृष्णत्रसदस्यु
त्र्य्-अरुण त्रै-वृष्ण त्रसदस्यु<BR> is the name of a prince whose generosity to a singer is celebrated in a hymn of the Rigveda. 1) v. 27, 1-3. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 2) xiii. 3, 12. Cf. the Tāṇḍaka recension, cited in Sāyaṇa, on Rv. v. 2, where Trasadasyu is given as the king's name. he appears as Tryaruṇa Traidhātva Aikṣvāka, and is the hero of the following story. He was out in his chariot with his Purohita, or domestic priest, Vṛśa Jāna, and by excessive speed in driving killed a Brahmin boy. This sin was atoned for by the Purohita's using his Vārśa Sāman (chant). The Śāṭyāyana Brāhmaṇa, cited by Sāyaṇa, 3) On Rv., loc. cit. See also the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa version in Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 20. elaborates the tale. As Vṛśa had held the reins, king and priest accused each other of the murder. The Ikṣvākus being consulted threw the responsibility for the crime on Vṛśa, who thereupon revived the boy by the Vārśa Sāman. In consequence of this unfairness of theirs--being Kṣatriyas they were partial to a Kṣatriya--Agni's glow ceased to burn in their houses. In response to their appeal to restore it, Vṛśa came to them, saw the Piśācī (demoness), who, in the form of Trasadasyu's wife, had stolen the glow, and succeeded in restoring it to Agni. This version with some variations occurs also in the Bṛhaddevatā, 4) v. 14 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. which connects the story with a hymn of the Rigveda. 5) v. 2. Sieg's attempt 6) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 64-76. Cf. Geldner, Festtgruss an Roth, 192. to show that the hymn really refers to this tale is not at all successful. 7) See Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 366 et seq.; Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 312; Hillebrandt, Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1903, 240 et seq. It is clear that Trasadasyu must here mean ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ and not King Trasadasyu himself. The difference of the patronymics, Traivṛṣṇa and Traidhātva, by which he is referred to can best be explained by assuming that there were two kings, Trivṛṣan and Tridhātu (or possibly Tridhanvan), from whom Tryaruṇa was descended. 8) See Sieg, op. cit., 74-76, and Trasadasyu. The connexion with the Ikṣvākus is important (see Ikṣvāku).

tryavi|त्र्यवि
त्र्य्-अवि<BR> designates a calf eighteen months old 1) The etymological meaning is apparently ‘having three sheep (periods)’ -that is, ‘having periods of thrice six months,’ just as the adjective pañcāvi means ‘having five periods of six months,’ or ‘thirty months old.’ in the Rigveda 2) iii. 55, 14. and later Saṃhitās. 3) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 2; xviii. 12, etc. (in the form triyavi); Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 10; xviii. 26, etc.

tryaashir|त्र्याशिर्
त्र्य्-आशिर्,<BR> ‘with three admixtures,’ is an epithet of Soma in the Rigveda. 1) v. 27, 5. Cf. perhaps viii. 2, 7 (traya Indrasya somāḥ sutāsaḥ, ‘three kinds of Soma pressed for Indra’). According to Sāyaṇa this means mixed with curds (Dadhi), meal (Saktu), and milk (Payas). More accurately it would seem 2) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologic, 1, 209; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 422. to denote the milk (gavāśir), the barley (yavāśir), and the curds (dadhyāśir), which were used to mix with the Soma.

tvach|त्वच्
त्वच्,<BR> ‘skin,’ ‘hide,’ (a) denotes specially in the Rigveda 1) i. 79, 3; iii. 21, 5; ix. 65, 25; 66, 29; 70, 7; 79, 4; 101, 11, 16, etc. the hide used in the process of extracting the Soma juice from the plant. The Soma was pounded with stones (adri) upon the skin laid on the pressing boards (adhiṣavaṇe phalake), 2) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologic, 1, 181-183, and Adhisavaṇa. which, however, are not mentioned in the Rigveda. Or if a pestle and mortar were used, the skin was still placed underneath them to catch the drops of juice, not above, as Pischel 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 110. thought. (b) Tvac also denotes the rind of the Soma plant that remains after the juice has been extracted. 4) Rv. ix. 86, 44; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, 13, 1; Hillebrandt, op. cit., 52. (c) Metaphorically the term kṛṣṇā tvac, ‘the black skins,’ is applied to the aboriginal enemies of the invading Āryans. 5) Rv. i. 130, 8, and probably ix. 41, 1, for which, however, cf. Hillebrandt, op. cit., 51, n. 2, and see Dāsa.

tvaShTR|त्वष्टृ
त्वष्टृ<BR> is employed once in the Atharvaveda 1) xii. 3, 33. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 688; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 651. to denote a ‘carpenter,’ with a deliberate play on the name of the god Tvaṣṭṛ. He is there mentioned as using an axe (svadhiti) to fashion (from wood) ‘a well-made form’ (rūpaṃ sukṛtam). See Taṣṭṛ.

tvaaShTra|त्वाष्ट्र
त्वाष्ट्र,<BR> ‘descendant of Tvaṣṭṛ,’ is the patronymic, in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 1) ii. 6, 3 (Kāṇva = ii. 5, 22 Mādhyaṃdina); iv. 6, 3 (= iv. 5, 28). of the mythical teacher Ābhūti.

tsaru|त्सरु
त्सरु,<BR> --(a) This word seems to denote some sort of crawling animal in one passage of the Rigveda. 1) vii. 50, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99. (b) In the later literature the word means a ‘handle,’ as of a beaker (Camasa). 1) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 4. Cf. Lāṭyāyana Srauta Sūtra, x. 12, 12, etc. In this sense also it seems to occur in the description of the plough (Lāṅgala) in the Atharvaveda 2) iii. 17, 3, where the ordinary text has soma-satsaru (so the Pada text), and the Paippalāda recension has somapitsalam. and the later Saṃhitās. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 5, 6, has sumati-tsaru; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 7, 12; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvi. 12; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xii. 71; Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, ii. 34, have somapitsaru, which Vasiṣṭha renders as ‘provided with a handle for the drinker of Soma’ (i.e., somapi-tsaru). Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 255, suggests soma-sa-tsaru, ‘with (sa-) strap (uman, a conjectural word) and handle’ (tsaru). Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 116, prefers to read throughout sumati-tsaru, ‘with well-smoothed handle,’ from the root seen in matī-kṛ, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236; Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, 13. 

tsaarin|त्सारिन्
त्सारिन्<BR> denotes, in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 134, 5. a ‘hunter’ engaged in the chase of the takva (an unknown beast), according to Ludwig and Max Müller. 2) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 448. But this explanation is quite conjectural. D.

daMsha|दंश
दंश<BR> (lit., ‘biter’), ‘gad-fly,’ is mentioned in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (vi. 9, 3; 10, 2).

daMShTra|दंष्ट्र
दंष्ट्र,<BR> denoting a prominent tooth, ‘tusk,’ or ‘fang’ of an animal, occurs often from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. ii. 13, 4; x. 87, 3; Av. iv. 36, 2; x. 5, 43; xvi. 7, 3, etc.

daxakaatyaayaniaatreya|दक्षकात्यायनिआत्रेय
दक्ष कात्यायनि आत्रेय<BR> (‘descendant of Atri’) is mentioned in the Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 41, 1; iv. 17, 1) as a pupil of Śaṅkha Bābhravya.

daxajayantalauhitya|दक्षजयन्तलौहित्य
दक्ष जयन्त लौहित्य<BR> (‘descendant of Lohita’) is mentioned in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 42, 1) as a pupil of Kṛṣṇarāta Lauhitya.

daxapaarvati|दक्षपार्वति
दक्ष पार्वति<BR> (‘descendant of Parvata’) is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) ii. 4, 4, 6. as having performed a certain rite which his descendants, the Dākṣāyaṇas, still maintained, thus enjoying royal dignity down to the time of the Brāhmaṇa itself. He appears in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 2) iv. 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 223; 4, 358; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 374 et seq.; Lévi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 138. also.

daxiNataskaparda|दक्षिणतस्कपर्द
दक्षिणतस्-कपर्द<BR> is an epithet of the Vasiṣṭhas in the Rigveda (vii. 33, 1) referring to their mode of ‘wearing the hair in a braid on the right side.’ See Kaparda. 

daxiNaa|दक्षिणा
दक्षिणा<BR> appears repeatedly in the Rigveda 1) A whole hymn, Rv. x. 107, is devoted to its praise. Cf. i. 168, 7; vi. 27, 8; viii. 24, 29; 39, 5; x. 62, 1, etc. and later 2) Av. iv. 11, 4; v. 7, 11; xi. 7, 9; 8, 22; xiii. 1, 52; xviii. 4, 8, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 7, 3, 1; 8, 1, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iv. 19, 23; xix. 30; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 3, 3 et seq.; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 9, 3, 1 et seq. The verses (gāthā nārāśaṃsī, either as a single expression or as two separate terms) used to win these Dakṣiṇās were notoriously false. See Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiv. 5; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 2, 6. 7; Nirukta, i. 7; xi. 2. as the designation of the gift presented to priests at the sacrifice, apparently because a cow--a prolific (dakṣiṇā) one--was the usual ‘fee’ 3) The transition of meaning is similar in the use of the English word ‘fee’; ‘cattle,’ ‘money,’ ‘payment for service’ (see Murray's English Dictionary, s.v. ‘fee’). Cf. also Go-dāna, n. 4. on such an occasion. 4) Cf. the rule that when nothing is specified a cow is the Dakṣiṇā, Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 2, 13; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 1, 2. The later Dāna-stutis, or ‘Praises of Gifts,’ in the Rigveda immensely exaggerate these donations, and the exaggeration grows in the Brāhmaṇas. It is important to notice that these enumerations of gifts in the main include nothing but articles of personal property, such as kine, horses, buffaloes, or camels (uṣṭra), ornaments, and so forth, but not land. 5) So, e.g., Rv. i. 126, 1-4; v. 30, 12-15; viii. 1, 32. 33; 3, 21 et seq.; 4, 19-21; 5, 37-39; 6, 46-48; 55; 56; vii. 18, 21-24, and the full list in Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 273-277. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 49 et seq. Clothes (vāsas) and gold are mentioned as a Dakṣiṇā in Av. ix. 5, 14. The four Dakṣiṇās, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 3, 4, 7, are gold, a cow, clothes, and a horse. This is practically exhaustive if the trappings of the horse and ornaments are included. Reference is, however, made in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 6) xiii. 7, 1, 13, with which compare xiii. 6, 2, 18, where the Brahmin's land is excluded; and see xiii. 7, 1, 15, where the gift of land is disapproved. to land as a Dakṣiṇā, but with disapproval, probably because the land came to be regarded as inalienable without the consent of the clansmen. 7) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 1, 1, 4. Cf. above, pp. 100, n. 19, 246; below, pp. 351, 352. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 169171; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 104, 105; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 96-98; Bloomfield, Religion of the Veda, 69-74; Atharvaveda, 76 et seq., 100, 121.

daxiNaapatha|दक्षिणापथ
दक्षिणा-पथ<BR> (lit., ‘the road to the south’), ‘the south country,’ is found, probably as a designation of the Deccan, as early as the Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra, 1) i. 1, 2, 13. Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 394, n., and Baudhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, v. 13. coupled with Surāṣṭra. A similar expression is dakṣiṇā padā, ‘with southward foot,’ in the Rigveda, 2) x. 61, 8. referring to the place where the exile (parā-vṛj) goes on being expelled. This no doubt simply means ‘the south’ beyond the limits of the recognized Āryan world, which even as late as the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 3) ii. 13. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 185; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 408; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 30; Keith Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 28, n. 1; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 200. appears as bounded by the Vindhyas on the south.

daxiNaapraShTi|दक्षिणाप्रष्टि
दक्षिणा-प्रष्टि<BR> denotes ‘the side horse on the right.’ It appears from two passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) v. 1, 4, 9; ix. 4, 2, 11 (this passage appears to speak of three horses only, but of. v. 4, 3, 17). Cf. also Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 13, 12. that there were at times four horses yoked to the chariot, the right and the left yoke horse (dakṣiṇā-yugya, savyā-yugya) in the middle, flanked by one on each side, the two latter of course not being fastened to the yoke at all, but presumably by traces alongside of the yoke horses. See Ratha.

daxiNaayana|दक्षिणायन
दक्षिणायन<BR> See Sūrya.

daxiNaayugya|दक्षिणायुग्य
दक्षिणा-युग्य,<BR> ‘the yoke horse on the right,’ is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (v. 1, 4, 6; 4, 3, 8; ix. 4, 2, 11). See Ratha.

daNDa|दण्ड
दण्ड,<BR> ‘staff.’ (a) This word is often mentioned in the ordinary sense; for example, when used for driving cattle 1) Rv. vii. 33, 6. (go-ajanāsaḥ), or as a weapon. 2) Av. v. 5, 4. Cf. Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 35; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 4, 6, etc. A staff was given to a man on consecration for driving away demons, according to the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa. 3) iii. 2, 1, 32. The staff also played a part in the initiation (upanayana) of a youth on attaining manhood. 4) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 19; 22; Sāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, ii. 1, 6, 11, etc. In a modified sense the word is used to denote the handle of a ladle or similar implement. 5) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 5; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 4, 1, 36. Of a musical instrument, Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, viii. 9; Śrauta Sūtra, xvii. 3, 1 et seq. (b) The ‘staff’ as the symbol of temporal power, implying punishment, is applied by the king (rāja-preṣito daṇḍaḥ). 1) Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 15. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 4, 7, where the king, being himself ‘exempt from punishment’ (a-daṇḍya), inflicts judicial punishment (daṇḍa-vadha). The king, in modern phraseology, was the source of criminal law; and he clearly retained this branch of law in his own hands even in later times. 2) Foy, Die königliche Gewalt, 21 et seq. The punishment of the non-guilty (a-daṇḍya) is given as one of the characteristics of the nonBrahminical Vrātyas in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 3) xvii. 1, 9; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 33. See also Dharma.

daNDaaupara|दण्डऔपर
दण्ड औपर<BR> (‘descendant of Upara’) is mentioned in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (vi. 2, 9, 4) and the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (iii. 8, 7) as having performed a certain rite.

daNDana|दण्डन
दण्डन<BR> occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) xii. 2, 54. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 682. among other names of ‘reed’ or ‘cane.’

dattataapasa|दत्ततापस
दत्त तापस<BR> was Hotṛ priest at the snake festival described in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

dadhi|दधि
दधि,<BR> ‘sour milk,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda 1) viii. 2, 9; ix. 87, 1, etc. and later. 2) Av. iii. 12, 7; iv. 34, 6; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 3, 4, etc.; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xviii. 5, 12, etc. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3) i. 8, 1, 7. Cf. Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 348. mentions in order Ghrta (‘clarified butter’), Dadhi, Mastu, which Eggeling 4) Sacred Books of the East, 12, 218. renders ‘whey,’ and Āmikṣā, ‘curds.’ Dadhi often has the meaning of ‘curds’ also. It was used for mixing with Soma. 5) Dadhyāśir, ‘mixed with sour milk,’ is an epithet of Soma in Rv. i. 5, 5; 137, 2; v. 51, 7; vii. 32, 4. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 219 et seq. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 227.

dadhyancaatharvaNa|दध्यञ्चाथर्वण
दध्यञ्च् आथर्वण<BR> is a purely mythical sage. In the Rigveda 1) i. 80, 16; 84, 13, 14; 116, 12; 117, 22; 119, 9, etc. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 141, 142; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 176. he is clearly a divinity of some kind, but in the later Saṃhitās 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 4, 4; 6, 6, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xix. 4. and the Brāhmaṇas 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 5, 18; vi. 4, 2, 3; xiv. 1, 1, 18. 20. 25; 4, 13; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28, etc. he is metamorphosed into a teacher. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmana 4) xii. 8, 6. So also Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 21. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xxxv; Atharvaveda, 23, 116, 118, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. he is by oversight called an Āṅgirasa.

dadhyaashir|दध्याशिर्
दध्य्-आशिर्<BR> See Dadhi and Soma.

dant|dat|दत्|दन्त्
दन्त्, दन्त,<BR> ‘tooth,’ is frequently mentioned from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. vii. 55, 2; x. 68, 6; Av. v. 23, 3; 29, 4; vi. 56, 3, etc. The more usual form is Danta, Rv. iv. 6, 8; vi. 75, 11; Av. iv. 3, 6, etc. Cleansing (dhāv) the teeth was an ordinary act, especially in preparation for a sacrifice, and accompanied bathing, shaving of the hair and beard (keśa-śmaśru), and the cutting of the nails. 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 6, 2 (not exactly paralleled in Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 1, 2 et seq.). A hymn of the Atharvaveda 3) vi. 140. celebrates the appearance of the first two teeth of a child, though its exact interpretation is doubtful. 4) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 321; Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 224; Grill, Hundert Lieder,^2 176; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 540, 541; Atharvaveda, 71; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 386. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 5) vii. 14; Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xv. 18. there is a reference to a child's first teeth falling out. The word seems in the Rigveda 6) iv. 6, 8; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 99; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 341, 342. once to denote an elephant's tusk. Whether dentistry was practised is doubtful. The occurrence in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka 7) ii. 1, 5. of Hiraṇya-dant, ‘gold-toothed,’ as the name of a man, is perhaps significant, especially as it is certain that the stopping of teeth with gold was known at Rome as early as the legislation of the Twelve Tables. 8) Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 206. See Wordsworth, Fragments and Specimens of Early Latin, 537.

dabhiiti|दभीति
दभीति<BR> appears several times in the Rigveda as a hero or sage. Indra overcomes on his behalf Cumuri and Dhuni; 1) x. 113, 9; ii. 15, 9; vii. 19, 4. he pressed Soma for Indra, 2) vi. 20, 13. who rewarded him. 3) vi. 26, 6. For him 30,000 Dāsas were sent to sleep, 4) iv. 30, 21. and for him the Dasyus were bound without cords. 5) ii. 13, 9. Dabhīti also appears, with Turvīti, as a protégé of the Aśvins. 6) i. 112, 23. There seems no reason to deny that he was a real person. 7) Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 155, 157, 158. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 162.

dama|दम
दम,<BR> ‘house,’ is a word that occurs several times in the Rigveda. 1) i. 1, 8; 61, 9; 75, 5; 143, 4; ii. 1, 2, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, viii. 24. It denotes, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. But this seems very doubtful in view of the apparent connexion of  and , ‘build,’ in Greek. the place in which a man wields uncontrolled power (from the root dam, ‘control’).

dampati|दम्पति
दम्-पति<BR> denotes ‘the master of the house’ 1) For the form, cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 37, n. 9. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2. 307 et seq., argues in favour of the spelling daṃpati (adopted by Geldner in his Ṛgveda, Glossar). Cf. patir dan. Rv. i. 149, 2; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 176, 177. in the Rigveda, 2) i. 127, 8; ii. 39, 2; v. 22, 4; viii. 69. 16; 84, 7. but is more often used in the dual to designate ‘the master and the mistress,’ 3) Rv. v. 3, 2; viii. 31, 5; x. 10, 5; 68, 2; 85, 32; 95, 12, etc.; Av. vi. 123, 3; xii. 3, 14; xiv. 2, 9, etc. Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 418, 420. an expression that may legitimately be deemed to show the high status of women at the time of the Rigveda. See Strī.

darbha|दर्भ
दर्भ<BR> is the name of a grass in the Rigveda 1) i. 191, 3 (with Śara and Kuśara, varieties of grass). and later. 2) Av. vi. 43, 2; viii. 7, 20; x. 4, 13; xi. 6, 15; xix. 28, 1. etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 5, 1, 4, etc. In the Atharvaveda it is used for the calming of anger (manyuśamana), 3) Av. vi. 43. and as an amulet for protection against the scattering of one's hair or the striking of one's breast. 4) xix. 32, 2. Cf. xix. 30. It is also said to be ‘rich in roots’ (bhūri-mūla), 5) Av. vi. 43, 2. to possess a thousand leaves (sahasra-parṇa) and a hundred stalks (śata-kāṇḍa). 6) Av. xix. 32, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70. 

darvi|दर्वि
दर्वि,<BR> or Darvī, properly denotes a ‘ladle,’ in which sense it is found in the Rigveda 1) v. 6, 9; x. 105, 10. and later. 2) Av. iii. 10, 7; iv. 14, 7; ix. 6, 17, etc. But the word also means a serpent's ‘hood’ in the Atharvaveda, 3) x. 1, 13. See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 577. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 153. though Zimmer regards it as the name of a serpent. ^4 Altindisches Leben, 95, where he takes Karikrata also as the name of a snake.

darvidaa|दर्विदा
दर्विदा,<BR> the ‘woodpecker,’ is mentioned as a victim at the Aśvamedha or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 13, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 15, Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93. The St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., suggests ‘woodpiercer’ (dāru-vidha) as the literal sense. On the etymology, cf. F. W. Thomas's article. ‘The D.Suffix,’ p. 121, in Transactions of the Cambridge Philological Society, 5, part ii. Cf. Dārvāghāta.

darsha|दर्श
दर्श<BR> (‘appearance’) denotes the new moon day, 1) Av. vii. 81, 3, 4; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 1, 14; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 2, 2, 1. usually in opposition to the day of full moon (pūrṇa-māsa). 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 4, 1, etc. Most frequently the word occurs in the compound 3) Ibid., i. 6, 7, 1; 9, 3; ii. 5, 6, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 2, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 5, 11, etc. darśa-pūrṇamāsau, ‘new and full moon,’ the days of special ritual importance. 4) Hillebrandt, Das altindische Neuund Vollmondsopfer, Jena, 1880; Rituallitteratur, 111-114; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 439. The order of the first two words here is worthy of note, for it distinctly suggests, though it does not conclusively prove, that the month was reckoned from new moon to new moon, not from full moon to full moon. See Māsa.

dashagva|दशग्व
दश-ग्व<BR> appears in one hymn of the Rigveda 1) viii. 12, 2 as the name of a person who was assisted by Indra. The other references in that work, 2) They are mentioned with the Navagvas in i. 62, 4; iii. 39, 5; iv. 51, 4; v. 29, 12; x. 62, 6, and alone in ii. 34, 12. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 144 (C). however, clearly show the mythical character of the Daśagvas, and of any individual among them. 

dashatayii|दशतयी
दशतयी<BR> in the Nirukta 1) vii. 8. 20; xi. 16; xii. 40. frequently denotes the text of the Rigveda as divided into ten Maṇḍalas.

dashadyu|दशद्यु
दश-द्यु<BR> appears twice in the Rigveda 1) i. 33, 14; vi. 26, 4. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 55, 328. as the name of a hero, but nothing can be made out regarding him or his relation to Vetasu, who is mentioned in one passage along with him.

dashan|दशन्
दशन्,<BR> ‘ten,’ forms the basis of the numerical system of the Vedic Indians, as it does of the Āryan people generally. But it is characteristic of India 1) Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 70. that there should be found at a very early period long series of names for very high numerals, whereas the Āryan knowledge did not go beyond 1,000. In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 2) xvii. 2 et seq. Cf. xxii. 34; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ix. 1, 2, 16. the list is 1; 10; 100; 1,000; 10,000 (ayuta); 100,000 (niyuta); 1,000,000 (prayuta); 10,000,000 (arbuda); 100,000,000 (nyarbuda); 1,000,000,000 (samudra); 10,000,000,000 (madhya); 100,000,000,000 (anta); 1,000,000,000,000 (parārdha). In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 3) xxxix. 6. In xvii. 10 the number badva disappears, and the list corresponds with that of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, except for the fact that niyuta and prayuta change places. the list is the same, but niyuta and prayuta exchange places, and after nyarbuda a new figure (badva) intervenes, thus increasing samudra to 10,000,000,000, and so on. The Taittirīya Saṃhitā has in two places 4) iv. 4, 11, 4; vii. 2, 20, 1. exactly the same list as the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. The Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 5) ii. 8, 14. has the list ayuta, prayuta, then ayuta again, arbuda, nyarbuda, samudra, madhya, anta, parārdha. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 6) xvii. 14, 2. has the Vājasaneyi list up to nyarbuda inclusive, then follow nikharvaka, badva, akṣita, and apparently go = 1,000,000,000,000. The Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 7) i. 10, 28, 29. Cf. Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v. 3, 2; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 30, n. 2; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka 293, 294. list replaces nikharvaka by nikharva, badva by padma, and ends with akṣitir vyomāntaḥ. The Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 8) xv. 11, 7. continues the series after nyarbuda with nikharvāda, samudra, salila, antya, ananta (= 10 billions). But beyond ayuta 9) Cf. Rv. iii. 6, 15; viii. 1, 5; 2, 41, 21, 18; 34, 15; 46, 22; Av. viii. 2, 21; 8, 7; x. 8, 24; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xix. 13, 6; xxi. 18, 3, etc. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 348, considers that it has not any definite sense in the Rigveda; this cannot be either proved or disproved. The Rv. has the phrase śatā sahasrāṇi several times (iv. 32, 18; viii. 32, 18, etc.) = 100,000; and ayuta may easily have been already specialized, though it may also have retained a vague sense. none of these numbers has any vitality. Badva, indeed, occurs in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 10) vii. 21. 23. but it cannot there have any precise numerical sense; 11) Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 96. and later on the names of these high numerals are very much confused. An arithmetical progression of some interest is found in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 12) xviii. 3. Cf. Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 10, 1 et seq.; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxii. 9, 1-6. where occurs a list of sacrificial gifts in which each successive figure doubles the amount of the preceding one. It begins with dvādaśa-mānaṃ hiraṇyam, ‘gold to the value of 12’ (the unit being uncertain, but probably the Kṛṣṇala), 13) Cf. Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxii. 9, 1; Weber, op. cit., 102, 103. followed by ‘to the value of 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, 768, 1,536, 3072,’ then dve aṣṭāviṃśati-śata-māne, which must mean 2×128×24 (the last unit being not a single māna, but a number of 24 mānas) = 6,144, then 12,288, 24,576, 49,152, 98,304, 196,608, 393, 216. With these large numbers may be compared the minute theoretical subdivision of time found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 14) xii. 3, 2, 1 et seq. Cf. also Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 1, 1, where a series of names of the divisions of the muhūrta is given, apparently as alternatives, not as successive stages (idānīm, tadānīm, etarhi, kṣipram, ajiram, āśuḥ (? āśu), nimeṣaḥ, phaṇaḥ, dravan, atidravan, tvaran, tvaramāṇaḥ, āśuḥ, āśīyān, javaḥ). See Weber, op. cit., 92-94. where a day is divided into 15 muhūrtas--1 muhūrta = 15 kṣipras, 1 kṣipra = 15 etarhis, 1 etarhi = 15 idānis, 1 idāni = 15 prāṇas. The Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 15) xiv. 75 et seq. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Araṇyaka, vii. 20. has a decimal division of the day into 15 muhūrtas-1 muhūrta = 10 nimeṣas, 1 nimeṣa = 10 dhvaṃsis. Few fractions are mentioned in Vedic literature. Ardha, pāda, śapha, and kalā denote (1/2), (1/4), (1/8), (1/16) respectively, but only the first two are common. Tṛtīya denotes the third part. 16) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 1, 4; v. 2, 6, 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 6, 1; 7, 1, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 4, 4, etc. In the Rigveda 17) vi. 69, 8 = Av. vii. 44, 1 = Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 11, 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 15; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 1, 13. Indra and Viṣṇu are said to have divided 1,000 by 3, though how they did so is uncertain. Tri-pād denotes ‘three-fourths.’ 18) Rv. x. 90, 4. There is no clear evidence that the Indians of the Vedic period had any knowledge of numerical figures, though it is perfectly possible. 19) If aṣṭa-karṇī means in Rv. x. 62, 7, having the figure 8 marked on the ears' of cattle, then the mention of numerical signs would be certain. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 234, 235, 348. But this is doubtful. See Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 309, n. 10. Cf.

dashamaasya|दशमास्य
दश-मास्य,<BR> ‘ten months old,’ describes in the Rigveda 1) v. 78, 7-8. and later 2) Av. i. 11, 6; iii. 23, 2. There are several references in Vedic literature to birth in the tenth month, as Rv. x. 184, 3, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 366; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 313, n. 1. the embryo immediately before birth. See Māsa.

dashamii|दशमी
दशमी<BR> denotes in the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 4, 7. and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 2) xxii. 14. the period of life between 90 and 100 years which the Rigveda 3) i. 158, 6. calls the daśama yuga, ‘the tenth stage of life.’ Longevity seems not to have been rare among the Vedic Indians, for the desire to live a ‘hundred autumns’ (śaradaḥ śatam) is constantly expressed. 4) Rv. i. 89, 9; x. 18, 10, and passim. See Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 384; Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 62, 63.

Probably the number was always rather imaginary than real, but the comparative brevity of modern life in India 9) Indian Empire, 1, 513 et seq. may be accounted for by the cumulative effect of fever, which is hardly known to the Rigveda. See Takman.

dashavRxa|दशवृक्ष
दश-वृक्ष<BR> is the name of a tree, according to Roth, 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. in the Atharvaveda. 2) ii. 9, 1. But Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 50. treats the word as a mere adjective meaning ‘of ten trees.’

dashavraja|दशव्रज
दश-व्रज<BR> is the name of a protégé of the Aśvins in the Rigveda (viii. 8, 20; 49, 1; 50, 9).

dashashipra|दशशिप्र
दश-शिप्र<BR> is the name of a sacrificer mentioned in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 52, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163.

dashaa|दशा
दशा<BR> denotes the ‘fringe’ or ‘border’ of a garment (vāsaḥ) in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) iii. 3, 2, 9, and often in the Sūtras. The word also occurs in the compound daśā-pavitra, 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 32; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 2, 2, 11. Cf. iv. 1, 1. 28. which means ‘a filtering cloth with a fringe.’ 

dashoNi|दशोणि
दशोणि<BR> appears in one passage of the Rigveda 1) vi. 20, 4, 8. apparently as a favourite of Indra and as opposed to the Paṇis, who fell in hundreds for his benefit. The view of Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 156; 5, 107. that he is here the priest of the Paṇis is very improbable. Elsewhere his name is simply mentioned. 3) x. 96, 12, where, however, the word may be merely an epithet of Soma. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 92, n. 1; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 55, 328. See also Daśoṇya.

dashoNya|दशोण्य
दशोण्य<BR> is the name of a sacrificer mentioned in the Rigveda 1) viii. 52, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. along with Daśaśipra and others. Whether he is identical with Daśoṇi cannot be decided.

दशोनसि<BR> is the name of a kind of snake in the Atharvaveda. 1) x. 4, 17. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 577. The reading of the Paippalāda recension is Naśonaśī.

dasyavevRka|दस्यवेवृक
दस्यवे वृक,<BR> ‘wolf to the Dasyu,’ is the name of a man mentioned four times in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 51, 2; 55, 1; 56, 1. 2. In one hymn 2) viii. 51. he is called a Ṛṣi, but in two others 3) viii. 55. 56. he is clearly a prince victorious over the Dasyus, and a generous patron of the singer. It is hardly necessary to assume different persons, 4) Especially as the name occurs only in the small collection of Kāṇva hymns forming the Vālakhilya group in the eighth Maṇḍala. for the term Ṛṣi is not altogether inconsistent with royalty. He was son of Pūtakratu 5) viii. 56, 2. Pautakrata. Cf. viii. 68, 17. and Pūtakratā, 6) viii. 56, 4. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 139, 164; 5, 552. his wife.

dasyavesaha|दस्यवेसह
दस्यवे सह<BR> is, according to Roth, 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. the name of a man or a clan in the Rigveda. 2) i. 36, 18. But he admits that the words may be an epithet of Agni. This is the interpretation given to them by Oldenberg. 3) Sacred Books of the East, 46, 33.

dasyu|दस्यु
दस्यु,<BR> a word of somewhat doubtful origin, is in many passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 34, 7; 100, 18; ii. 13, 9, etc. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 157, 158. clearly applied to superhuman enemies. On the other hand, there are several passages in which human foes, probably the aborigines, are thus designated. This may be regarded as certain in those passages where the Dasyu is opposed to the Āryan, who defeats him with the aid of the gods. 2) Rv. i. 51, 8; 103, 3; 117, 21; ii. 11, 18, 19; iii. 34, 9; vi. 18, 3; vii. 5, 6; x. 49, 3. Probably also in v. 70, 3; x. 83, 6, people are meant. The great difference between the Dasyus and the Āryans was their religion: the former are styled ‘not sacrificing,’ ‘devoid of rites,’ ‘addicted to strange vows,’ ‘godhating,’ and so forth. 3) The Dasyu is called a-karman, ‘riteless,’ x. 22, 8; a-devayu, ‘indifferent to the gods,’ viii. 70, 11; a-brahman, ‘without devotion,’ iv. 16, 9; a-yajvan, ‘not sacrificing,’ viii. 70, 11; a-yajyu, id., vii. 6, 3; a-vrata, ‘lawless,’ i. 51, 8; 175, 3; vi. 14, 3; ix. 41, 2; anyavrata, ‘following strange ordinances,’ viii. 70, 11; deva-pīyu, ‘reviling the gods,’ Av. xii. 1, 37. It is impossible in all cases to be certain that people are meant. As compared with the Dāsa, they are less distinctively a people: no clans (viśaḥ) of the Dasyus are mentioned, and while Indra's dasyu-hatya, ‘slaughter of the Dasyus,’ is often spoken of, there is no corresponding use of dāsa-hatya. That the Dasyus were real people is, however, shown by the epithet anās applied to them in one passage of the Rigveda. 5) Rv. v. 29, 10. The sense of this word is not absolutely certain: the Pada text and Sāyaṇa both take it to mean ‘without face’ (an-ās), 6) This sense allows of two interpretations: ‘misfeatured,’ which seems that of Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and Grassmann, Wörterbuch; or ‘speechless’ (that is, unable to speak the language of the Āryans), which is that of Bollensen, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 41, 496. but the other rendering, ‘noseles’ (a-nās), is quite possible, 7) This view is supported by Megasthenes' report as to natives who were : see Strabo, p. 711; Pliny, Nat. Hist., vii. 2, 18, cited by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 430. See also Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 109; 5, 95; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 277; Knauer, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 29, 52; Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 2, 293 (accent). 4 Rv. i. 51, 5, 6; 103, 4; x. 95, 7; 99, 7; 105, 11. Cf. dasyu-han. ‘Dasyuslaying,’ i. 100, 12; vi. 45, 24; viii. 76, 11; 77, 3; x. 47, 4 (all of Indra); vi. 16, 15; viii. 39, 8 (of Agni), etc. and would accord well with the flat-nosed aborigines of the Dravidian 8) The suggestion in the Indian Empire, 1, 390, that the modern Brahui type is the true Dravidian, while the modern Dravidian is the result of fusion with Muṇḍā-speaking tribes, would render this theory improbable. But it seems more probable that the Brahuis in speech preserve the tradition of Dravidian settlements in North India. type, whose language still persists among the Brahuis, who are found in the north-west. This interpretation would receive some support from Vṛtra's being called ‘broken-nosed’ if this were a correct explanation of the obscure word rujānās. 9) See Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 17, 415 (who takes rujānāḥ of Rv. i. 32, 8, as = rujāna-nāḥ); Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 31, 32 (who suggests as possible the analysis of the word as rujā-anāḥ). But cf. Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 361, who suggests the emendation rujānaḥ as nominative singular of the simple participle ‘broken’; Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 59, n. 1. The other epithet of the Dasyus is mṛdhra-vāc, which occurs with anās, 10) Rv. v. 29, 10. and which has been rendered 11) Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2^2, 393 et seq. ‘of stammering, or unintelligible speech.’ This version is by no means certain, and since the epithet is elsewhere 12) The expression is used of the Āryan Pūrus in vii. 18, 13; of the Paṇis in vii. 6, 3; and of hostile persons in i. 174, 2; v. 32, 8; x. 23, 5. Roth, Erläuterungen zum Nirukta, 97, thinks the sense is ‘of insulting speech,’ and Zimmer, op. cit., 114, 115, strongly supports this view. But Hillebrandt, op. cit., 1, 89, 90, 114, prefers to see in it ‘speaking an enemy's speech,’ and thinks that the Pūrus were dialectically different from the Bharatas--a view which can be supported from the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 1, 23, 24, where the Asuras say he'lavo (= he'rayo, ‘ho, enemies,’ in Sanskrit). See Muir, op. cit., 2^2, 114; Davidson, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 37, 23 (the Mahābhāṣya version); Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 31, n. 3. The word could thus apply to the Dasyus also, as the strange speech of the enemy could be either Āryan or aboriginal. applied to Āryans, its correct meaning is more probably ‘of hostile speech.’ Dasyu corresponds with the Iranian daṅhu, daqyu, which denotes a ‘province.’ Zimmer 13) Op. cit., 110 et seq. So Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 158. thinks that the original meaning was ‘enemy,’ whence the Iranians developed the sense of ‘hostile country,’ ‘conquered country,’ ‘province,’ while the Indians, retaining the signification of ‘enemy,’ extended it to include demon foes. Roth 14) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. considers that the meaning of human enemy is a transfer from the strife of gods and demons. Lassen 15) Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 633 et seq. This theory is now generally discredited. Cf. Justi, Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1866, 1446 et seq.; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 142; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 162 et seq.; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 156. attempted to onnect the contrast daqyu: dasyu with that of daeva: deva, and to see in it a result of the religious differences which, according to Haug's theory, had separated the Iranians and the Indians. The word may have originally meant ‘ravaged land’ 16) Both this word and Dāsa appear to be derived from the root das, which, according to Whitney, Roots, means ‘lay waste’; but, according to Roth, ‘suffer want,’ ‘waste away.’ as a result of invasion; hence ‘enemies’ country,' then ‘hostile people,’ who as human foes were more usually called by the cognate name of Dāsa. Individual Dasyus are Cumuri, Śambara, Śuṣṇa, etc. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 17) vii. 18, where the descendants of Viśvāmitra are called dasyūnāṃ bhūyiṣṭhāḥ; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 26, 7. the word has, as later, 18) Manu, v. 131; x. 32. 45; Zimmer, op. cit., 118. Cf. Hillebrandt, op. cit., 3, 276 et seq.; Zimmer, op. cit., 101 et seq. the sense of uncivilized peoples generally.

daaxaayaNa|दाक्षायण
दाक्षायण,<BR> ‘descendant of Dakṣa.’ The Dākṣāyaṇas are mentioned in the Atharvaveda and the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Av. i. 35, 1, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 51, 52; Kaṭha, cited by von Schroeder, Tūbinger Kaṭha-Handschriften, 36; Khila, iv. 7, 7, 8. as having given gold to Śatānīka. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) vi. 7, 4, 2: dākṣāyaṇa-hasta, ‘goldenhande.’ Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 283, n. 2, seems unnecessarily doubtful as to this. the word is actually used to denote ‘gold.’ The Dākṣāyaṇas appear there 3) ii. 4, 4, 6. Cf. Artareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 40. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 224; 4, 358; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 195; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 35; Lévi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 138. as a race of princes who, because of performing a certain rite, prospered down to the time of the Brāhmaṇa itself.

daatyauha|दात्यौह
दात्यौह,<BR> a ‘gallinule,’ is mentioned in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 17, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 25. 39. Pāṇini, vii. 3. 1, derives the word from ditya-vah. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 91. The word is clearly a variant of dātyūha, which occurs in the epics and law books.

daatra|दात्र
दात्र<BR> (‘cutter’), denoting a ‘sickle,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 78, 10; Nirukta, ii. 1. Cows ‘with sickle-shaped marks on their ears’ (dātra-karṇyaḥ) are referred to in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā. 2) iv. 2, 9. Otherwise the expression is only found later, occurring in the Sūtra and epic literature. 3) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 86. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238. See also Sṛṇi.

daatreya|दात्रेय
दात्रेय<BR> is the patronymic of Arāḍa Śaunaka in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373. Possibly Dārteya, ‘descendant of Dṛti,’ should be read, 2) Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. but the word may have the same derivation as the latter form with metathesis.

daadhiicha|दाधीच
दाधीच,<BR> ‘descendant of Dadhyanc,’ is the patronymic of Cyavana in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 6).

daana|दान
1. Dāna, ‘giving,’ ‘gift,’ is a word of frequent occurrence in the Rigveda, especially in the Dāna-stutis 1) The term seems first to occur in the Bṛhaddevatā, vi. 45, 92, and in similar works. (‘Praises of Gifts’) of generous patrons (see Dakṣiṇā). One of the characteristics of the Brāhmaṇa is his right to receive gifts, which it is obligatory on the other castes to present. 2) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 7, 1; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 47-61. The gift of a daughter (kanyāyā dānam) was a form of marriage 3) Nirukta, iii. 4. (see Vivāha), because in it the girl was ‘given’ away by her father or brother.

daana|दान
2. Dāna (‘distribution’) 1) From dā, ‘divide.’ seems in several passages of the Rigveda 2) i. 55, 7; 48, 4; 180, 5; viii. 46, 26; 60, 8; 99, 4, etc. Cf., however, Pischel Vedische Studien, 1, 100. to be a designation of the sacrificial feast to which the god is invited (cf. ). In one passage 3) Rv. viii. 33, 8; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 157. Sāyaṇa thinks that it denotes the mada-jalāni, ‘drops of water falling from the temples of a rutting elephant,’ 4) Dāna in this sense, so common in the post-Vedic language, is probably derived from dā, ‘divide,’ meaning originally ‘secretion.’ but this is doubtful. In another passage 5) ii. 13, 7. Roth thinks that ‘pasture land’ is meant.

daana|दान
3. Dāna is in three passages of the Rigveda 1) v. 27, 5; vii. 18, 23; viii. 46, 24. But in all these cases ‘gifts’ seems an adequate version, ‘horses’ being understood. held by Roth to designate a chariot horse.

daaman|दामन्
दामन्,<BR> a ‘rope’ or ‘girdle,’ 1) Originally ‘bond,’ from dā, ‘bind.’ is often mentioned in the Rigveda and later. 2) Rv. i. 56, 3, etc.; Av. vi. 63, 1; 103, 2; vii. 103, 1. 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 13, 1, etc. Reference is made to the rope of the sacrificial horse, 3) Rv. i. 162, 8. as well as to the practice of tying calves with ropes. 4) Rv. ii. 28, 7. The word occurs in the sense of a ‘band’ of horse hair in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 5) v. 3, 1, 10. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 62, n. 2.

daaya|दाय
दाय<BR> occurs in the Rigveda 1) x. 114, 10. only in the sense of ‘reward’ of exertion (śrama), but later it means ‘inheritance’--that is, a father's property which is to be divided among his sons either during his lifetime or after his death. The passages all negative the idea that the property of the family was legally family property: it is clear that it was the property of the head of the house, usually the father, and that the other members of the family only had moral claims upon it which the father could ignore, though he might be coerced by his sons if they were physically stronger. Thus Manu is said in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 2) iii. 1, 9, 4 et seq. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 191-194; Lévi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 67, 68. to have divided his property among his sons. He omitted Nābhānediṣṭha, whom he afterwards taught how to appease the Aṅgirases, and to procure cows. This is a significant indication that the property he divided was movable property, rather than land (Urvarā). In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 3) v. 14. the division is said to have been made during Manu's lifetime by his sons, who left only their aged father to Nābhānediṣṭha. According to the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, 4) iii. 156 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 61, 62). again, four sons divided the inheritance while their old father, Abhipratārin, was still alive. It is, of course, possible to regard Dāya as denoting the heritable property of the family, but the developed patria potestas of the father, which was early very marked, as shown by the legend of Śunaḥśepa, is inconsistent with the view that the sons were legally owners with their father, unless and until. they actually insisted on a division of the property. 5) The same question has been raised as to the origin of English or Teutonic property in land generally. Against any idea even of family ownership in a strict sense of the word, see Fustel de Coulanges, Recherches sur quelques Problèmes d'Histoire, 322 et seq.; Ashley, in Fustel de Coulanges, Origin of Property in Land, xvi-xxi; Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law, 2, 237 et seq. The older view, which accepted family and communal ownership, represented in different forms by Maine (Village Communities in the East and West), Stubbs, Green, and others, is defended in a new form by Vinogradoff, Villanage in England. See also Keith, Journal of the African Society, 6, 201 et seq. Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 93-96, does not accept the communal ownership of land, but, ibid., 80, is inclined to believe in the joint ownership of a family. He admits that this is inconsistent with the strict rule of patria potestas, which still exists in Bengal; Baden Powell, Village Communities in India, 133 et seq., doubts the existence in early India of such a patria potestas. But the facts seem clearly to show that there was such a power, and that the father owned the property. His sons, as they grew up, came to claim the property, and he might have to divide it; hence the idea naturally developed that every child on birth had a legal share in the property. No doubt also from the first the right to part with land was one which grown-up sons and the rest of the community could object to, once the village had acquired a fixed existence. This would account adequately for the later system. Cf. also pp. 100, n. 19; 336, n. 7, and Rājanya. Probably-there is no evidence of any decisive character--land was not divided at first, but no doubt its disposal began to follow the analogy of cattle and other movable property as soon as the available supply of arable land became limited. As for the method of division, it is clear from the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 6) ii. 5, 2, 7. that the elder son was usually preferred; perhaps this was always the case after death. During the father's lifetime another might be preferred, as appears from a passage of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 7) xvi. 4, 4. Women were excluded from partition or inheritance, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 8) iv. 4, 2, 13. and the Nirukta. 9) iii. 4. They were, no doubt, supported by their brothers; but if they had none they might be reduced to prostitution. 10) Cf. Ztrī. Detailed rules of inheritance appear in the Sūtras. 11) Inheritance is also alluded to in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 17; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 27, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 2, 22; iii. 2, 1, 18. For the Sūtra rules, see Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 80 et seq. The heir is called Dayada, 12) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 4, 3, 9; Nirukta, iii. 4; metaphorically, Av. v. 18, 6, 14. ‘receiver (ā-da) of inheritance.’

daara|दार
दार,<BR> ‘wife,’ is found in the Sūtras (usually as a plural masculine), and once (as a singular) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) vi. 4, 12 (where dvāreṇa is a varia lectio; see St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.). Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 415, 416, who igneres the Bṛhadāraṇyaka passage.

daaru|दारु
दारु,<BR> ‘wood,’ is frequently mentioned in the Rigveda and later, 1) Rv. vi. 3, 4; x. 145, 4, etc.; Av. x. 4, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 8, 3, etc. denoting amongst other things the pole of a chariot, 2) Rv. x. 102, 8. logs as fuel, 3) Rv. viii. 102, 20. the wooden parts of a car, 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 6, 2, 14. possibly wooden stocks, 5) Av. vi. 121, 2. But this is doubtful. Cf. Tāya and Drupada. and so forth.

daarDhajayanti|दार्ढजयन्ति
दार्ढ-जयन्ति,<BR> ‘descendant of Dṛḍhajayanta,’ is the patronymic of Vaipaścita Gupta Lauhitya and of Vaipaścita Dṛḍhajayanta Lauhitya in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 42, 1).

daarteya|दार्तेय
दार्तेय,<BR> ‘descendant of Dṛti.’ The Dārteyas are mentioned as authorities on sacrificial matters in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 1) xxxi. 2 (Indische Studien, 3, 473). and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 2) xxv. 3, 6. 

daarbhya|दार्भ्य
दार्भ्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Darbha,’ is mentioned in a verse of the Rigveda. 1) v. 61, 17. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. identifies him with Śyāvāśva, but the Bṛhaddevatā 3) v. 50. 77. with Rathavīti. The same patronymic is frequently 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 2, 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 4, 12; 6, 5; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, vii. 4. Cf. Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 62, n. 2. connected with Keśin, and is also applied to Rathaprota. 5) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 3. See also Dālbhya.

daarvaaghaata|दार्वाघात
दार्व्-आघात,<BR> the ‘woodpecker,’ is included in the list of sacrificial victims at the Aśvamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 15, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 16; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 35. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 92.

daarvaahaara|दार्वाहार
दार्व्-आहार,<BR> a ‘gatherer of wood,’ is included in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘human sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyī Saṃhitā, xxx. 12; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 8, 1.

daalbhi|दाल्भि
दाल्भि,<BR> ‘descendant of Dalbha,’ is the patronymic of Vaka in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (x. 6).

daalbhya|दाल्भ्य
दाल्भ्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Dalbha,’ is a variant of Dārbhya. It is the patronymic of (a) Keśin in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa; 1) xiii. 10, 8. Cf. the Itihāsa, reported by Ṣaḍguruśiṣya (Sarvānukramaṇī, ed. Macdonell, 118). The St. Petersburg Dictionary quotes the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, vii. 4, for Dālbhya (but also for Dārbhya, which is the reading of Lindner's edition). (b) Caikitāyana in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 2) i. 8, 1. and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa; 3) i. 38, 1; 56, 3. (c) Vaka in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 4) i. 2, 13; 12, 1, 3. and the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 5) xxx. 2, where Dālbhya is read, not Dālbhi, as stated in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. The Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā, xlvi. 5, has Darbhasya. Dālbhi is found, however, in Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 6. 

daava|दाव
दाव,<BR> ‘forest fire,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) vii. 45, 2. and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 2) xi. 2, 7, 32. In the latter work such fires are referred to as occurring in spring. According to Sieg, 3) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 44 et seq. a hymn of the Rigveda 4) x. 142. Sieg's interpretation of this hymn is not at all probable. describes a forest fire. Watchers were employed to guard against surprise from such conflagrations (dāva-pa). 5) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 16; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 11, 1.

daavasuaangirasa|दावसुआङ्गिरस
दाव-सु आङ्गिरस,<BR> a seer of Sāmans, or chants, is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 5, 12, 14. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160.

daasha|दाश
दाश,<BR> ‘fisherman,’ is mentioned in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘human sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 16; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 12, 1. Weber, Indische Streifen 1, 81, renders the word by Fischerknecht, perhaps regarding it as equivalent to dāsa, ‘servant.’ Cf. Manu, x. 34; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Dāśa, 2. 3. Cf. Dhaivara.

daashataya|दाशतय
दाशतय,<BR> ‘belonging to the (Rigveda text) divided into ten (books),’ is an epithet of Adhyāya, ‘section,’ in the Nidāna Sūtra. 1) ii. 11 (Indische Studien, 1, 45) The feminine form of the word is also found in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 2) viii. 7. and later 3) Ṛgveda Prātiśākhya, xvi. 54; xvii. 30; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 2, 16, 22, etc.; Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxvi. 13; xxvii. 4, etc.

daasharaaJNa|दाशराज्ञ
दाश-राज्ञ<BR> is the name in the Rigveda 1) vii. 33, 2, 5; 83, 8. and the Atharvaveda 2) x. 128, 12. of Sudās' famous ‘battle with the ten kings.’ It is somewhat difficult to make out exactly who the kings were (see Turvaśa), but the number is probably a round one, and cannot be pressed. The actual battle hymn 3) 8, 18 does not contain the word, and the passages in which it is found may reasonably be considered late. 4) Cf. for the late date of vii. 33, Bergaigne, L'histoire de la Saṃhita, 38, 72; Oldenberg, Prolegomena, 198, 200, 265, n. 1; Arnold, Vedic Metre, 309; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 130, opposes this view, but not convincingly.

daasharma|दाशर्म
दाशर्म<BR> appears in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 1) vii. 6. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 472. as a teacher and a contemporary of Āruṇi.

daasa|दास
दास,<BR> like Dasyu, sometimes denotes enemies of a demoniac character in the Rigveda, 1) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 157. but in many passages 2) Cf. Rv. v. 34, 6; vi. 22, 10; 33, 3; 50, 6; vii. 83, 1; x. 38, 3; 69, 6; 3, 1; Av. v. 11, 3. the word refers to human foes of the Āryans. The Dāsas are described as having forts (puraḥ), 3) ii. 20, 8 (called āyasīḥ, ‘made of iron’); i. 103, 3; iii. 12, 6; iv. 32, 10. They are called śāradīḥ, ‘autumnal,’ in 1. 131, 4; 174, 2; vi. 20, 10. Cf. also dehyaḥ, ‘ramparts,’ in vi. 47, 2. and their clans (viśaḥ) are mentioned. 4) ii. 11, 4; iv. 28, 4; vi. 25, 2. It is possible that the forts, which are called ‘autumnal’ (śaradīḥ), 5) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 60. may be mythical, but it is not essential, for the epithet may allude to their being resorted to in the autumn season. The Dāsa colour (Varṇa) 6) ii. 12, 4; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 25, 6. Cf. Rv. i. 101, 1; 130, 8; ii. 20, 7; iv. 16, 13; vi. 47, 21; vii. 5, 3. The Ārya colour is mentioned in iii. 34, 9, and the Dāsa is contrasted with the Varṇa (of the singers) in i. 104, 2. The ‘white-hued (śvitnya) friends’ who, in i. 100, 18, aid in the conquest of the Dasyu and Siṃyu are doubtless Āryans. In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 30, the day and night (ahorātre) are paralleled with the Śūdrāryau--that is, probably with the Āryan and Śūdra (the compound is not to be taken as giving the words in the correct order; cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 268). See also Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 140; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 10, 11. is probably an allusion to the black skin of the aborigines, which is also directly mentioned. 7) kṛṣṇā tvac, ‘black skin,’ i. 130, 8; ix. 41, 1. The aborigines (as Dasyus) are called anās, ‘noseless’(?), 8) Cf. Dasyu, notes 6, 7. and mṛdhra-vāc, ‘of hostile speech,’ 9) v. 29, 10. See Dasyu; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 138. and are probably meant by the phallus-worshippers (śiśna-devāḥ, ‘whose deity is a phallus’) of the Rigveda. 10) vii. 21, 5; x. 99, 3. Cf. Macdonell, op. cit., p. 155. It is significant that constant reference is made to the differences in religion between Ārva and Dāsa or Dasyu. 11) Rv. i. 33, 4. 5; iv. 16, 9; v. 7, 10; 42, 9; vi. 14, 3; viii. 70, 10; x. 22, 7. 8, etc. Since the Dāsas were in many cases reduced to slavery, the word Dāsa has the sense of ‘slave’ in several passages of the Rigveda. 12) vii. 86, 7; viii. 56, 3; x. 62, 10. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 2, suggests that in viii. 46, 32, the word dāsān, ‘slaves,’ should be read in place of dāse, qualifying Balbūtha. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 117, quotes the passage to indicate the admixture of Āryan and Dāsa blood. See also Av. iv. 9, 8; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vii. 24, 2. It is uncertain whether dāsa-pravarga, as an epithet of rayi, ‘wealth,’ in Rv. i. 92, 8, means ‘consisting of troops of slaves.’ Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 82, so takes the expression in i. 158, 5. Dāsī, the feminine, always has this sense from the Atharvaveda 13) Av. v. 22, 6; xii. 3, 13; 4, 9; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 13, 2; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 10 (Mādhyaṃdina = 2, 7 Kāṇva). Zimmer, 107, sees this sense in vadhū in Rv. viii. 19, 36. See also Vadhūmant. onwards. Aboriginal women were, no doubt, the usual slaves, for on their husbands being slain in battle they would naturally have been taken as servants. They would sometimes also become concubines; thus Kavaṣa was taunted with being the son of a female slave (dāsyāḥ putraḥ) in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 14) ii. 19; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xii. 3. Ludwig 15) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 209. considers that in some passages 16) See i. 158, 5; ii. 13, 8; iv. 30, 14. 15; vi. 20, 10; vii. 99, 5; x. 49, 6, 7. None of these passages need certainly be so taken. Dāsa is applied, in the sense of ‘enemy,’ to Āryan foes, but this is uncertain. Zimmer 17) Altindisches Leben, 110 et seq. and Meyer 18) Geschichte des Altertums, 1, 515. think that Dāsa 19) If derived from das in the sense of ‘lay waste’ (Whitney, Roots), the original meaning would have been ‘devastator,’ ‘ravager.’ originally meant ‘enemy’ in general, later developing in Iran into the name of the Dahae 20) The Dahae may have been closely allied in race and language with the Iranians, but this is not very clearly proved. Cf. E. Kuhn in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 28, 214; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 95. The possibility or probability of mixture with Mongolian blood is always present. So Zimmer, op. cit., 112, calls the Daoi or Daai of Herodotus, i. 126, a Turanian tribe. of the Caspian steppes, and in India into a designation of the aborigines. On the other hand, Hillebrandt 21) Op. cit., 1, 94. argues that, as the Dāsas and the Paṇis are mentioned together, 22) Rv. v. 34, 6. 7; vii. 6, 3 (Dasyu and Paṇi together); Av. v. 11, 6. they must be deemed to be closely related tribes, identifying the Paṇis with the Parnians and the Dāsas of the Rigveda with the Dahae. This view, of course, necessitates a transfer of the scenes of the Rigveda, where Dāsas are prominent, and especially those in which Divodāsa--‘the heavenly Dāsa’--plays an important part, 23) Op. cit., 1, 96 et seq., He argues that Dāsa occurs only four times in Maṇḍala vii., but eight times in vi., and that similarly Śambara, the Dāsa, is mentioned six times in vi., but only twice in vii. But Divodāsa much more probably means, as Oldenberg interprets the name, ‘the servant of heaven.’ See his Religion des Veda, 155, n. 1; Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 2, 209; below, p. 363, n. 11. to the far west. Hillebrandt justifies this by regarding the scene of the sixth book of the Rigveda as quite different from that of the seventh and third, in which Sudās, the Bharatas, Vasiṣṭha, and Viśvāmitra appear. The Sarasvatī of the sixth book he locates in Arachosia, that of the seventh in the ‘Middle Country.’ It is, however, extremely doubtful whether this theory can be upheld. That Divodāsa should have been a Dāsa, and yet have fought against other Dāsas, is not in itself likely, especially when his son Sudās appears as a protagonist of Āryan civilization. It also seems unreasonable to seek in Arachosia for the river Sarasvati, which it is natural to locate in the ‘Middle Country.’ The wealth of the Dāsas was no doubt considerable, 24) Cf. Rv. i. 176, 4; iv. 30, 13; viii. 40, 6; x. 69. 5; Av. vii. 90, 2. but in civilization there is no reason to suppose that they were ever equal to the invaders. 25) Cf. Rv. ii. 12, 11; iv. 30. 14; vi. 26, 5, whence it appears that the Dāsas were often dwellers in mountains, a natural refuge for beaten tribes. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 269-275, 368; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 207-213; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 101-118; Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 35 (who derives dāsa from dā, ‘bind’), 254; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2, 359 et seq.; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 96. Leading Dāsas were Ilībiśa, Cumuri and Dhuni, Pipru, Varcin, Śambara. For names of aboriginal tribes, see Kirāta, Kīkaṭa, Caṇḍāla, Parṇaka, Śiṃyu.

daasavesha|दासवेश
दास-वेश,<BR> occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) ii. 13, 8. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 209. probably designates a Dāsa named Veśa. Sāyaṇa's interpretation of the word as ‘destruction of foes’ can hardly be correct. 

daasya|दास्य
दास्य<BR> occurs once in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (iv. 2. 30 Mādhyaṃdina = 23 Kāṇva) in the sense of ‘slavery.’

dityavaah|दित्यवाह्
दित्य-वाह्,<BR> m.; Dityauhī, f., ‘a two-year-old bull or cow.’ is mentioned in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmanas. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 3, 1; v. 6, 15, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 10; xviii. 26; xxviii. 25; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxi. 1, etc.

didyu|दिद्यु
दिद्यु, दिद्युत्,<BR> both 1) Didyu: i. 71, 5, iv. 41, 4; vii. 56, 9; 85, 2, etc.; Av. i. 2, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ii. 20; x. 17, etc. Didyut: Rv. i. 66, 7; v. 86, 3; vii. 25, 1, etc.; certainly divine in ii. 13, 7. denote in the Rigveda ‘missile,’ ‘arrow,’ whether divine or human.

didhiShu|दिधिषु
दिधिषु<BR> in the Rigveda denotes a ‘wooer.’ It is applied 1) x. 18, 18 = Av. xviii. 3, 2 (where didhiṣus is merely a bad reading) = Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, vi. 1, 3. to the relative, probably brother-in-law, 2) Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 2, 18, where are mentioned the brother-in-law (devṛ), a representative of the husband (there is nothing to show whether he is identical with the preceding or not), a pupil, or an aged servant (jarad-dāsa). who takes the place of the husband at the funeral rite, and who, as in the Hebraic levirate, is to beget a child by the brother's wife if there is no son. 3) Cf. Rv. x. 40, 2; Kaegi, Der Rigveda, n. 51. Hillebrandt 4) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 40, 708 et seq. and Lanman 5) Sanskrit Reader, 385. consider that the word originally meant only ‘wooer,’ and applied to the king who, after the chief queen had lain beside the dead victim in the Puruṣamedha or ‘human sacrifice,’ claimed her again; but this view is hardly plausible. 6) See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 848, 849; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 946. The term is also applied to the god Pūṣan 7) vi. 55, 5. as the wooer of his mother, apparently Sūryā. 8) Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 21; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 35. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 154.

didhiShuupati|दिधिषूपति
दिधिषू-पति<BR> occurs in the Kāṭhaka 1) xxxi. 7, quoted in Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 579. and Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitās, 2) xlvii. 7, quoted ibid., 579, 580. as well as in the Āpastamba, 3) ii. 5, 12, 22. Gautama, 4) xv. 16. and Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtras, 5) i. 18; xx. 7 et seq. in lists of people who have committed sin (enas). The traditional rendering 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. didhiṣu, 3. is ‘husband of a woman married a second time’; Manu 7) iii. 173. seems to apply the term to the brother-in-law who is ‘married’ to his sister-in-law after his brother's death for the purpose of begetting a child, if he displays conjugal affection to her (anurajyate kāmataḥ). 8) Cf. Leist, Altarisches Jus Gentium, 106. This sense would be possible, since Didhiṣu denotes a ‘wooer,’ and a widow could be regarded as a ‘wooer’ when able to control her own choice of a spouse. But another tradition 9) Laugākṣi, quoted by Kullūka on Manu, iii. 160; Commentary on Āpastamba, loc. cit. holds that Didhiṣū means the elder sister whose younger sister has married before her. This view is supported by a passage in the Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, 10) xx. 7 et seq. and by the use of the word agredidhiṣū-pati, 11) Cf. agre-didhiṣu, ‘one who woos (a younger sister) before (her elder sister is married),’ in Āpastamba, loc. cit.; Gautama, xv. 16; Vasiṣṭha, i. 18; Kāṭhaka, loc. cit.; agre-dadhus, Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 9; agre-dadhiṣu, Kapiṣṭhala, loc. cit.; agra-didhiṣu, Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 8, 11. which must mean the ‘husband of a younger sister married before the elder.’ In this case also Didhiṣū would mean ‘wooer,’ the elder sister being so called because, if her parents do not arrange a marriage for her, she is, according to Viṣṇu, 12) Viṣṇu Dharma Sūtra, xxiv. 40. Cf. Delbrück, op. cit., 579-586. to make her own choice of a husband (kuryāt svayaṃvaram). See also Edidhiṣuḥpati and Daidhiṣavya.

div|दिव्
दिव्,<BR> ‘sky.’ The world as a whole is regarded as divided into the three domains of ‘earth,’ ‘air’ or ‘atmosphere,’ and ‘heaven’ or ‘sky’ (div), 1) Rv. ii. 40; viii. 6, 15; 10, 6; 90, 6, etc. or alternatively into ‘heaven and earth’ (dyāvā-pṛthivī), 2) Rv. i. 143, 2; 159, 1; 160, 1; iv. 14, 2, etc.; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 8, 3, 9; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vii. 4, 2; viii. 1, 3. In the Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 1, 2, and the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, vii. 3, it is said that when heavy and constant rain falls people say. ‘Heaven and earth have united.’ which two are then considered as comprising the universe, the atmosphere being included in the sky. Lightning, wind, and rain belong to the atmosphere, solar and similar phenomena to the sky. In some passages 3) Av. iv. 14, 3 = Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvii. 67. the vault (nāka) of the sky is added after the usual triad, and before the celestial light (svar, jyotis). The threefold division of the universe is reflected in a threefold division of the three elements--earth, air, and sky. Thus a highest (uttama, 4) Rv. v. 60, 6. uttara, 5) Rv. iv. 26, 6. pārya 6) Rv. vi. 40, 5. In Rv. v. 4, 3, it is called tṛtīya. ), a middle, and a lowest heaven are specified. 4) Rv. v. 60, 6. In the Atharvaveda 7) xviii. 2, 48. the three heavens are distinguished as ‘rich in water’ (udanvatī), as pīlumatī (of uncertain meaning), and as the pradyaus, where the Fathers sit. Heaven is frequently called vyoman as well as rocana 8) Trīṇi or trī rocanā, Rv. i. 102, 8; 149, 4; v. 69, 1, etc. (properly the ‘luminous space’ of heaven), and the dividing firmament which separates the visible upper world from the highest heaven is called, besides nāka, ‘vault,’ sānu, ‘summit,’ viṣṭap, ‘surface,’ and pṛṣṭha, ‘ridge,’ and even ‘ridge of the vault,’ 9) Rv. i. 125, 5. Cf. iii. 2, 12. or ‘summit of the vault.’ 10) Rv. viii. 103, 2. Cf. also ix. 86, 27. Similarly three atmospheres (rajas), or oftener two, are alluded to, 11) Rv. iv. 53, 5; v. 69, 1. Cf. also the references to the ‘highest’ atmosphere, uttama, ix. 22, 5; parama, iii. 30, 2; tṛtīya, ix. 74, 6; x. 45, 3; 123, 8. The ‘lower’ (upara) or ‘terrestrial’ (pārthiva) is contrasted with the ‘heavenly’ (divya) space. See i. 62, 5; iv. 53, 3. but the division here is merely artificial. In one passage 12) Rv. i. 164, 6. Cf. vii. 87, 5. six rajāṃsi, ‘regions,’ are referred to, the heavens and the earths no doubt being meant. The usual name for the atmosphere is antarikṣa. The three earths are equally artificial, the origin of the triad being probably the use of pṛthivī in the plural 13) Rv. i. 188, 9. 10; vii. 104, 11. to denote the three divisions of the universe (just as pitarau, ‘two fathers,’ denotes ‘father and mother’). 14) Cf. Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 98; Macdonell, Sanskrit Grammar, 183c (p. 158). The earth is called kṣam, kṣā, gmā, or designated by the epithets mahī, ‘the great,’ pṛthivī or urvī, ‘the broad,’ uttānā, ‘the extended,’ and is regularly contrasted as idam, ‘this world here,’ with the upper sphere. 15) Rv. i. 22, 17; 154, 1. 3; and regularly in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. The shape of the earth is compared with a wheel in the Rigveda, 16) x. 89, 4. On the other hand, the earth is regarded as catur-bhṛṣṭi, ‘four-cornered,’ in Rv. x. 58, 3. and is expressly called ‘circular’ (pari-maṇḍala) in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 17) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 9. When earth is conjoined with heaven, the two are conceived as great bowls (camvā) turned towards each other. 18) Rv. iii. 55, 20. In the Aitareya Āraṇyaka 19) iii. 1, 2; Śāṅkhāvana Āraṇyaka, vii. 3. the two are regarded as halves of an egg. The distance of heaven from the earth is given by the Atharvaveda 20) x. 8, 18 = xiii. 2, 38; 3, 14. as a thousand days' journey for the sun-bird, by the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 21) ii. 17. Cf. Āśvina. as a thousand days' journey for a horse, while the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 22) xvi. 8, 6; in xxi. 1, 9, with the alternatives of 1,000 days of the journey of a horse, or of the sun, or 1,000 leagues. whimsically estimates the distance as equivalent to a thousand cows standing one on the top of the other. According to Zimmer, 23) Altindisches Leben, 357, 358. the Vedic poets conceived the atmosphere to be above the earth in its upper division only, but below it in its lower stratum. The evidence, 24) Rv. v. 81, 4; vi. 9, 1; vii. 80, 1. however, for the latter assumption is quite insufficient. 25) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 10. The theory of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 26) iii. 44, 4. Speyer's interpretation of this passage, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1906, 723-727, is anticipated and supplemented by Macdonell, loc. cit. is that the sun merely reverses its bright side at night, turning its light on the stars and the moon while it retraverses its course to the east; and it has been shown 25) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 10. that this is probably the doctrine of the Rigveda also. 27) i. 115, 5; x. 37, 3. literature. The Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa See also Sūrya and Candramās. For the Vedic knowledge of the planets, see Graha. There is no geographical division of the earth in Vedic literature.

Bergaigne, Religion Vedique, 1, 1-3; Wallis, Cosmology of the Rigveda, 111-117; Zimmer, op. cit., 357-359; Macdonell, op. cit., pp. 8-11; Thibaut. Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 5, 6; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 358-364. states that the centre of the earth is a span north of the Plakṣa Prāsravaṇā, and that the centre of the sky is the constellation of the seven Ṛṣis, the Great Bear. For the quarters, see Diś. 

divodaasaatithigva|दिवोदासअतिथिग्व
दिवोदास अतिथिग्व<BR> is one of the leading princes of the early Vedic age. He was a son of Vadhryaśva, 1) Rv. vi. 61, 1. and father, or more probably grandfather, of Sudās, the famous king of the Tṛtsu family, among the Bharatas. Probably Pijavana was the son and Sudās the grandson. Divodāsa was naturally a Bharata, 2) Rv. vi. 16, 4, 5, 19. For Sudās as his descendant, see vii. 18, 25, with verse 23, where Paijavana is an epithet of Sudās. and, like Sudās, was an opponent of the Turvaśas and Yadus. 3) As Atithigva, Rv. vii. 19, 8; as Divodāsa, ix. 61, 2. His great enemy was Śambara, the Dāsa, who was apparently chief of a mountain people, 4) Rv. i. 130, 7; ii. 12, 11; vi. 26, 5; vii. 18, 20. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 161. and whom he repeatedly defeated. 5) See Rv. i. 112, 14; 116, 18; 119, 4; 130, 7-10; ii. 19, 6; iv. 26, 3; 30, 20; vi. 26, 3. 5; 43, 1; 47, 21. 22; ix. 61, 2. He was also, it seems, like his father Vadhryaśva, 6) Rv. x. 69, 1 et seq. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 176; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologic, 1, 96, n. 2. an energetic supporter of the fire ritual, for Agni is once called by his name in the Rigveda. 7) Daivodāsa, ‘worshipped by Divodāsa’; viii. 103, 2. Cf. vi. 16, 5. 19; 31, 1. For the defeat by Indra, cf. Rv. i. 53, 10; ii. 14, 7; vi. 18, 13; viii. 64, 2; Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 2, 337, 344. On the other hand, he was defeated, with Āyu and Kutsa, by Indra's aid. In several passages he seems closely connected with the singer family, the Bharadvājas. 8) Cf. Rv. i. 112, 13, 14; 116, 18; vi. 16, 5; 31, 4; 47, 22 et seq.; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xv. 3, 7; Hillebrandt, op. cit., 1, 104. From one passage, 9) vi. 61, 1 et seq. where Divodāsa is said to have fought against the Paṇis, the Pārāvatas, and Bṛsaya, Hillebrandt 10) Op. cit., 1, 97 et seq. has inferred that he was engaged in conflicts with the tribes of Arachosia, and interpreting the name as the ‘heavenly Dāsa’ 11) This is very improbable. See Bergaigne, op. cit., 2, 209; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 155; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 49, 175; 51, 272. conjectures that he was himself a Dāsa. This conclusion is not probable, for the Sarasvatī on which the battle in question took place, and which can hardly be the Haraqaiti of Arachosia, would naturally designate the later Sarasvatī, while the Pārāvatas are mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 12) ix. 4, 11. See Pārāvata. as in the east, about the Yamunā. Bergaigne's opinion 13) Op. cit., 2, 342 et seq. that Divodāsa and Atithigva were different people cannot be supported in view of the complete parallelism in the acts of the two persons. 14) Compare, e.g., vii. 19, 8, with ix. 61, 2 (opposed to Turvaśa and Yadu); i. 51, 6; vi. 26, 3, with ii. 19, 6; vi. 31, 4 (defeat of Śambara); and see Hillebrandt, op. cit., 3, 268; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 210 et seq.; Macdonell, op. cit., p. 161. See also Pratardana. The people of Divodāsa are referred to in a hymn of the Rigveda. 15) i. 130, 10 (one of the series attributed to Parucchepa). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 126; Oldenberg, Buddha, 406; Ludwig, op. cit., 3, 114, 176; Grierson, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 604, 837; Keith, ibid., 831 et seq.; 1138 et seq. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., distinguishes two Divodāsas, one being the ancestor or father of Sudās, the other the enemy of Śambara. Divodāsa is not mentioned in Maṇḍalas, iii, v. viii, x.

divodaasabhaimaseni|दिवोदासभैमसेनि
दिवो-दास भैम-सेनि<BR> (‘descendant of Bhīmasena’) is mentioned in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 1) vii. 1, 8. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 472. as a contemporary of Āruṇi.

divya|दिव्य
दिव्य,<BR> ‘ordeal,’ is a term not found until the later literature, but several references to the practice of ordeals have been seen in Vedic literature. The fire ordeal seen in the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 12. by Schlagintweit, 2) Die Gottesurtheile der Indier, 13 et seq. Weber, 3) Indische Studien, 13, 168. Ludwig, 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 445. Zimmer, 5) Altindisches Leben, 184. and others, has been disproved by Grill, 6) Hundert Lieder,^2 45, 87. Bloomfield, 7) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, ccxxi; American Journal of Philology, 11, 334, 335; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 294. and Whitney. 8) Translation of the Atharvaveda. 54. But such an ordeal appears in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 9) xiv. 6, 6. and an ordeal with a glowing axe 10) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 16. occurs in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad as applied in an accusation of theft. Geldner 11) Vedische Studien, 2, 150. suggests that this usage is referred to even in the Rigveda, 12) iii. 53, 22. but this is most improbable. 13) Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 254. Ludwig 14) Op. cit., 4, 44. and Griffith 15) Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 210. discover in another passage of the Rigveda 16) i. 158, 4 et seq. references to Dīrghatamas' having been subjected to the fire and water ordeals, but this view cannot be supported. According to Weber, 17) Indische Streifen, 1, 21; 2, 363. the ‘balance’ ordeal is referred to in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 18) xi. 2, 7, 33. Cf. Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 145; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 44, 347, 348; Stenzler, ibid., 9, 669 et seq. but see Tulā.

divyashvan|दिव्यश्वन्
दिव्य श्वन्,<BR> the ‘divine dog,’ in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 80, 1. appears to denote Canis major or Sirius. But Bloomfield 2) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 163; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 500, 501. thinks that the two divine dogs referred to in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 3) i. 6, 9. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 4) i. 1, 2, 4-6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 353; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 341. are the sun and moon, and that the sun is meant in the Atharvaveda.

dish|दिश्
दिश्,<BR> ‘direction,’ is a word very frequently used in the Rigveda and later 1) Rv. i. 124, 3; 183, 5; iii. 30, 12; Av. iii. 31, 4; xi. 2, 12, etc. to denote a quarter of the sky. As a general rule, four quarters are mentioned--east, south, west, north. 2) Rv. vii. 72, 5; x. 36, 14; 42, 11; Av. xv. 2, 1 et seq., etc. But the number of the ‘directions’ is sometimes increased up to ten by the addition to these four of various others. The five points include the zenith (ūrdhvā); 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 15; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 8, 9. the six, the zenith and the nadir (ūrdhvā and avācī); 4) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 12, 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 24; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 2, 4. the seven, the zenith, the ground on which one stands (dhruvā), and the air (antarikṣa) between these two (vyadhvā); 5) Rv. ix. 114, 3; Av. iv. 40, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 4, 1, 20; ix. 5, 2, 8; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, i. 7. the eight include the intermediate quarters (S.E., S.W., N.E., N.W.); 6) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 15; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 1, 40, etc. the nine add to these the zenith; 7) Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 28, 2. the ten, zenith and nadir. 8) Rv. i. 164, 14; viii. 101, 13; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 2, 2, 34; viii. 4, 2, 13, etc. The number five is sometimes made up by the ground beneath the observer's feet (dhruvā), 9) Av. viii. 9, 15; xiii. 3, 6; xv. 14, 1-5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ix. 32; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ix. 4, 3, 10, and cf. Dhruvā. and the number six by that point (dhruvā) and the zenith (ūrdhvā); 10) Av. iii. 27, 1; iv. 14, 8; xii. 3, 55; xv. 4, 1 et seq.; xviii. 3, 34; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 14, etc. Cf. Rv. x. 14, 16. the ‘lofty’ (bṛhatī) 11) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 13, Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 8. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 359; Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1895, 846; Indische Studien, 17, 293. 294; 18, 153; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. sometimes taking the place of the ‘vertical’ (ūrdhvā).

diirghatamas|दीर्घतमस्
दीर्घ-तमस्<BR> (‘long darkness’) Māmateya (‘son of Mamatā’) Aucathya (‘son of Ucatha’) is mentioned as a singer in one hymn of the Rigveda, 1) i. 158, 1. 6. and is referred to in several passages 2) i. 147, 3; 152, 6; iv. 4, 13. In viii. 9, 10, Dīrghatamas is mentioned with Kakṣīvant, but not as a relative. by his metronymic, Māmateya, alone. He is said, both in the Rigveda 1) i. 158, 1. 6. and in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 3) ii. 17; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaha, 14. to have attained the tenth decade of life. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 4) viii. 23. he appears as the priest of Bharata. The Bṛhaddevatā 5) iv. 11-15; 21-25, with Macdonell's notes. contains a preposterous legend made up of fragments of the Rigveda, 6) From i. 140-164, which hymns are traditionally attributed to Dīrghatamas. But see Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischn Gesellschaft, 42, 221. according to which Dīrghatamas was born blind, but recovered his sight; in old age he was thrown into a river by his servants, one of whom, Traitana, attacked him, but killed himself instead. Carried down by the stream, he was cast up in the Aṅga country, where he married Uśij, a slave girl, and begot Kakṣīvant. The two legends here combined are not even consistent, for the second ignores Dīrghatamas' recovery of sight. To attach any historical importance to them, as does Pargiter, 7) Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society. 1910, 44. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig veda, 3, 164, 165; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 226, 232, 247, 268, 279. would seem to be unwise. 

diirghaniitha|दीर्घनीथ
दीर्घ-नीथ<BR> appears to be the proper name of a sacrificer in one hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 50, 10. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Ludwig understands the word as an adjective, meaning ‘of long duration.’

diirghashravas|दीर्घश्रवस्
दीर्घ-श्रवस्<BR> (‘far-famed’) is the name of a royal seer who, according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 1) xv. 3, 25. having been banished from his kingdom, and suffering from actual hunger, ‘saw’ a certain Sāman (chant), and thus obtained food. In one passage of the Rigveda 2) i. 112, 11. an Auśija, 3) A metronymic, ‘descendant of Uśij,’ according to Sāyaṇa; but an adjective, meaning ‘desirous,’ according to Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. a merchant (vaṇij), is mentioned as dīrgha-śravas, which may be a proper name, as Sāyaṇa holds, or an adjective, as it is understood by Roth. 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 114.

diirghaapsas|दीर्घाप्सस्
दीर्घाप्सस्,<BR> used in the Rigveda 1) i. 122, 15. as an epithet of a chariot, means, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 312. ‘having a long front part.’

diirghaayutva|दीर्घायुत्व
दीर्घायुत्व,<BR> ‘longevity,’ is a constant object of the prayers of the Vedic Indians, 1) Rv. x. 62, 2; Av. i. 22, 2, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 9, 1, 13, etc. So the adjective dīrghāyus, Rv. iv. 15, 9. 10; x. 85, 39; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xii. 100, etc. The Brāhmaṇas regularly express the reward for ritual actions by the phrase sarvam āyur eti, ‘he lives all his days.’ The ideal of life is 100 years. See Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 193; Festgruss an Roth, 137; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 384. and length of life is never deprecated in the Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas, while the Atharvaveda 2) ii. 13; 28; 29; vii. 32, and many other hymns. See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 49 et seq.; Atharvaveda, 63-65. is full of spells intended to prolong existence (āyuṣyāṇi).

diirghaaraNya|दीर्घारण्य
दीर्घारण्य,<BR> ‘wide tract of forest,’ in the Aitareya 1) iii. 44; vi. 23. and Śatapatha 2) xiii. 3, 7, 10. Brāhmanas refers to the extensive jungles which must clearly then have covered Northern India. In one of the Aitareya passages 3) iii. 44. it is said that in the east the villages are close together and frequent, while in the west there are forests.

diiv|दीव्
दीव्<BR> (fem.) in the Rigveda 1) x. 27, 17. and the Atharvaveda 2) vii. 50, 9; 109, 5. denotes the ‘game of dice.’ See Akṣa.

dughaa|दुघा
दुघा,<BR> ‘yielding milk,’ denotes ‘cow’ in a few passages in the Saṃhitās. 1) Rv. viii. 50, 3; x. 67, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxviii. 16, 39, etc.

dundubhi|दुन्दुभि
दुन्दुभि,<BR> apparently an onomatopoetic word, means ‘drum,’ as used in both war and peace. It is often mentioned from the Rigveda 1) i. 28, 5; vi. 47, 29. 31. onwards. 2) Av. v. 20, 1 et seq.; 21, 7; 31, 7; vi. 38, 4; xii. 1, 41; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 6, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 5, 6; dundubhya, ‘connected with the drum,’ Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 35. A special sort of drum was the ‘earth drum,’ made by digging a hole in the ground and covering it with a hide. This was employed in the Mahāvrata, a rite performed at the winter solstice, for the purpose of driving away influences hostile to the return of the sun. 3) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 5 (Indische Studien, 3, 477); Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvii. 14, 11; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v. 1, 5, with Keith's notes; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 148, n. 2; Friedlaender, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 29, 45. A ‘drumbeater’ is included in the list of sacrificial victims at the Puruṣamedha or ‘human sacrifice.’ 4) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 13, 1 (not in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā). Cf. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 4, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 289; and for the epic drum in battle, Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 318.

dur|दुर्
दुर्<BR> is used several times in the Rigveda 1) i. 68, 10; 113, 4; 121, 4; 188, 5; ii. 2, 7, etc. to denote ‘door,’ both literally and metaphorically. 

duroNa|दुरोण
दुरोण<BR> is used in the Rigveda, 1) iii. 1, 18; 25, 5; iv. 13, 1; v. 76, 4, etc. and sometimes later, 2) Av. vii. 17, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxiii. 71, etc. to denote ‘home,’ both literally and metaphorically. See Gṛha.

durga|दुर्ग
दुर्-ग,<BR> ‘hard to approach,’ occurs in the Rigveda as a neuter substantive only, sometimes in the sense of ‘fort,’ ‘stronghold.’ 1) v. 34, 7; vii. 25, 2. Cf. Pur.

durgaha|दुर्गह
दुर्-गह<BR> is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 65, 12. where his grandsons are lauded for their generosity, though Sāyaṇa renders the word adjectivally. 2) ‘Plunged in distress’ (duḥkhaṃ gāhamāna). In another passage of the Rigveda, 3) iv. 42, 8. however, Sāyaṇa sees in the epithet Daurgaha a description of Purukutsa as Durgaha's son, who was either captured by the enemy or slain, and whose wife, Purukutsānī, then obtained a son, Trasadasyu, to restore the line; he also quotes a story, not found in the Bṛhaddevatā, 4) As Roth. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., says it is. to support this interpretation. On the other hand, the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5) xiii. 5, 4, 5. According to the Naighaṇṭuka (i. 14), Daurgaha is a synonym of ‘horse.’ seems to take Daurgaha as meaning a horse. Sieg 6) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 96-102. thinks that the same sense should be adopted in the Rigveda passage, which he interprets as referring to the sacrifice of a horse, Daurgaha, by King Purukutsa to gain a son; he also sees in Dadhikrāvan, with Pischel 7) Vedische Studien, 1, 124. and Ludwig, 8) Translation of the Rigveda, 4, 79. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 71. a real horse, the charger of Trasadasyu. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa's interpretation of Daurgaha is, however, doubtful, and cannot be regarded as receiving support from the case of Dadhikrāvan, who was probably a divinity, and not a real horse at all. 9) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 148, 149. Cf. Ludwig, op. cit., 3, 163, 174; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 301, 302. 

durNaaman|दुर्णामन्
दुर्-णामन्,<BR> ‘of evil name,’ is the designation in the Rigveda 1) x. 162, 2. and the Atharvaveda 2) ii. 25, 2; viii. 6, 1 et seq.; xvi. 6, 7; xix. 36, 1 et seq. So also the feminine Durṇāmnī, iv. 17, 5; xix. 36, 6. of a demon causing disease, or the disease itself. The Nirukta 3) vi. 12. explains the words as meaning a ‘worm,’ an interpretation which accords with the widespread belief in disease-causing worms. 4) Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 61; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 314 et seq., 351. Later Durnāman denotes ‘hæmorrhoids.’ 5) Suśruta, 1, 177, 10, etc.

durmukha|दुर्मुख
दुर्-मुख,<BR> ‘ugly-faced,’ is the name, in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 1) viii. 23. The reading may be a-rājā, ‘not a king,’ but this is not necessary. of a Pāñcāla, that is, Pañcāla king, who conquered the world, and whose priest was Bṛhaduktha.

durya|दुर्य
दुर्य,<BR> ‘belonging to the door or house,’ appears in several passages of the Saṃhitās 1) Masculine plural, Rv. i. 91, 19; x. 40, 12; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 3, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 11; feminine plural, Rv. iv. 1, 9. 18; 2, 12; vii. 1, 11. as a plural substantive denoting the ‘door-posts,’ or more generally ‘dwelling.’

duryoNa|दुर्योण
दुर्योण<BR> occurs a few times in the Rigveda 1) i. 174, 7; v. 29, 10; 32, 8. in the sense of ‘house.’

durvaraaha|दुर्वराह
दुर्-वराह<BR> probably denotes a ‘wild boar.’ It is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xii. 4, 1, 4. and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 2) i. 51, 4 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 23, 332).

dulaa|दुला
दुला<BR> See Nakṣatra (Kṛttikās).

dushcharman|दुश्चर्मन्
दुश्-चर्मन्,<BR> ‘afflicted with a skin disease,’ occurs in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) ii. 1, 4, 3; 5, 1, 7. and Brāhmaṇa. 2) i. 7, 8, 3. The disease meant is probably leprosy, the usual name of which is Kilāsa. 3) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 3, 17; xxiii. 16, 11; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka v. 4, 12. 

duHshaasu|दुःशासु
दुः-शासु<BR> is possibly a proper name in the Rigveda, 1) x. 33, 1. and would then denote an enemy of Kuruśravaṇa. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165. thinks that he was a Parśu or Persian, but this is most improbable, and the word may simply be an adjective meaning ‘malignant.’

duHshiima|दुःशीम
दुः-शीम<BR> is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) x. 93, 14. as a generous donor, his patronymic perhaps being Tānva. 2) x. 93, 15. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166.

duShTariitu|दुष्टरीतु
दुष्-टरीतु,<BR> ‘hard to defeat,’ is the name of a king of the Sṛñjayas, who was deposed from a principality that had existed for ten generations, but was re-instated by Cākra Sthapati in spite of the resistance of Balhika Prātipīya, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) xii. 9, 3, 1 et seq. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 205-207.

duHShanta|दुःषन्त
दुः-षन्त<BR> See Dauḥṣanti.

duhitR|दुहितृ
दुहितृ<BR> is the regular designation of ‘daughter’ from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. viii. 101, 15; x. 17, 1; 40, 5; 61, 5, 7; Av. ii. 14, 2; vi. 100, 3; vii. 12, 1; x. 1, 25; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 4, 1; 8, 1, 8, etc. The word appears to be derived from duh, ‘milk,’ in the sense of one who nourishes a child, rather than as the ‘milker’ of the primitive family or the suckling. 2) Delbrück, Dic indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 454. See also Strī, Pati, Pitṛ, Bhrātṛ.

duuta|दूत
दूत,<BR> ‘messenger’ or envoy,' is found several times in the Rigveda 1) iii. 3, 2; vi. 8, 4; vii. 3, 3; x. 14, 12. and later, 2) Av. viii. 8, 10, etc.; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 1, 6; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, ii. 1, etc. The feminine form Dūtī is found in Rv. x. 108, 2, 3, in the story of Saramā's mission to the Paṇis. Dūtya, ‘mission,’ occurs in Rv. 1, 12, 4; 161, 1; iv. 7, 8; 8, 4, etc. used metaphorically. The Sūta seems to have performed the duties later assigned to the Dūta. 

duurvaa|दूर्वा
दूर्वा,<BR> a species of grass (Panicum dactylon), is mentioned frequently from the Rigveda 1) x. 16, 13; 134, 5; 142, 8. onwards. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 9, 2; v. 2, 8, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 20; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5. 8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5, 10, 5; vii. 4, 2, 10, 12, etc. It grew in damp ground. 3) Rv. x. 16, 13; 142, 8. A simile occurring in the Rigveda 4) x. 134, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70. seems to indicate that the ears lay horizontal with the stem. Cf. Pākadūrvā.

duursha|दूर्श
दूर्श,<BR> denoting some kind of garment, is mentioned twice in the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 7, 6; viii. 6, 11. Weber 2) Indische Studien, 18, 29. thinks that it was worn by the aborigines.

duuShiikaa|दूषीका
दूषीका,<BR> ‘rheum of the eyes,’ is mentioned as a disease in the Atharvaveda 1) xvi. 6, 8. and later. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 12; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxv. 9; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 3, 10.

dRDhachyutaagasti|दृढच्युतागस्ति
दृढ-च्युत् आगस्ति<BR> (‘descendant of Agastya’) is mentioned in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa 1) iii. 233 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 38).

dRti|दृति
1. Dṛti, a ‘leather bag to hold fluids,’ is frequently mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 191, 10; iv. 51, 1, 3; v. 83, 7; vi. 48, 18; 103, 2; viii. 5, 19; 9, 18. and later. 2) Av. vii. 18, 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 19, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxvi. 18, 19; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 3, 4; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 10, 2, etc. In one passage 3) Rv. vii. 89, 2. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 20, 30. it is called dhmāta, ‘inflated,’ the man afflicted with dropsy being compared with such a bag. Milk (Kṣīra) and intoxicating liquor (Surā) are mentioned as kept in bags. 4) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 11, 26; xvi. 13, 13. 

dRtiaindrota|दृतिऐन्द्रोत
2. Dṛti Aindrota (‘descendant of Indrota’) is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇā 1) xiv. 1, 12. 15. as a contemporary of Abhipratārin Kākṣaseni and as a pupil of Indrota Daivāpa in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Jaīminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 2) iii. 40, 2. Possibly the same Dṛti is meant in the compound Dṛti-Vātavantau, which is found in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 3) xxv. 3, 6. So a Sattra of a year's duration is later called Dṛti-vātavator ayana, Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxiv. 4, 16; 6, 25; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 3; Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xiii. 23, 1; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 10, 7. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 52, 53. The former is here said to have continued, after the Mahāvrata was over, the sacrificial session in which both had been engaged, with the result that his descendants prospered more than the Vātavatas.

dRptabaalaakigaargya|दृप्तबालाकिगार्ग्य
दृप्त-बालाकि गार्ग्य<BR> (‘descendant of Garga’) is the name of a teacher who is mentioned in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (ii. 1, 1) as a contemporary of Ajātaśatru of Kāśi.

dRbhiika|दृभीक
दृभीक<BR> is the name of a man 1) Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 152, 207, who compares the Derbikes; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 162. or a demon, 2) Grassmann, Wörterbuch, s.v.; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 85. who, according to the Rigveda, 3) ii. 14, 3. was slain by Indra.

dRShad|दृषद्
दृषद्<BR> appears in the Rigveda 1) vii. 104, 22; viii. 72, 4. and Atharvaveda 2) ii. 31, 1; v. 23, 8. to denote not a millstone, 3) Roth. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 269. but merely a stone used to pound grain, which was placed on another stone as a support. When used later 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 8, 3; 9, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 1, 22; ii. 6, 1, 9, etc. in connexion with Upalā, the lower and the upper millstone, or mortar and pestle may be meant; but this is not certain. Eggeling 5) Sacred Books of the East, 12, 11 (dṛṣad-upale, which are here distinguished from ‘mortar and pestle,’ ulūkhala-musale). Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 108, 109. renders them as the large and small millstones. See also Upara and Upalā.

dRShadvatii|दृषद्वती
दृषद्वती,<BR> ‘stony,’ is the name of a river which flows into the Sarasvatī after running for a time parallel to it. It is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) iii. 23, 4. along with the Sarasvatī and the Āpayā, as the scene of action of the Bharata princes. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 2) xxv. 10, 13. and later 3) Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, xxiv. 6, 6, 38; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 19, 4. the Dṛṣadvatī and the Sarasvatī are the scene of special sacrifices. In Manu 4) ii. 17. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 18; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 34; Indian Literature, 67, 102; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 87. these two rivers form the western boundary of the Middle Country.

dRShTa|दृष्ट
दृष्ट<BR> See Adṛṣṭa.

devakamaanyamaana|देवकमान्यमान
देवक मान्यमान<BR> (‘descendant of Manyamāna’) appears in the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 20 (devakaṃ cin mānyamānam). as an opponent of the Tṛtsus, and as connected with Śambara. Possibly, however, as Grassmann suggests, the words should be understood as denoting Śambara, ‘who deemed himself a god,’ devaka being used contemptuously. 2) Cf. Rv. ii. 11. 2 (amartyaṃ cid dāsam manyamānam). Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173.

devakiiputra|देवकीपुत्र
देवकी-पुत्र,<BR> ‘son of Devakī,’ is the metronymic of Kṛṣṇa in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 1) iii. 17, 6. According to the Epic, 2) Mahābhārata, i. 4480; v. 80, etc. a Devaka was father of Devakī, Kṛṣṇa's mother; the St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests that he was the ‘king of the Gandharvas’, also referred to in the Epic. 3) Ibid., i. 2704. 

devajanavidyaa|देवजनविद्या
देव-जन-विद्या,<BR> ‘knowledge of divine beings,’ is one of the sciences enumerated in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 4, 3, 10. Cf. x. 5, 2, 20. and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 2) vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1.

devatarasshyaavasaayanakaashyapa|देवतरस्श्यावसायनकाश्यप
देव-तरस् श्यावसायन काश्यप<BR> (‘descendant of Kaśyapa’) is mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 1) iii. 40, 2. as a pupil of Rsyasṛṅga. In the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 2) Indische Studien, 4, 373. as Śāvasāyana, he is a pupil of his father Śavas, who again was a pupil of Kāśyapa.

devatyaa|देवत्या
देवत्या<BR> occurs in the text of the Atharvaveda, 1) i. 22, 3. where it must, if the reading is correct, denote some animal. 2) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. But the reading should no doubt be rohiṇī-devatyās, ‘having the red one as deity.’ 3) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 23.

devana|देवन
देवन<BR> is mentioned once in the Rigveda 1) x. 43, 5. in connexion with dicing. The word must designate the place on which the dice are thrown (elsewhere called Adhidevana), and it is so explained by Durga in his commentary on the Nirukta. 2) v. 22. Cf. Lüders, Das Würfelspiel im alten Indien, 14.

devanaxatra|देवनक्षत्र
देव-नक्षत्र,<BR> ‘asterism of the gods,’ is the name applied in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 1) i. 5, 2, 6, 7. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 309, 310. to the first fourteen lunar mansions, which are said to be south, while the others are called Yamanakṣatra, ‘asterisms of Yama,’ and are said to be north. See Nakṣatra.

devabhaagashrautarSha|देवभागश्रौतर्ष
देव-भाग श्रौतर्ष<BR> is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) ii. 4, 4, 5. This passage is misquoted by Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 81, 3. See Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 9. n.; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 152. as the Purohita, or ‘domestic priest,’ of both the Sṛñjayas and the Kurus. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 2) vii. x. he is said to have taught Girija Bābhravya the science of the dissection of the sacrificial animal (pasor vibhakti). In the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 3) iii. 10, 9, 11. he is an authority on the Sāvitra Agni.

देव-मलिम्लुच्,<BR> ‘robber of the gods,’ is the epithet of Rahasya, 1) Or Rahasyu. who is said in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 2) xiv. 4, 7. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 51, 52. to have slain the pious Vaikhānasas at Munimaraṇa (‘saint's death’). He was apparently an Asura, but may have been a real person.

devamuni|देवमुनि
देव-मुनि,<BR> ‘divine saint,’ is the epithet of Tura in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xxv. 14, 5). The name is given in the Anukramaṇī to the author of a hymn of the Rigveda (x. 146).

देव-राजन्<BR> apparently denotes a king of Brahminical descent in the phrase ‘Sāmans of Devarājans’ in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xviii. 10, 5). Cf. Rājanyarṣi and Varṇa.

devaraata|देवरात
देव-रात<BR> (‘god-given’) Vaiśvāmitra (‘descendant of Viśvāmitra’) is the name given to Śunaḥśepa after his adoption by Viśvāmitra in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 1) vii. 17. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 27.

devala|देवल
देवल<BR> is mentioned as a Ṛṣi in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (xxii. 11). See also Daivala.

devavant|devavat|देववत्|देववन्त्
देववन्त्<BR> is mentioned in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 22. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 171; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 138. as the ancestor of Sudās, apparently his grandfather; or if Pijavana be accepted as Sudās' father, and Divodāsa as his grandfather, then his great-great-grandfather, and father of Vadhryaśva. The succession in the latter case would then be Devavant, Vadhryaśva, Divodāsa, Pijavana, Sudās. 

devavaata|देववात
देव-वात<BR> (‘desired of the gods’) is the name of a Bharata prince in the Rigveda, 1) iii. 23, 2. Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 409; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 218. where he is mentioned as sacrificing on the Dṛṣadvatī, Sarasvatī, and Āpayā.

देव-विद्या,<BR> ‘knowledge of the gods,’ is one of the sciences enumerated in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (vii. 1, 2, 4; 2, 1; 7, 1).

devashravas|देवश्रवस्
देव-श्रवस्<BR> is the name of a Bharata prince who with Devavāta appears as a sacrificer on the Dṛṣadvatī, Sarasvatī, and Āpayā in the Rigveda. 1) iii. 23, 2. 3. In the Anukramaṇī he is called a son of Yama, and has a hymn, x. 17, ascribed to him.

devaatithikaaNva|देवातिथिकाण्व
देवातिथि काण्व<BR> (‘descendant of Kaṇva’) is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) ix. 2, 19. as the seer of a Sāman (chant) by which he turned pumpkins into cows for himself and his son when they were starving in the desert, whither they had been driven by rivals. He is also the reputed author of a hymn of the Rigveda. 2) viii. 4. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 61.

devaapiaarShTiSheNa|देवापिआर्ष्टिषेण
देवापि आर्ष्टिषेण<BR> (‘descendant of Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa’) is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 98. and in the Nirukta. 2) ii. 10. According to the latter source there were two brothers, Devāpi and Śantanu, princes of the Kurus. The elder was Devāpi, but Śantanu got himself anointed king, whereupon no rain fell for twelve years. The drought being attributed by the Brahmins to his having superseded his elder brother, Śantanu offered the kingdom to Devāpi. The latter, however, refused, but acting as Purohita, or domestic priest, for his brother, obtained rain. The Bṛhaddevatā 3) vii. 148 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. tells much the same tale, but adds that the reason for Devāpi's exclusion from the throne was the fact that he suffered from a skin disease. The Epic and later legends further develop the story, presenting two somewhat discrepant accounts. According to the one version, 4) Mahābhārata, v. 5054 et seq. (= 149, 15 et seq.), where Śāntanu is (as also in the Agni, cclxxvii. 34, the Brahma, xiii. 114, 118, and the Viṣṇu Purāṇas) the form of the name; Matsya Purāṇa, l, 39 et seq., in which, as well as in the Bhāgavata, ix. 22, 12, 13, and the Vāyu Purāṇa, xcix. 234, 237, the form is Śantanu. the ground of Devāpi's being passed over was leprosy, while in the other his devoting himself to asceticism in his youth was the cause of his brother's taking his place. The Epic, 5) Mahābhārata, i. 3751 (= 94, 62); ix. 2285 (= 40, 1); Vāyu Purāṇa, ii. 37, 230, etc. moreover, treats him as a son of Pratīpa, and names as his brothers Bāhlīka 6) Mahābhārata, cited in n. 4; Harivaṃśa, 1819. and Āṛṣṭiṣeṇa, 7) Ibid., cited in n. 5. who is a new figure developed from the patronymic of Devāpi Possibly Sieg 8) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 136. is right in holding that two stories, those of Devāpi, Pratīpa's son, and of Devāpi, Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa's son, have been confused; but in any case it is impossible to extract history from them. 9) As does Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 52, 53. The Rigvedic hymn certainly appears to represent Devāpi as sacrificing for Śantanu, who seems to be called Aulāna. 10) Rv. x. 98, 11. But there is no trace in it of the brotherhood of the two men, nor is there anything to show that Devāpi was not a Brahmin, but a Kṣatriya. Sieg, 11) Op. cit., 129-142. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 272 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 203; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 192 et seq.; Macdonell, Bṛhaddevatā, 1, xxix; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 131, 132. who interprets the hymn by the Nirukta, thinks that he was a Kṣatriya, but on this occasion was enabled by the favour of Bṛhaspati to officiate as priest, and that the hymn shows clear recognition of the unusual character of his action; but this view seems very improbable.

devR|देवृ
देवृ<BR> is a rare word denoting the wife's ‘brother-in-law’ (that is, the husband's brother). He is included with the sisters of the husband among those over whom the wife of the husband--his elder brother--rules; 1) Rv. x. 85, 46. Cf. Pati. at the same time the wife is to be devoted to him, 2) Rv. x. 85, 44. and friendly to him. 3) Av. xiv. 2, 18. Cf. xiv. 1, 39. After the death of the husband the Devṛ could perform the duty of begetting a son for him. 4) Rv. x. 40, 2. Cf. x. 18, 8; Kaegi, Der Rigveda, n. 51; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 385; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 948. Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 516. No word occurs for the wife's brother corresponding to Devṛ.

desha|देश
देश,<BR> ‘land,’ is a word that does not come into use till the time of the Upaniṣads and Sūtras, 1) Where its use becomes common; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 1, 16; 2, 3; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 14, 6; Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, xv. 4, 17, etc. So the adjective deśīya, ‘belonging to a land,’ Kātyāyana, xxii. 4, 22; Lāṭyāyana Srauta Sūtra, viii. 6, 28. excepting one occurrence in the latest period of the Brāhmaṇa 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 10 (a late passage). literature, and one in a much-discussed passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 3) xxxiv. 11. where the Sarasvatī is mentioned as having five tributaries. This passage militates against the view that Sarasvatī was a name of the Indus, because the use of Deśa here seems to indicate 4) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 10, who thinks that the word crept into the text, where the Sarasvatī originally meant the Indus, with the five tributaries of the Panjab. that the seer of the verse placed the Sarasvatī in the Madhyadeśa or ‘Middle Country,’ to which all the geographical data of the Yajurvedas point. 5) Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 174.

dehii|देही
देही<BR> in two passages of the Rigveda 1) vi. 47, 2; vii. 6, 5. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 344; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 143. refers to defences thrown up against an enemy, apparently earthworks or dikes. Cf. Pur.

daidhiShavya|दैधिषव्य
दैधिषव्य<BR> is mentioned in a Mantra of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 1) iii. 2, 4, 4; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ii. 1, 22; Kauśika Sūtra, 3, 5; 137, 37. Apparently the word (as derived from Didhiṣū) denotes the son of a younger sister married before the elder sister, 2) American Journal of Philology, 17, 431, n. rather than the son of a woman twice married, the explanation of the St. Petersburg Dictionary. 

daiyaaMpaati|daiyaampaati|दैयांपाति|दैयाम्पाति
दैयांपाति,<BR> ‘descendant of Dayāṃpāta,’ is the name of a teacher of the east, who was instructed by Śāṇḍilyāyana, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ix. 5, 1, 14), in the lore of the construction of the fire-altar. The same patronymic is given, in the form of Dayyāṃpāti, to Plakṣa, the contemporary of Atyaṃhas in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 10, 9, 3-5).

daiva|दैव
1. Daiva (masc.) appears in the list of sciences in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 1) vii. 1, 2, 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. where Śaṅkara explains it as utpātajñāna, apparently the ‘knowledge of portents.’ The St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests that the word is here used adjectivally, and this view is followed by Little 2) Grammatical Index, 83. and by Böhtlingk in his translation. 3) Though he does not render it (Daiva Nidhi).

daiva|दैव
2. Daiva is the patronymic of the mythical Atharvan in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 (Mādhyaṃdina).

daivala|दैवल
दैवल,<BR> ‘descendant of Devala,’ is the patronymic of Asita in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 11, 18).

daivavaata|दैववात
दैव-वात,<BR> ‘descendant of Devavāta,’ is the patronymic of Sṛñjaya, probably the Sṛñjaya king, in the Rigveda. He is mentioned 1) Rv. iv. 15, 4. as a devotee of the fire cult, and as victorious over the Turvaśa king and the Vṛcīvants. 2) Rv. vi. 27, 7. According to Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 133, 134. his name was Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna Pārthava (‘descendant of Pṛthu’), but Hillebrandt 4) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105, 106. recognizes this as doubtful, though he none the less places the Sṛñjayas to the west of the Indus with Divodāsa. What is more important is to note that the name suggests connexion with the Bharata Devavāta, and as Kurus and Sṛñjayas were closely connected 5) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 4, 5. Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 402, 405; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 153. this is not immaterial. 

daivaapa|दैवाप
दैवाप,<BR> ‘descendant of Devāpi,’ is the patronymic of Indrota in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 5, 4, 1. and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 2) iii. 40, 1. No connexion can be traced with the Devāpi of the Rigveda. 3) x. 98. See Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 240.

daivaavRdha|दैवावृध
दैवावृध,<BR> ‘descendant of Devāvṛdha,’ is the patronymic of Babhru in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (vii. 34).

daivodaasi|दैवोदासि

doShaa|दोषा
दोषा,<BR> ‘evening,’ is frequently referred to from the Rigveda 1) i. 34, 3; 179, 1; ii. 8, 3; iv. 2, 8; v. 5, 6; 32, 11; vi. 5, 2, etc. onwards, 2) Av. vi. 1, 1; Nirukta, iv. 17. usually as contrasted with uṣas, ‘dawn.’ In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 3) vi. 13, 1. the word is contrasted with prātar, ‘early.’ See also Ahan.

doha|दोह
दोह,<BR> ‘milking,’ is a common word in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 11, 4. 9. 12; v. 17, 17; viii. 9, 15 (where five milkings are referred to metaphorically). In Rv. x. 42, 2, the literal sense is found. and later. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, viii. 62; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 10, 2; ii. 2, 9, 9, etc. Reference is made in the Sūtras 3) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 2, 38, etc. to the sāyaṃ-doha, ‘evening milking,’ and the prātar-doha, ‘morning milking.’ Dohana has the same sense. 4) Rv. viii. 12, 32; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, ix. 2, 3, 30; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 2, 37, etc. See also Go.

daureshravas|दौरेश्रवस्
दौरे-श्रवस्,<BR> ‘descendant of Dūreśravas,’ is the patronymic of the priest Pṛthuśravas, who officiated at the snake sacrifice described in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xxv. 15, 3). 

daureshruta|दौरेश्रुत
दौरे-श्रुत,<BR> ‘descendant of Dūreśruta,’ is the patronymic of the priest Timirgha, who officiated at the snake sacrifice described in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xxv. 15, 3).

daurgaha|दौर्गह
दौर्-गह<BR> See Durgaha.

dauHShanti|दौःषन्ति
दौः-षन्ति<BR> (‘descendant of Duḥṣanta’) is the patronymic of Bharata in the Aitareya (viii. 23) and Śatapatha (xiii. 5, 4, 11) Brāhmaṇas.

dyutaanamaaruta|द्युतानमारुत
द्युतान मारुत<BR> (‘descendant of the Maruts’) is the name of a divine being invoked in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 1) v. 27. and the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 2) v. 5, 9, 4. Cf. vi. 2, 10, 4. and also mentioned in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 3) xv. 7. In the Śatapatha 4) iii. 6, 1, 16. Brāhmaṇa the name is explained to mean Vāyu, while in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 5) xvii. 1, 7. Cf. vi. 4, 2. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 311; Indische Studien, 3, 220. he seems to be regarded as the author of a Sāman (chant). He is treated as a Ṛṣi by the Anukramaṇī, which credits him with the authorship of a hymn of the Rigveda (viii. 96).

dyumna|द्युम्न
द्युम्न,<BR> according to Pischel, 1) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 35, 720 et seq. denotes ‘raft’ in one passage of the Rigveda. 2) viii. 19, 14.

dyuuta|द्यूत
द्यूत,<BR> ‘dicing,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) xii. 3, 46. and the Sūtras. 2) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 6, 2; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 10, 23, etc. See Akṣa.

dyotana|द्योतन
द्योतन<BR> is, according to Sāyaṇa, the name of a prince in the Rigveda. 1) vi. 20, 8. This is probably correct, though the word may also 2) As by Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 380. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 55, 328. be interpreted as denoting ‘glorification’ but it is not clear what relation existed between Dyotana and the other persons mentioned in the same passage, Vetasu, Daśoṇi, Tūtuji, and Tugra. 

drapsa|द्रप्स
द्रप्स<BR> is a common word from the Rigveda onwards 1) Rv. i. 94, 11 (perhaps a ‘drop’ of fire); v. 63, 4 (‘rain-drop’); vii. 33, 11 (= retas); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1, 2, 6; drapsin (‘thick-flowing’), xi. 4, 1, 15. for a ‘drop’: according to Sāyaṇa, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 1, p. 70, 7. Cf. the epithet uru-drapsa, Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 3, 10, 2; Sāyaṇa, on Av. xviii. 4, 18, takes drapsa to mean ‘drops of curd’; so Agnisvāmin on Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iii. 2, 4. a ‘thick drop’ as opposed to stoka, a ‘small drop.’ Hence there frequently occurs the expression dadḥi-drapsa,’ ‘drop of curds.’ 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ix. 2, 3, 40. In the Rigveda 4) ix. 78, 4; 85, 10; 89, 2; 97, 56; 108, 8; x. 11, 4; 17, 11. 12. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 3, 9. 1. the word normally denotes the thick drops of Soma or the Soma itself. In two passages 5) iv. 13, 2, and drapsin in i. 64, 2. Roth 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. satvan; Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. drapsa, drapsin. sees the sense of ‘banner,’ which is adopted by Oldenberg. 7) Sacred Books of the East, 46, 357: Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 64, 65. Geldner, 8) Vedische Studien, 3, 57, 58; Rigveda, Glossar, 88. on the other hand, considers that ‘dust’ is meant, but this interpretation is not very probable. Max Müller 9) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 104. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 80, with reference to Rv. i. 64, 2. Cf. Macdonell, op. cit., pp. 105, 113. renders the word ‘rain-drop’ in one of the passages.

draapi|द्रापि
द्रापि<BR> occurs several times in the Rigveda 1) i. 25, 13; 116, 10; iv. 33, 2; ix. 86, 14; 100, 9; Av. iii. 13, 1. in the sense of ‘mantle’ or ‘cloak.’ 2) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 472; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 333. Sāyaṇa, however, renders the word by ‘coat of mail’ 3) Cf. Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 536; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 201, 202. (kavaca). This seems needless, but none of the passages are very decisive one way or the other.

dru|द्रु
द्रु<BR> denotes a vessel made of wood, 1) Rv. i. 161, 1; v. 86, 3; viii. 66, 11; in x. 101, 10, the mortar seems meant. In v. 86, 3, Böhtlingk takes it to denote a ‘wooden handle.’ and in particular the vessel used at the Soma sacrifice, 2) ix. 1, 2; 65, 6; 98, 2. perhaps, as Hillebrandt 3) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 191, 192. suggests, to catch the Soma juice when running through the sieve. In the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 4) i. 3, 9, 1. So often in compounds, e.g., Rv. ii. 7, 6; vi. 12, 4, etc. the word simply means ‘wood.’ 

drughaNa|द्रुघण
द्रु-घण<BR> is found in the Mudgala hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 101, 9. and in the Atharvaveda. 2) vii. 28, 1. The sense is uncertain. Yāska 3) Nirukta, ix. 23. renders it as a ‘ghana made of wood,’ probably, as Roth 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. takes it, meaning a ‘club of wood.’ Geldner 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 3, 4. thinks that it was a wooden bull used by Mudgala as a substitute for a second bull when he wanted to join in a race. But this interpretation of the legend is very improbable. 6) Cf. von Bradke, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 46, 462; Bloomfield, ibid., 48, 456; Franke, Vienna Oriental Journal, 8, 342. Whitney 7) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 407. translates the word as ‘tree-smiter’ in the Atharvaveda, quoting Sāyaṇa, who explains it as a ‘cutting instrument,’ so called because trees are struck with it.

drupada|द्रुपद
द्रु-पद,<BR> a ‘wooden pillar’ or ‘post,’ is several times referred to in the Rigveda 1) i. 24, 13; iv. 32, 23. and later. 2) Av. vi. 63, 3; 115, 2; xix. 47, 9; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xx. 20. Śunaḥśepa was bound to three posts for sacrifice. 3) Rv. i. 24, 13. Thieves, there is some evidence to show, were tied to posts as a penalty for stealing. 4) Av. xix. 47, 9; 50, 1. Cf. vi. 63, 3 = 84, 4. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 181, 182, and Taskara. n. 26.

druma|द्रुम
द्रुम,<BR> ‘tree,’ is not found until the later period in the Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (v. 11) and the Nirukta (iv. 19; v. 26; ix. 23).

druvaya|द्रुवय
द्रुवय,<BR> ‘wooden,’ is used in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 20, 2. Cf. xi. 1, 12, where it is an epithet of upaśvasa, ‘blower,’ possibly ‘bellows’; but the manuscripts in part read dhruvaye, and the Paippalāda has druye. as an epithet of the drum.

druhan|द्रुहन्
द्रु-हन्,<BR> ‘wood-cutter,’ seems to be meant by the word druhantara in the Rigveda, 1) i. 127, 2. where it is usually taken as druhaṃtara, ‘fiend-overpowering.’ But as an epithet of paraśu, ‘axe,’ the other sense (‘mighty wood-cutter’) 2) But if this explanation is correct, the word should have the accentuation of the comparative. See Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 132. is more probable. 3) Cf. Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 130. 

druhyu|द्रुह्यु
द्रुह्यु<BR> is the name of a people mentioned several times in the Rigveda. In one passage 1) i. 108, 8. it occurs, in the plural, with the Yadus, Turvaśas, Anus, and Pūrus, suggesting that these are the famous five peoples of the Rigveda. 2) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 122, 125; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 258 et seq. Again, the Druhyu king shared in the defeat of his allies by Sudās, and appears to have perished in the waters. 3) vii. 18. In a second passage Druhyu, Anu, Turvaśa, and Yadu are all mentioned in the singular, 4) viii. 10, 5. while in another Pūru and Druhyu occur. 5) vi. 46, 8. From the tribal grouping it is probable that the Druhyus were a north-western people, 6) Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 131-133. and the later tradition of the Epic connects Gāndhāra and Druhyu. 7) Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 49. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 205; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 140.

droNa|द्रोण
द्रोण<BR> denotes in the Rigveda 1) vi. 2, 8; 37, 2; 44, 20; ix. 93, 1; Nirukta, v. 26. a ‘wooden trough,’ and more specifically it designates in the plural vessels used for holding Soma. 2) ix. 3, 1; 15, 7; 28, 4; 30, 4; 67, 14, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 280. The great wooden reservoir for Soma is called a Droṇa-kalaśa. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 1, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 21; xix. 27; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 17, 32. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 17, etc. The altar was sometimes made in the form of a Droṇa. 4) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 7; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxi. 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 7, 2, 8.

droNaahaava|द्रोणाहाव
द्रोणाहाव<BR> is used as an epithet of Avata, ‘well,’ in the Rigveda, 1) x. 101, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 157. apparently in the sense of ‘having wooden buckets’ with reference to the drawing up of water.

dvaadasha|द्वादश
द्वादश,<BR> ‘consisting of twelve,’ 1) Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 645 et seq. is used of the year in the Rigveda (vii. 103, 9). See Nakṣatra.

dvaapara|द्वापर
द्वापर<BR> See Akṣa and Yuga. 

dvaar|द्वार्
द्वार्<BR> is frequently used from the Rigveda 1) i. 13, 6. onwards 2) Av. viii. 3, 22; xiv. 1, 63; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 1, 1, 2; xiv. 3, 1, 13, etc. to denote the ‘door’ of a house. The later form, Dvāra, has the same sense. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 1, 19; iv. 3, 5, 9; 6, 7, 9; xi. 4, 4, 2, etc. Av. x. 8, 43, has nava-dvāra, ‘having nine openings,’ of the body. Cf. Gṛha. The ‘door-fastener’ is called Dvārapidhāna in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 4) xi. 1, 1, 1. Cf. dvāra-bāhū, ‘doorposts,’ in Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 3, 1; ii. 3, 9.

dvaarapa|द्वारप
द्वार-प,<BR> ‘door-keeper,’ is only found in a metaphorical sense in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (i. 30), where Viṣṇu is called the ‘doorkeeper’ of the gods, and in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (iii. 13, 6).

dvigatbhaargava|द्विगत्भार्गव
द्वि-गत् भार्गव<BR> (‘descendant of Bhṛgu’) is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 9) as the seer of a Sāman or Chant, by means of which he twice went to the heavenly world.

dvija|द्विज
द्वि-ज,<BR> ‘twice-born,’ as an epithet of the Āryans generally, or of the Brahmins in particular, is not found in Vedic literature except in a quite obscure verse of the Atharvaveda. 1) xix. 71, 1. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 1008; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 204. Neither dvijanman nor dvi-jāti occurs early, and the idea is not in this form an early one.

dvipaad|द्विपाद्
द्वि-पाद्,<BR> ‘two-footed,’ ‘biped,’ denotes man, as opposed to quadrupeds, from the Rigveda 1) i. 49, 3; iii. 62, 14; viii. 27, 12; x. 97, 20; 117, 8. onwards. 2) Av. ii. 34, 1; x. 1, 24; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, viii. 30; ix. 31; xiii. 17; xiv. 8, etc.

dvibandhu|द्विबन्धु
द्वि-बन्धु<BR> is in an obscure hymn of the Rigveda, 1) x. 61, 17. according to Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary. and Grassmann, 3) Wörterbuch, s.v., and Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 475. the name of a man, while Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 643, and 5, 526. renders it as a simple adjective meaning ‘of double kinship.’ 

dviraaja|द्विराज
द्वि-राज<BR> (neut,), ‘conflict between two kings,’ or ‘battle,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda (v. 20, 9). Cf. Dāśarājña.

dviretas|द्विरेतस्
द्वि-रेतस्,<BR> ‘having double seed,’ is an epithet of both the ass 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 9; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 3, 1, 23. Cf. Gardabha. and the mare. 2) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1, 4.

dviipa|द्वीप
द्वीप,<BR> ‘island,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 169, 3. and later. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiii. 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 2, 1, 3; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sütra, i. 6, 10. But there is no reason to imagine that the islands referred to were other than sandbanks in the great rivers, Indus or Ganges. 3) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 256. Vedic literature knows nothing of the system of geography according to which the earth consists of four, seven, or thirteen Dvīpas grouped round Mount Meru.

dviipin|द्वीपिन्
द्वीपिन्,<BR> 1) Lit., ‘insulated’--i.e., ‘spotted.’ ‘panther’ or ‘leopard,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 2) iv. 8, 7; vi. 38, 2; xix. 49, 4, in every case associated with the tiger. and the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā. 3) ii. 1. 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 80.

dvaitavana|द्वैतवन
द्वैत-वन,<BR> ‘descendant of Dvitavana,’ is the patronymic of Dhvasan, the king of the Matsyas, whose Aśvamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 5, 4, 9).

dvyopasha|द्व्योपश
द्व्य्-ओपश<BR> See Opaśa. DH.

dhana|धन
धन,<BR> ‘prize,’ is often found in the Rigveda, 1) Rv. i. 81, 3; vi. 45, 2; viii. 80, 8; ix. 53, 2; 109, 10. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 120; Pischel, ibid., 1, 171. probably the prize in racing rather than the ‘booty’ in battle. It also denotes 2) Rv. x. 34, 10; Av. iv. 38, 3. the ‘stake’ at dicing. In some passages it possibly means the ‘contest’ itself. 3) Rv. i. 31, 6; v. 35, 7; vii. 38, 8; viii. 5, 26; 8, 21; 49, 9; 50, 9; x. 48, 5, etc. More generally it denotes ‘wealth’ or ‘gift.’ 4) Rv. i. 42, 6; x. 18, 2; 84, 7; Av. i. 15, 3; ii. 7, 4; iii. 15, 2; v. 19, 9; vi. 81, 1; vii. 81, 4; viii. 5, 16, etc. But it sometimes expresses ‘booty,’ 5) Rv. i. 74, 3; 157, 2, etc. probably from the notion of ‘wealth’ rather than of ‘prize.’

dhanadhaanii|धनधानी
धन-धानी,<BR> a ‘treasure house,’ is mentioned in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (x. 67).

dhaniShThaa|धनिष्ठा
धनिष्ठा<BR> (‘very rich’), used in the plural, is the later name 1) Sāntikalpa, 13; Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 26. of the lunar mansion (Nakṣatra) Śraviṣṭhā.

dhanu|धनु
धनु<BR> (fem.), ‘sandbank,’ occurs several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 33, 4; 144, 5; viii. 3, 19; x. 4, 3; 27, 17. but only metaphorically of the clouds in the atmosphere. Dhanū is found in the Atharvaveda, 2) i. 17, 4. where it seems to denote a sandbag used to prevent bleeding. 3) Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 411; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 18; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 259, 260. Cf. Dhanvan.

dhanus|धनुस्
धनुस्,<BR> the ‘bow,’ frequently mentioned in the Rigveda 1) viii. 72, 4; 77, 11; ix. 99, 1; x. 18, 9; 125, 6. and later, 2) Av. iv. 4, 6; 6, 6; v. 18, 8; vii. 50. 9; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 10; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vii. 5, 6; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 14; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 4, 6; v. 3, 1, 11, etc. was the chief weapon of the Vedic Indian. 3) Rv. vi. 75, 2. Practically no other weapon plays any substantial part in Vedic warfare. The last act of the funeral rite included the removal of the bow from the right hand of the dead man. 4) Rv. x. 18, 9. The weapon was composed of a stout staff bent into a curved shape (vakra), 5) Av. iv. 6, 4. and of a bowstring (Jyā) made of a strip of cowhide 6) Rv. vi. 75, 11; Av. i. 2, 3. which joined the ends. The tips of the bow, when the string was fastened, were called Ārtnī. Relaxed when not in actual use, the bow was specially strung up when needed for shooting. 7) Rv. x. 166, 3; Av. vi. 42, 1. The stages of the process are given in detail in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā: 8) xvi. 22. the stringing (ā-tan) of the bow, the placing (prati-dhā) of the arrow, the bending (ā-yam) of the bow, and the shooting (as). The arrow was discharged from the ear, 9) Rv. vi. 75, 2 et seq. So also in the Epic, Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 271. The Homeric method is to draw to the breast--e.g., Iliad, iv. 123. and is hence called karṇa-yoni, 10) Rv. ii. 24, 8. ‘having the ear as its point of origin.’ 10) Rv. ii. 24, 8. The making of bows was a regular profession (dhanuṣ-kāra, 11) xxx. 7. dhanuṣ-kṛt). 12) xvi. 46. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 298, 299; Hopkins, op. cit., 13, 270 et seq. The Epic bow is about 5(1/2) feet, and the arrow 3 feet in length. For the arrow see Iṣu, and for the handguard Hastaghna.

dhanvan|धन्वन्
1. Dhanvan, ‘bow,’ is found frequently in the Rigveda 1) ii. 24, 8; 33, 10; vi. 59, 7; 75, 2; viii. 20, 2; ix. 69, 1; Nirukta, ix. 17. and later. 2) Av. i. 3, 9; iv. 4, 7; xi. 9, 1, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 9, etc. It also occurs in the compounds iṣu-dhanva, ‘bow and arrow,’ 3) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 19; iṣudhanvin, Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 2. ājya-dhanva, 4) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 25. ‘having clarified butter for its bow,’ 5) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ix. 1, 1, 6. adhijya-dhanva, ‘bow with string fixed,’ etc. Cf. Dhanus.

dhanvan|धन्वन्
2. Dhanvan, ‘desert,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda 1) ii. 38, 7; iii. 45, 1; iv. 17, 2; 19, 7; 33, 7; v. 53, 6; 83, 10, etc. In i. 116, 4, the strand of the ocean (Samudra) is mentioned. and later. 2) Av. v. 13, 1; vi. 100, 1; vii. 41, 1, etc. Death from thirst in the desert was not rare, 3) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 19. and the value of a spring in the desert was fully appreciated. 4) Rv. x. 4, 1. Cf. vi. 34, 4, etc.; Av. i. 6, 4; xix. 2, 2. The great desert east of the Sindhu (Indus) and the Śutudrī (Sutlej) is possibly referred to in one hymn of the Rigveda. 5) x. 86, 20. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 47, 48.

dhamani|धमनि
धमनि,<BR> ‘reed,’ appears to denote ‘pipe’ in a passage of the Rigveda 1) ii. 11, 8. and in a citation appearing in the Nirukta. 2) vi. 24. In the Atharvaveda 3) i. 17, 23; ii. 33, 6; vi. 90, 2; vii. 35, 2. Cf. Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iii. 19, 2. it denotes, perhaps, ‘artery’ or ‘vein,’ or more generally ‘intestinal channel,’ being coupled in some passages 4) i. 17, 3; vii. 35, 2. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 259, 546. with Hirā.

dharuNa|धरुण
धरुण<BR> in one passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (viii. 51) denotes a ‘sucking calf.’

dharma|धर्म
धर्म,<BR> 1) i. 22, 18; 164, 43, 50; iii. 3, 1; 17, 1; 60, 6; v. 26, 6; 63, 7; 72, 2, etc.; Av. xiv. 1, 51; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 29, etc. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 90. Dharman, 2) Dharma is found in Av. xi. 7, 17; xii. 5, 7; xviii. 3, 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 5, 2, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xv. 6; xx. 9; xxx. 6, etc. are the regular words, the latter in the Rigveda, 1) i. 22, 18; 164, 43, 50; iii. 3, 1; 17, 1; 60, 6; v. 26, 6; 63, 7; 72, 2, etc.; Av. xiv. 1, 51; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 29, etc. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 90. and both later, 2) Dharma is found in Av. xi. 7, 17; xii. 5, 7; xviii. 3, 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 5, 2, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xv. 6; xx. 9; xxx. 6, etc. for ‘law’ or ‘custom.’ But there is very little evidence in the early literature as to the administration of justice or the code of law followed. On the other hand, the Dharma Sūtras 3) See Jolly, Recht und Sitte; Foy, Die königliche Gewalt nach den altindischen Rechtsbüchern; Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, 2 and 14. contain full particulars. (1) Criminal Law.--The crimes recognized in Vedic literature vary greatly in importance, while there is no distinction adopted in principle between real crimes and what now are regarded as fanciful bodily defects or infringements of merely conventional practices. 4) Compare the list in Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 9; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxi. 7; Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā, xlvii. 7; and Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 8, 11 (see Delbrück.

See also Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 11, 5, where Aśvapati's list of sinners includes a drinker of intoxicating liquor, a thief, and one who does not maintain a sacrificial fire. The crimes enumerated include the slaying of an embryo (bhrūṇa), 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 10, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvii. 9; xxxi. 7; Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā, xli. 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 9; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 8, 12; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 7, 8; 8, 3; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 1, 22; Nirukta, vi. 27; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iii. 1.

Vaira. For cases of justifiable homicide, see, e.g., Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, iii. 15-18. Cf. also the story of Vṛśa Jāna in Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 12, where the death of a boy by careless driving is mentioned, and the king is reproached for it by his Purohita. They dispute as to the guilt, and, according to one version (see Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 66, 67), the Ikṣvākus decide that the action was sinful, and required expiation. and  the slaying of a Brahmin, 7) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 1, 2; v. 3, 12, 1; vi. 5, 10, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxi. 7 (where the Kapiṣṭhala has brahma-jya, ‘oppressor of a Brahmin’); Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 8, 12. The Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, x. 38, declares that the slaying of a Brahmin alone is truly murder, and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 1, 1 et seq., states that the sin of murdering a Brahmin can be expiated only by the performance of an Aśvamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice’--the ne plus ultra of human generosity to Brahmins. See also Nirukta, vi. 27. The later tradition also interprets bhrūṇa as Brahmin (see Saṅkara, cited in Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 410, n.; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 30, n. 5; Konow, Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa, 46, n. 1, and cf. Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, xx. 23). a much more serious crime. Treachery is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 8) xiv. 6, 8, the story of Kutsa. as being punishable by death, as it was punished later. 9) Jolly, op. cit., 127. But there is no trace of an organized criminal justice vested either in the king or in the people. There still seems to have prevailed the system of wergeld (Vaira), which indicates that criminal justice remained in the hands of those who were wronged. In the Sūtras, 10) See references in Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, 345. on the other hand, the king's peace is recognized as infringed by crimes, a penalty being paid to him, or, according to the Brahminical textbooks, to the Brahmins. It may there fore reasonably be conjectured that the royal power of jurisdiction steadily increased; the references in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa to the king as wielding punishment (Daṇḍa) confirm this supposition. Whether, as the analogy of other systems suggests, the king was assisted in his judicial duties, as he undoubtedly was later, by assessors, presumably of the Brahmin caste, cannot be made out clearly. 11) Compare the story of the death of the child killed by Tryaruṇa, and the decision of the Ikṣväkus referred to in n. 6 above, and the notice in Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvii. 4, that a Rājanya is adhyakṣa, when a Sūdra is punished (han). The procedure adopted in deciding cases is quite uncertain. In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 12) vi. 16. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 72, 73. the ordeal of the red-hot axe is mentioned as applied in an accusation of theft. It must apparently be understood to have been inflicted by the direction of the king. But no other judicial ordeal is known to Vedic literature (see Divya). The punishment of theft was in some cases at least death, probably when the thief was taken redhanded; 13) Gautama Dharma Sūtra, xii. 43; Āpastamba Dharma Sūtra, i. 9, 25, 4. in other cases binding to posts was the penalty, 14) See Av. xix. 47, 9; 50, 1, and Taskara. presumably accompanied by the return of the stolen goods. In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 15) v. 10, 9. Another list is given in Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, x. 65, which includes slaying a Brahmin, defiling a Guru's bed, stealing a cow, drinking Surā, and killing an embryo, along with irregularities in offering a Śrāddha, ‘water offering to the dead.’ Cf. also Nirukta, vi. 27, for a list of seven. Many more appear in the Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa, but that work cannot claim to be a Brāhmaṇa proper. the list of sins given as apparently equal in wickedness is stealing gold, drinking spirits, defiling a Guru's bed, and the murder of a Brahmin. (2) Civil Law.--There is little recorded as to civil law in Vedic literature. The relations of the family and the question of family property are dealt with under Urvarā, Kṣetra, Pati; succession and partition of property are treated under Dāya. As regards the transfer of chattels--for land as transferable inter vivos is hardly yet recognized, save exceptionally as a sacrificial fee (Dakṣiṇā), and then disapproved 16) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 7, 1, 13.<BR> --the recognized modes are gift (Dāna) and barter or sale (Kraya), which includes exchange. Original acquisition of land was no doubt brought about by occupation and apportionment among the tribesmen, 17) Cf. Cæsar, Bellum Gallicum, iv. 1; vi. 22; Tacitus, Germania, 26, for Germany; Mommsen, Römisches Staatsrecht, 3, 1, 21, for the Roman hortus; and the Greek , Lang, Homer and the Epic, 236-241; Ridgeway, Journal of Hellenic Studies, 6, 319 et seq.; Grote, History of Greece, 2, 36, 37. See also Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law, 2, 337 et seq.; Baden Powell, Village Communities in India, 6 et seq.; 131. while chattels were acquired by taking possession of them, provided that they were found on one's own land or on unoccupied land, and did not belong to any other person originally. The Sūtras 18) Gautama Dharma Sūtra, x. 36 et seq. contain rules for the disposal of lost property, which tend to give it to the king, with the deduction of a percentage for the finder, unless the latter is a Brahmin, who keeps it all. As for contract, save in regard to moneylending (for which see Ṛṇa), practically nothing is to be gathered from Vedic literature, doubtless because of the primitive conditions prevailing in that early period. Much of the labour, which would in a more developed society have been done by workers for hire, would be performed by slaves (cf. Dāsa, Śūdra), while the technical workers of the village--of whom long lists are given in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 19) xxx. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 20) iii. 4. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 426 et seq.; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 75 et seq.<BR> --may have been recompensed not by any sum based on each piece of work done, but by fixed allowances, much as the village servants are in modern times. 21) Cf. Maine, Village Communities, 127, 175; Baden Powell, op. cit., 124 et seq.; Grote, History of Greece, 2, 36, n. 2. But this must remain a matter of conjecture, and it is uncertain what exact status the carpenter or smith held in the village. Similarly it is impossible to trace in the early literature any legal theory or practice as to torts, but rules as to penalties for insults appear in the Sūtras. 22) Cf. Jolly, op. cit., 126-128. Very little is recorded as to procedure. The list 23) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 10; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 6, 1. of victims at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ includes a praśnin, an abhi-praśnin, and a praśna-vivāka, in whom it is not unreasonable to see the plaintiff, the defendant, and the arbitrator or judge: the terms may refer to what is probably an early form of judicial procedure, a voluntary arbitration. The same idea may be conveyed by the word madhyama-śī, ‘lying in the midst,’ which occurs in the Rigveda, 24) x. 97, 12 = Av. iv. 9, 4 = Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xii. 86. Madhyamaśīvan, in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 408, is of quite doubtful sense. and which Roth, 25) Siebenzig Lieder, 174. This fact renders doubtful Lanman's view (Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 159) that the St. Petersburg Dictionary, in giving intercessor as the interpretation, did not mean ‘mediator,’ but ‘adversary.’ followed by Zimmer, 26) Altindisches Leben, 180. understood to mean an arbitrator or judge, the expression being derived from the judge acting with other judicial persons, 27) As, apparently, in early Germany. See Cæsar, Bellum Gallicum, vi. 23; Tacitus, Germania, 11, 12; Coulanges, Recherches sur quelques problèmes d'histoire, 361 et seq. and being surrounded by the assembly of the people. But this interpretation is uncertain; Whitney 28) See n. 25. thinks that the word merely alludes to a chief round whom his men encamp. The king is later the chief civil judge, and may presumably have been so earlier, no doubt in conjunction with the elders of the tribe, but for this we are reduced to conjecture. 29) Cf. the later Pariṣad, Gautama Dharma Sūtra, xxviii. 48, 49; Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra, i. 1, 7-16; Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, xi. 5-7, 20; Jolly, op. cit., 132 et seq. The parallels from other Āryan peoples suggest the use of assessors, as in the Anglo-Saxon courts of the shire and hundred. Cf. Sohm, Altdeutsches Reichs-und Gerichtsverfassung, 6 et seq. The use of witnesses as evidence is uncertain (see Jñātṛ), and the ordeal is not recorded as deciding any civil matter except the dispute between Vatsa and his rival as to the true Brahminical descent of the former, which was settled by his walking unharmed through the flame of a fire. 30) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 6, 6. But it is probable on analogy that the ordeal may have been used for the purpose of deciding disputes. Whether the oath was so used cannot be certainly shown. It appears, however, that a Brahmin was preferred in legal matters to a non-Brahmin. 31) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 11, 9, which seems to refer either to giving evidence for or passing judgment on a case when both a Brahmin and a nonBrahmin are engaged. There are very few references to police officials: no doubt the king employed some of his dependents to execute sentences and arrest offenders (see Ugra, Jīvagṛbh). (3) Morality.--It is convenient to notice under this head several points bearing on the moral condition of the people: (a) the exposure of children; (b) the exposure of the aged; (c) prostitution; (d) adultery; (e) incest. (a) The exposure of girl infants is asserted by Zimmer 32) Altindisches Leben, 319, 320. Cf. also Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 54, 260; Kaegi, Der Rigveda, n. 49; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 389, 390; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda. 6, 142; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 48. on the strength of a passage in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 33) xxvii. 9. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 10, 3; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 17, 12; Nirukta iii. 4. but it seems clear that the passage has been misunderstood, 34) Böhtlingk, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 44, 494496. The traditional rendering of the passages is not that it refers to exposure, but to getting rid of a daughter on her marriage. and that it refers merely to laying the child aside, not exposing it, while a boy was lifted up. It is, however, true that the birth of a girl was not at all popular, not an unnatural sentiment in an early society, and paralleled among other Āryan peoples. 35) Av. viii. 6, 25; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 15; Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 409; Zimmer, op. cit., 320; Schrader, op. cit., 390. (b) The exposure of the aged is also inferred by Zimmer 36) Op. cit., 327, 328. Strabo, pp. 513, 517, 520, reports the practice as prevailing in Iran, Bactria, and the Massagetae; it prevailed among the Norsemen, Weinhold, Altuordisches Leben, 473, and conceivably among the early Romans (depontani senes, Cicero, Pro Roscio, 100; but this and other cases may be really instances of the ritual casting into water of the wornout vegetation spirit for the purpose of reviving it). See Kaegi, op. cit., n. 50; Schrader, op. cit., 379, n. from a passage of the Rigveda, 37) viii. 51, 2. and from the mention of persons exposed (ud-hitāḥ) in the Atharvaveda. 38) xviii. 2, 34. See Anagnidagdha. The latter passage may well refer merely to the bodies being exposed after death to the elements (as is done by the Parsis). The former passage merely refers to the individual case of some person who may have been cast out, and proves absolutely nothing as to a habitual or recognized custom, nor can such a custom be inferred from, e.g., the legend of Cyavāna. (c) That prostitution existed in Rigvedic times is certain, but its extent is disputed. Brotherless girls were frequently reduced to becoming prostitutes; 39) Rv. i. 124, 7; iv. 5, 5; Av. i. 17, 1; and of. Ayogü. the putting away of an illegitimate child is referred to in the Rigveda; 40) ii. 29, 1. Cf. Max Müller, op. cit., 26. besides the terms puṃścalī 41) Av. xv. 2, etc. and mahānagnī, 42) Av. xiv. 1, 36; xx. 136, 5 et seq.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 27. Cf. nagnā in Av. v. 7, 8. which undoubtedly mean ‘harlot,’ there are other clear references to prostitution; 43) Rv. i. 167, 4 (Wilson, Translation of the Rigveda, 2, xvii), can hardly be so interpreted; see Zimmer, op. cit., 332, n. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 277, interprets it as a reference to polyandry, but this is still more doubtful; but see Rv. viii. 17, 7. and expressions like kumārī-putra, ‘son of a maiden,’ 44) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 6; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 2, 1. and the ‘son of an unmarried girl’ (agrū), spoken of in the Rigveda 45) iv. 19, 9; 30, 16. 19; ii. 13, 12; 15, 17; Zimmer, op. cit., 334, 335. as exposed and attacked by animals, point in the same direction. The Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 46) Apparently this is meant by the epithets atiṣkadvarī (apaskadvarī in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 11, 1), atītvarī, vijarjarā, in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 15. seems to recognize prostitution as a profession. Pischel 47) Vedische Studien, 1, xxv; 196, 275, 299, 309, etc.; 2, 120. sees many references to Hetairai in the Rigveda, which as Geldner 48) Ibid., 2, 154. insists reflects in its imagery the court life of Indian princes. But the correctness of the view of these two scholars on this point is not by any means certain. 49) Cf. Winternitz, Geschichte der indischen Litteratur, 1, 60; Jolly, op. cit., 48. (d) Adultery was generally regarded among Āryan peoples as a serious offence against the husband of the woman affected. We accordingly find in the legal literature of India traces of the rule that an adulterer can be slain with impunity if taken in the act. 50) Leist, Altarisches Jus Gentium, 276 et seq., 309. Weber, 51) Indische Studien, 10, 83 et seq. however, has adduced some material indicating an indifference to these matters in Vedic times, and Ludwig 52) Op. cit., 5, 573. has adopted the same view. But, as Delbrück 53) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 545 et seq. has clearly shown, the evidence is not convincing; the cited prescriptions 54) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 8, 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 7. forbidding connexion with another man's wife during a certain rite do not imply that such connexion would otherwise be allowed: the ritual of the Varuṇa-praghāsas, 55) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 10, 11; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 2, 20. when a wife names her lover or lovers, seems originally to have been a solemn means of banishing the evil brought on a family by a wife's fall; Yājñavalkya's famous saying 56) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 1, 21. that no one cares whether a wife is ‘unchaste’ (paraḥ-puṃsā) or not is a mere mistranslation, 57) So Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v.; Delbrück, op. cit., 548. the expression paraḥ-puṃsā really meaning ‘removed from the male persons.’ And the uncertainty asserted in some passages 58) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 4, 11; Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, cited in Ludwig, loc. cit. as to origin from a Ṛṣi is not a sign of doubtful descent, but is due to the fact that Ṛṣihood was a difficult matter to ascertain. None the less woman's position was lowered by the prevalence of polygamy, and such stories as that of Ahalyā and Indra 59) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 65. are not compatible with a very high standard of morality. A similar conclusion is pointed to by references in the Yajurveda 60) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 19, 2. 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 30. 31. to relations between the Ārya man and the Śūdrā woman, and by a spell given in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 61) vi. 4, 11. to expiate relations with the wife of a Śrotriya (Brahmin theologian). (e) Incest was recognized in the marriage of brother and sister as appears from the legend of Yama and Yamī in the Rigveda, 62) x. 10. which clearly shows that such a marriage was not approved by the feeling of the Vedic age. There is also another hymn 63) x. 162, 5. in which reference to such intercourse appears to be made. Mention is further made in the Rigveda 64) x. 61, 5-7. to the wedlock of Prajāpati and his daughter, which is, however, interpreted mythologically in the Brāhmaṇas, 65) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 33; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 4, 1; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 4, 46, 47; Max Müller, op. cit., 529, 530. an interpretation which may be correct. That incest, however, actually did take place is clear from the Atharvaveda; 66) viii. 6, 7. but even though the mythological interpretation of the passage were not justified, no conclusion could be drawn from the hymn as to the normal occurrence of such relations.

dhava|धव
1. Dhava is the name of a tree (Grislea tormentosa) mentioned, together with the Plakṣa, Aśvattha, and Khādira, in the Atharvaveda. 1) v. 5, 5; xx. 137, 11. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62. 

dhava|धव
2. Dhava, ‘man,’ is not found before the Nirukta. 1) iii. 15. Cf. Naighaṇṭuka, ii. 3. The word clearly owes its existence merely to vidhavā, ‘widow,’ wrongly interpreted as vi-dhavā, ‘without a husband.’

dhavitra|धवित्र
धवित्र,<BR> occurring in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xiv. 1, 3, 30; 3, 1, 21. and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, 2) v. 4, 33. denotes a ‘fan’ of hide or leather for blowing the sacrificial fire.

dhaanaMjayya|धानंजय्य
धानं-जय्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Dhanaṃ-jaya,’ is the patronymic of Aṃśu in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373. Under this patronymic he is frequently named by Lāṭyāyana Srauta Sūtra, i. 1, 25; ii. 1, 2; 9, 10, etc. (misread Dhānaṃjapya in many manuscripts). Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 76, 77, 82.

dhaanaa|धाना
धाना,<BR> always used in the plural, and frequently referred to in the Rigveda 1) i. 16, 2; iii. 35, 3; 52, 5; vi. 29, 4, etc. and later, 2) Av. xviii. 3, 69; 4, 32. 34; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 21, 22; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 11, 2, etc. means ‘grains of corn.’ They were sometimes parched (bhṛjj), 3) Rv. iv. 24, 7. and were regularly mixed with Soma. 4) Rv. iii. 43, 4; 52, 1; viii. 91, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 10, 2; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 4, 3, 9. Cf. Schrader, Prchistoric Antiquities, 283.

dhaanya|धान्य
धान्य<BR> (neut.), a derivative from the preceding word, 1) Primarily as an adjective, ‘consisting of grain.’ denotes ‘grain’ in general. It is found in the Rigveda 2) vi. 13, 4. and later. 3) Av. iii. 24, 2. 4; v. 29, 7; vi. 50, 1; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xi. 8; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, etc. According to the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 4) vi. 3, 22 (Mādhyaṃdina = 13 Kāṇva). there are ten cultivated (grāmyāṇi) kinds of grain: rice and barley (vrīhiyavāḥ), sesamum and beans (tila-māṣāḥ), Panicum Miliaceum and Italicum (aṇu-priyaṅgavaḥ), maize (godhūmāḥ), lentils (masūrāḥ), Khalvāḥ and Dolichos uniflorus (khala-kulāḥ). The horse is called ‘corn-eating’ (dhānyāda) in the Aitareya 5) viii. 21. and Śatapatha 6) xiii. 5, 4, 2. Brāhmaṇas, and men are mentioned as ‘purifying corn’ (dhānyā-kṛt) in the Rigveda. 8) x. 94, 13. 7 Lit., ‘preparing corn.’

dhaanva|धान्व
धान्व<BR> is the patronymic of Asita in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) xiii. 4, 3, 11; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 7. In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 2) xvi. 2, 20. the form of the name is Dhānvana.

dhaaman|धामन्
धामन्<BR> denotes in the Rigveda 1) i. 144, 1; ii. 3, 2; iii. 55, 10; vii. 61, 4; 87, 2; x. 13, 1, etc. and later 2) Av. iv. 25, 7; vii. 68, 1; xii. 1, 52; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iv. 34; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 7, 2. ‘dwelling’ and ‘house,’ or sometimes 3) Rv. viii. 101, 6; ix. 63, 14; x. 82, 3; Av. ii. 14, 6. Many of the examples given in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., C, are doubtful. its inmates. The word is also 4) Rv. iv. 55, 2; vi. 21, 3; vii. 63, 3; viii. 41, 10; x. 48, 11. found in the sense of ‘ordinance,’ ‘law,’ expressing much the same as Dharman, especially in conjunction 5) Rv. i. 123, 9; iv. 7, 7; vii. 36, 5; x. 124, 3. with Rta, ‘eternal order.’ Hillebrandt 6) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 446. sees in one passage 7) Rv. ix. 66, 2. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 92, 93. the sense of Nakṣatra.

dhaaraa|धारा
धारा<BR> denotes the ‘edge’ of a weapon, 1) Rv. vi. 3, 5; 47, 10. Cf. viii. 73, 9; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iv. 38, 1, for metaphorical applications. as of an axe (svadhiti), 2) Kauśika Sūtra, 44. or of a razor (kṣura). 3) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 3, 2. See also Asi.

dhiShaNaa|धिषणा
धिषणा,<BR> according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, denotes 1) Rv. i. 96, 1; 102, 1; 109, 3, 4; iii. 49, 1; iv. 34, 1; 36, 8; viii. 61, 9; ix. 59, 2; x. 17, 12; 30, 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 19; vi. 26, 35, etc. an implement used in preparing the Soma, ‘bowl’ or ‘vat,’ and by metonymy also the Soma draught itself. 2) Rv. i. 102, 7; iii. 32, 14; 49, 4; vi. 19, 2; vii. 90, 3; viii. 15, 7; x. 96, 10, etc. The dual, by a metaphor, 3) Like Camū. also expresses the ‘two worlds,’ heaven and earth. 4) Rv. i. 160, 1; vi. 8, 3; 50, 3; 70, 3; x. 44, 8; in the plural, ‘the three worlds,’ Rv. v. 69, 2. In other passages, Rv. i. 22, 10; iii. 56, 6; v. 41, 8; vi. 11, 3; x. 35, 7, the sense of ‘a genius of prosperity’ was assigned to Dhiṣaṇā by Roth. Hillebrandt, 5) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 175-181. however, thinks that the word properly means earth, 6) Rv. i. 22, 10; 96, 1; 102, 1; iii. 31, 13; 56, 6; vi. 19, 2; vii. 90, 3; viii. 15, 7; x. 30, 6; 35, 7; 96, 10. in the dual heaven and earth, 7) See n. 3; also Rv. viii. 61, 2; nivid in Sāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 19, 4. in the plural the triad, earth, atmosphere, and heaven, 8) Rv. iv. 36, 8; v. 69, 2; ix. 59, 2. while in some passages 9) Rv. i. 109, 3, 4; iii. 2, 1; 49, 4 (or perhaps ‘earth’); iv. 34, 1; v. 41, 8; vi. 11, 3; x. 17, 12. Dhiṣaṇā denotes the Vedi, the excavated ground used as an altar. This is not, however, certain, while it seems clear that the Vājasaneyi 10) vii. 26. and Taittirīya 11) iii. 1, 10, 1. Saṃhitās understand the Dhiṣaṇās (dual) to be the planks over which the pressing of the Soma took place (adhiṣavaṇa-phalake). 12) Mahīdhara on Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vii. 26; Sāyaṇa on Taittirīya Saṃhitā, loc. cit. Pischel 13) Vedische Studien, 2, 82-87. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 124; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 120-122. sees in Dhiṣaṇā a goddess of wealth akin to Aditi and the earth.

dhii|धी
धी,<BR> ‘thought,’ is used several times in the Rigveda 1) i. 3, 5; 135, 5; 151, 6; 185, 8; ii. 3, 8 (where it is connected with Sarasvatī); 40, 5, etc. to denote the ‘prayer’ or ‘hymn of praise’ of the singer. One poet speaks of himself as ‘weaving’ such a prayer, 2) Rv. ii. 28, 5. while another refers to his ‘ancient ancestral hymn,’ which he refurbishes presumably for use. 3) Rv. iii. 39, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 338.

dhiiti|धीति
धीति<BR> has in several passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 110, 1; iii. 12, 7; 52, 6; v. 25, 3; 53, 11; vi. 15, 9, etc.; Nirukta, ii. 24. practically the same sense as Dhī, ‘prayer,’ or ‘hymn of praise.’

dhiirashaataparNeya|धीरशातपर्णेय
धीर शात-पर्णेय<BR> (‘descendant of Śataparṇa’) is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (x. 3, 3, 1) as a pupil of Mahāśāla. 

dhiivan|धीवन्
धीवन्<BR> occurs in the Atharvaveda, 1) iii. 5, 6. where it may either be taken with Roth, 2) St. Petersbuig Dictionary, s.v. Bloomfield, 3) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 114. and Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 114. Cf. Weber, Indīsche Studien, 17, 194 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 252. as an epithet of ‘chariot-builders’ (ratha-kārāḥ), meaning ‘clever,’ or be construed with the scholiast as denoting ‘fishermen’ (dhīvara). The Paippalāda recension has takṣāṇaḥ, ‘carpenters.’

dhunkShaa|धुङ्क्षा
धुङ्क्षा<BR> is the name of some sort of bird in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 12; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 31. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93. See also Dhūṅkṣṇā and Dhvāṅkṣa.

dhuni|धुनि
धुनि<BR> is the name of a foe of Indra, normally mentioned along with Cumuri in the Rigveda. 1) ii. 15, 9; vi. 18, 8; 20, 13; vii. 19, 4. He and Cumuri seem to have been opposed to Dabhīti. 2) Rv. x. 113. 9. His name is probably that of an aboriginal chief. 3) Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 1, xxii; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 162. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 157, 158.

dhur|धुर्
धुर्<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 84, 16; 100, 16; 134, 3; 164, 19; ii. 18, 7; iii. 35, 2; v. 55. 6; vii. 34, 4, etc. and later 2) Av. v. 17, 18; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa vi. 18; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2 10; 4, 4, 13, etc.; Aitareya Āraṇyaka i. 5, 2 (the Dhur is the end), etc. denotes, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, that part of the yoke which is placed on the shoulders of the animals drawing the chariot or cart, whence they are called dhūr-ṣāh, ‘yoke-bearing,’ in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 3) iv. 33. Cf. Uara. In one passage of the Rigveda 4) v. 43. 8. the sense is uncertain: Roth 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 2. takes it to mean the pin at either end of the axle (Akṣa) which goes through the nave of the wheel, and would thus be equivalent to Āṇi, and Oldenberg 6) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 339; Griffith. Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 508. The akṣadhurau are mentioned in the Āpastamba Srauta Sūtra, xi. 6, 5; Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, viii. 3, 22. Cf. Caland and Henry. L'Agniṣṭoma, 31. seems to adopt the same view. Monier Williams 7) Dictionary, s.v. seems to think that ‘load’ is meant, but this is not probable. It is possible that Dhur has the sense of ‘pole,’ 8) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 246. Later, the word means the ‘end of the pole,’ a sense already found in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka (n. 2). This modification of meaning seems to be due to the fact that the yoke is at the end of the pole. See also Dhūrṣad. and then more generally still the pole and the axle together regarded as the drawing part of the chariot: this might explain the use in the doubtful passage of the Rigveda.

dhuunkShNaa|धूङ्क्ष्णा
धूङ्क्ष्णा<BR> is the form in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) v. 5, 19, 1. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93, gives the form as Dhūṅkṣṇa. perhaps in error. Cf. also Dhvāṅkṣa. of the name of the bird elsewhere found as Dhuṅkṣā. It is glossed as ‘white crow’ (śveta-kākī).

dhuumaketu|धूमकेतु
धूम-केतु,<BR> ‘smoke-bannered,’ is an epithet of Mṛtyu, ‘death,’ in the Atharvaveda. 1) xix. 9, 10. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 358. thinks that a comet is meant, but Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 914. considers this extremely improbable. Lanman 4) Ibid. plausibly suggests that the smoke of the funeral pile is referred to.

dhuumra|धूम्र
धूम्र<BR> in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (i. 8, 21, 1) denotes ‘camel’ according to Böhtlingk's Dictionary.

dhuurShad|धूर्षद्
धूर्-षद्<BR> means, according to Roth, 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. ‘standing under the yoke’ and so ‘burden-bearing,’ and thus metaphorically ‘promoting,’ in the passages of the Rigveda 2) i. 143, 7; ii. 2, 1; 34, 4 (but cf. Pischel. Vedische Studien, 1, 301). In x. 132, 7, Roth renders ‘resting on the yoke.’ where it occurs. More probable, however, is the view 3) Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 237 et seq.; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 195. that it means ‘sitting on the pole,’ that is, ‘charioteer,’ with reference to the fact that to get near his horses the charioteer might well go forward and sit on the pole or even on the yoke. 4) Cf. Mahābhārata, viii. 617: dhuryān dhuryagatān sūtān.

dhRtaraaShTra|धृतराष्ट्र
1. Dhṛta-rāṣṭra (‘having his kingdom firmly established’) is the name of a snake demon with the patronymic Airāvata, ‘descendant of Irāvant,’ in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 10, 29. and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 2) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iv. 26, 15; Weber, Indische Studien, 17. 257.

dhRtaraaShTravaichitraviirya|धृतराष्ट्रवैचित्रवीर्य
2. Dhṛtarāṣṭra Vaicitra-vīrya (‘descendant of Vicitravīrya’) is mentioned in a passage of the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 1) x. 6. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 469 et seq. which is, unhappily, far from intelligible. But there is no ground for supposing that he was a Kuru-Pañcāla king; he seems rather to have lived at some distance from the KuruPañcālas. There is no good reason to deny his identity 2) As does Weber, Indian Literature, 90, 114, 125; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 7, 8. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., treats them as identical. with the Dhṛtarāṣṭra of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 3) xiii. 5, 4, 22. king of Kāśi, who was defeated, when he attempted to offer a horse sacrifice, by Sātrājita Śatānīka. The fact that the latter was a Bharata also points to Dhṛtarāṣṭra's not having been a Kuru-Pañcāla at all. In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā he appears as having a dispute with Vaka Dālbhi; but even assuming that the latter was a Pañcāla, there is nothing to hint that the former was a Kuru or that this dispute is a sign of an early hostility of Kuru and Pañcāla. 4) Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 831 et seq. This argument is independent of the identification of the two Dhṛtarāṣṭras, but is confirmed by it. It is true that in the Epic Śantanu and Vicitravīrya and Dhṛtarāṣṭra himself are all connected, but this connexion seems to be due, as so often in the Epic, to a confused derangement of great figures of the past.

dhRShTi|धृष्टि
धृष्टि,<BR> found in the dual in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, 1) v. 9, 8. the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 2) xiv. 3, 1, 22. and the Sūtras, 3) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxvi. 2, 10, etc. seems to denote ‘firetongs.’ 

dhenaa|धेना
धेना<BR> denotes a ‘milch cow,’ 1) Rv. iii. 34, 3 (Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 61); v. 62, 2. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 114. or in the plural, ‘draughts of milk.’ 2) Rv. iii. 1, 9; iv. 58, 6, etc. In two passages 3) i. 101, 10; v. 30, 9. Roth 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. takes the word to mean ‘mare,’ and in another the ‘team’ of Vāyu's chariot. Benfey, 6) Orient und Occident, 3, 130. on the other hand, renders it ‘lips’ in one passage, 7) Rv. i. 101. 10. with Sāyaṇa and with Durga's commentary on the Nirukta. 8) vi. 17. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 249. Geldner 9) Vedische Studien, 3, 35-43; 166; Rigveda, Glossar, 95. assigns to the word the senses of ‘lips,’ 10) Rv. i. 101. 10; iii. 1, 9. ‘speech,’ 11) Rv. iv. 58, 6; i. 55, 4; 141, 1; viii. 32, 22; x. 104, 3. 10. ‘cow,’ 12) Rv. v. 62, 2, and Vāyu's cow of plenty, i. 2, 3. ‘beloved,’ 13) Rv. v. 30, 9. and ‘streams.’ 14) Rv. vii. 21, 3; iii. 34, 3. Cf. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 441, 442. 5) Rv. i. 2, 3.

dhenu|धेनु
धेनु<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 32, 9 (saha-vatsā, ‘with her calf’); 134, 4; ii. 2, 2; 34, 8; vi. 135, 8, etc. and later 2) Av. v. 17, 18; vii. 104. 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 2, 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 27; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 1, 21, etc. means ‘milch cow,’ which is often mentioned with special reference to the production of milk, 3) Rv. vii. 33. 22; viii. 14, 3; Av. iv. 34, 8 (kāma-dughā, ‘milking desires,’ the later ‘cow of plenty’ of the Epic); Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 8, 2, 2. and is contrasted with the ‘bull’ (vṛṣabha, 4) Rv. x. 5, 7. pumāṃs, 5) Av. xi. 1, 34. anaḍvāh). 6) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 27; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 2, 21. In the plural 7) Rv. iv. 22, 6; viii. 2, 6; 4, 8; ix. 61, 21; 72, 1, etc. the word denotes ‘draughts of milk.’ The derivative, dhenukā, means merely ‘female.’ 8) Av. iii. 23, 4; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. xxv. 10, 23; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 6, etc.

dhenuShTarii|धेनुष्टरी
धेनु-ष्टरी<BR> in the Kāṭhaka (xiii. 6) and Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (ii. 5, 4) denotes a cow which has ceased to give milk.

dhaivara|धैवर
धैवर<BR> means a ‘fisherman,’ as a member of a caste, 1) This seems to be shown by the patronymic form, ‘descendant of a dhīvara.’ in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘human sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 16; Tait tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 15, 1. Cf. Dhīvara. 

dhmaatR|ध्मातृ
ध्मातृ<BR> (lit. ‘blower’) occurs twice in one passage of the Rigveda 1) v. 9. 5. in the two forms, dhmātā, nom. ‘smelter,’ and dhmātarī, which, according to the Padapāṭha, stands for dhmātari, a locative probably meaning ‘in the smelting furnace.’ 2) Macdonell, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1893, 446. Geldner, 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 146, n, 1. Bartholomae, 4) Indogermanische Forschungen, 1, 496. n. 2. and Oldenburg 5) Sacred Books of the East, 46, 388. regard the latter form as a locative infinitive, ‘in the smelting.’ Ludwig 6) Infinitiv im Veda, 9; Translation of the Rigveda, 4, 334. and Neisser 7) Bezzenberger's Beitrāge, 20, 40. think dhmātarī is a nom. sing. masc. used in the same sense as dhmātā. Smelting is also clearly referred to, 8) Rv. iv. 2, 17. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1, 3. 5, Ayas is smelted from the ore (aśman), and gold from the Ayas. and the smelter is described as using the wings of birds (parṇa śakunānām) to fan the flame. 9) Rv. ix. 112, 2. That the art was widely applied is shown by the fact that reference is made to arrows with points of Ayas, 10) Cf. Īṣu. to kettles which were fashioned of the same metal and could be placed upon a fire, 11) Rv. v. 30, 15. and to Soma cups of beaten Ayas. 12) Rv. ix. 1, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 252; Schrader, Prchistoric Antiquities, 159.

dhraaji|ध्राजि
ध्राजि<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 164. 44; x. 97, 13; 136, 2. and later 2) Av. iii. 1, 5; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 2, 17; iv. 9, 5 Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, i 11, 19, etc. denotes the ‘sweep’ of the wind, referring no doubt to the violent gales which often blow in India devastating the forests, and which figure in the descriptions of the Maruts, or storm gods. 3) Cf. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, xxxii. xxiii et seq.; Macdonell. Vedic Mythology, p. 79.

dhruva|ध्रुव
ध्रुव<BR> in the Sūtras 1) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 7, 22; Sāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 17, 2 et seq.; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iii. 3, 6, etc. It is to be noted that the marriage Mantras, of which we have a great many, do not include any reference to the Dhruva; but it is not possible to say definitely whether the practice is really an old one or not denotes the pole star, being mentioned in connexion with the marriage ritual, in which the star is pointed out to the bride as an emblem of constancy. In the Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad, 2) See Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 15, 289; Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 396. a late work, the movement of the Dhruva (dhruvasya pracalanam) is mentioned, but this can hardly be interpreted as referring to an actual observed motion of the nominal pole star, 3) As understood by Weber, Indian Literature, 98, n. 103; Bühler, Indian Antiquary, 23, 245, n. 21; Jacobi, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 49, 228, n. 2. but rather to an extraordinary event, such as a destruction of the world, as Cowell understood the expression. 4) In his edition of the Upaniṣad, p. 244. Jacobi 5) Indian Antiquary, 23, 157; Zeitschrift, loc. cit., 50, 69 et seq.; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 721 et seq.; 1910, 461 et seq. sees in the motion of the Dhruva the possibility of fixing a date, on the ground that the only star which could have been deemed a pole star, as ‘immovable,’ was one (a Draconis) of the third millenium B.C. But this attempt to extract chronology from the name of the star is of very doubtful validity. 6) Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, xc; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1102; 1910, 465 et seq.

dhruvaa|ध्रुवा
ध्रुवा,<BR> ‘fixed,’ as an epithet of Diś, ‘cardinal point,’ denotes the ground under one's feet. 1) Av. iii. 27, 5; xii. 3, 59; xv. 6, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 14 (cf. Madhyadeśa); Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 9, 25, etc.

dhvaja|ध्वज
ध्वज<BR> occurs twice in the Rigveda 1) vii. 85, 2; x. 103, 11. In Epic warfare banners are of vast importance -e.g., Rāmāyaṇa, ii. 67, 26; they were attached to a pole on the chariot, Mahabhārata, vii. 3332, etc. The army was called dhvajinī, ‘bannered host,’ ibid., i. 2875, etc. in the sense of ‘banner’ used in battle. It is characteristic of Vedic fighting that in both passages reference is made to arrows being discharged and falling on the banners.

dhvanya|ध्वन्य
ध्वन्य<BR> is apparently the name of a patron, son of Lakṣmaṇa, in a hymn of the Rigveda. 1) v. 33, 10. Cf. Ludwig Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155. 

dhvasandvaitavana|ध्वसन्द्वैतवन
ध्वसन् द्वैत-वन<BR> (‘descendant of Dvitavana’) is the name in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 5, 4, 9. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 211; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 6. of the king of the Matsyas who celebrated an Aśvamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ near the Sarasvatī.

dhvasanti|ध्वसन्ति
ध्वसन्ति<BR> is in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 112, 23. mentioned together with Puruṣanti as having been aided by the Aśvins. There can be no doubt that this is the longer form of the name Dhvasra, which is found with Puruṣanti both in the Rigveda 2) ix. 58. 3 = Sv. ii. 409. and in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 3) xiii. 7, 12 (where the dual of Dhvasra appears as a feminine Dhvasre). Cf. Sieg. Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 62, 63; Benfey, Sāmaveda, 105, 126, who is inclined to think that Dhvasanti and Puruṣanti are names of women.

dhvasra|ध्वस्र
ध्वस्र<BR> is named with Puruṣanti in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 7, 12. Cf. Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 139; Sāṭyāyanaka, apud Sāyaṇa, on Rv. ix. 58, 3. as giving gifts to Taranta and Purumīḍha. These two, being kings, could not 2) Mānava Dharma Śāstra, x. 75, 77. properly accept gifts which Brāhmaṇas alone could accept, but by becoming authors of a verse of the Rigveda 3) ix. 58, 3. they qualified themselves to accept them. The verse mentions the names in the dual as Dhvasrayoḥ Puruṣantyoḥ, ‘from the two, Dhvasra and Puruṣanti.’ 4) Both words are in the dual, as if they were members of a Dvandva compound. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 261. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 5) Loc. cit. the names occur in the dual as Dhvasre Puruṣantī, a reading which is confirmed by the Nidāna Sūtra. 6) ix. 9. The former is necessarily a feminine form, though Sāyaṇa, in his comment on the passage, explains it as really an irregular masculine. According to Roth, 7) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. dhvasra. the feminine is a corruption based on the dual form in the verse of the Rigveda mentioned above; but the names may be those of women, 8) The first would in that case be Dhvasrā. as Benfey 9) Sāmaveda, 105. 126, under Dhvasanti and Puruṣanti. inclines to believe. Weber 10) Episches im vedischen Ritual, 27, n. 1. suggests that the two were demons, but this is, as Sieg 11) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 62, 63. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 139; Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 39; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 360, points out that the sense of the Rīgveda passage is quite uncertain, and that the two, Taranta and Purumīḷha, as they appear in Rv. v. 61, are rather donors than receivers (see, however, verse 9, Purumīṭhāya viprāva). See also Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 232; Ṛgveda-Noteu, 1, 354. shows, quite unnecessary. Dhvasra is no doubt identical with Dhvasanti.

dhvaankSha|ध्वाङ्क्ष
ध्वाङ्क्ष,<BR> ‘crow,’ is mentioned twice in the Atharvaveda, 1) xi. 9, 9; xii. 4, 8. and in the Sūtras. 2) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra xxv. 6, 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 88. Possibly the same bird is meant by the words Dhuṅkṣā and Dhūṅksnā.

dhvaanta|ध्वान्त
ध्वान्त<BR> is the name of some wind in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 7, 7, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxix. 7. and later. 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 16, 1; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iv. 24, 1; 25, 1. N.

nakula|नकुल
नकुल,<BR> ‘ichneumon,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 139, 5. as being able to cut a snake in two and then join it up again. Its knowledge 2) Av. viii. 7, 23. of a remedy against snake poison is also mentioned. The animal figures in the list of sacrificial victims at the Aśvamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 12, 1; 21, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 26. 2; Maītrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 7 In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 3, 18, 1; Ṛgveda Prātiśākhya, xvii. 9, nakula denotes a colour--no doubt that of the ichneumon. 

nakta|नक्त
नक्त,<BR> ‘night,’ is found frequently in the Rigveda, 1) i. 13, 7; 73, 7; 96, 5; vii. 2, 6; x. 70, 6; adverbially, i. 24, 10; 90, 7; v. 76, 3; vii. 15, 15; 104, 17; viii. 96, 1. and sometimes later, 2) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 4, 2, adverbially, Av. vi. 128, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 4, 2; xiii. 1, 5, 5, etc. usually in the adverbial form naktaṃ, ‘by night’

naxatra|नक्षत्र
नक्षत्र<BR> is a word of obscure origin and derivation. The Indian interpreters already show a great divergence of opinion as to its primary meaning. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) ii. 1, 2, 18. 19. Cf. a citation in Nirukta, iii. 20. resolves it into na-kṣatra (‘no power’), explaining it by a legend. The Nirukta 2) Loc. cit., and of. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. refers it to the root nakṣ, ‘obtain,’ following the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 3) i. 5, 2, 5. Aufrecht 4) Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 8, 71, 72. So Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 288, n. 2. and Weber 5) Naxatra, 2, 268. derived it from nakta-tra, ‘guardian of night,’ and more recently 6) Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 74. line 8. the derivation from nak-kṣatra, ‘having rule over night,’ seems to be gaining acceptance. The generic meaning of the word therefore seems to be ‘star.’ The Nakṣatras as Stars in the Rigveda and Later.--The sense of ‘star’ appears to be adequate for all or nearly all the passages in which Nakṣatra occurs in the Rigveda. 7) See i. 50, 2; vii. 86, 1; x. 68, 11; 111, 7; used of the sun itself, vi. 67, 6 (as masculine); vii. 81, 2; x. 88, 13. The sun is allied with them, iii. 54, 19. Nakṣatra-śavas, ‘equalling the multitude of the stars,’ is used as an epithet in x. 21, 10. Even in x. 85, 2, where Soma, on the lap of the Nakṣatras, is mentioned, ‘stars’ would do; but, as this hymn refers to two of the later Nakṣatras, ‘lunar mansions’ may well be meant. The same sense occurs in the later Saṃhitās also: the sun and the Nakṣatras are mentioned together, 8) Av. vi. 10, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 43; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, x. 1, 1; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iv. 10, 12. or the sun, the moon, and the Nakṣatras, 9) Av. vi. 128, 3; xv. 6, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 13, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 29, etc. or the moon and the Nakṣatras, 10) Av. v. 24, 10; vi. 86, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 5, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxv. 15; xxxvii. 12; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 21; xxxix. 2, etc. or the Nakṣatras alone; 11) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 2, 2, 2; ii 6, 2, 6, etc; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 21 etc.; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, Aśvamedha, v. 5, and very often elsewhere. but there is no necessity to attribute to the word the sense of ‘lunar mansion’ in these passages. On the other hand, the names of at least three of the Nakṣatras in the later sense occur in the Rigveda. Tiṣya, 12) Rv. v. 59, 13; x. 64, 8; Weber, 2, 290. however, does not seem to be mentioned as a lunar mansion. With Aghās (plur.) and Arjunī (dual) 13) x. 85, 13; Weber, 364-367, and see references under Aghā and Arjunī. the case is different: it seems probable that they are the later lunar mansions called Maghās (plur.) and Phalgunī (dual). The names appear to have been deliberately changed in the Rigveda, and it must be remembered that the hymn in which they occur, the wedding hymn of Sūryā, has no claim to great age. 14) Cf. Arnold, Vedic Metre, 322. Ludwig 15) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 184 et seq. and Zimmer 16) Altindisches Leben, 354. Cf. Tilak, Orion, 158. have seen other references to the Nakṣatras as 27 in the Rigveda, 17) i. 162, 18 (the 34 ribs of the horse = moon, sun, 5 planets, 27 Nakṣatras); x. 55, 3 (34 lights). but these seem most improbable. Nor do the adjectives revatī (‘rich’) and punarvasā (‘bringing wealth again’) in another hymn 18) x. 19, 1. appear to refer to the Nakṣatras. The Nakṣatras as Lunar Mansions.--In several passages of the later Saṃhitās the connexion of the moon and the Nakṣatras is conceived of as a marriage union. Thus in the Kāṭhaka 19) xi. 3 (Indische Studien, 3, 467). and Taittirīya Saṃhitās 20) ii. 3, 5, 1-3. Cf. also iii. 4, 7. 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xviii. 14; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 40; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ix. 4, 1, 9; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iii. 12. The dwelling of the moon in a Nakṣatra is mentioned, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 5, 4, 17; Nirukta, v. 21; a Mantra in Kauśika Sūtra, 135; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, i. 11, 6; v. 12, 1, etc. it is expressly stated that Soma was wedded to the mansions, but dwelt only with Rohiṇī; the others being angry, he had ultimately to undertake to live with them all equally. Weber 21) Op. cit., 277. Cf. the later system of the Siddhāntas, Whitney, Oriental and Linguistic Studies, 2, 372, and see Tilak, Orion, 33 et seq. hence deduced that the Nakṣatras were regarded as of equal extent, but this is to press the texts unduly, except in the sense of approximate equality. The number of the mansions is not stated as 27 in the story told in the two Saṃhitās: the Taittīriya has 33, and the Kāṭhaka no number; but 27 appears as their number in the list which is found in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 22) iv. 4, 10, 1-3. and elsewhere. 23) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxix. 13, but Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 13, 20, has 28; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 1, 1-5, in lists of Nakṣatras. See also Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ix, 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 5, 4, 5; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxiii, 23; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, v. 1; Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, ii. 16; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 2, 2; Jyotiṣa, 18. 20 (verse 34 has 28, but it is interpolated); Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiv. 78, etc. The number 28 is much less well attested: in one passage of the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 24) i. 5, 2, 3. Cf. Weber, 1, 360, n. Abhijit is practically marked as a new comer, though in a later book, 25) iii. 1, 2, 6. in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 26) ii. 13, 20. and in the Atharvaveda list, 27) xix. 7, 1; 8, 1 = Nakṣatrakalpa, 10. 26. So in Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 26. it has found acceptance. It is perfectly possible that 28 is the earlier number, and that Abhijit dropped out because it was faint, or too far north, or because 27 was a more mystic (3×3×3) number: it is significant that the Chinese Sieou and the Arabic Manāzil are 28 in number. 28) Whitney, op. cit., 409-411; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 8, 390. Weber, 29) Op. cit., 2, 280; Indische Studien, 9, 446; 10, 223, 224, 226, 227. however, believes that 27 is the older number in India. The meaning of the number is easily explained when it is remembered that a periodic month occupies something between 27 and 28 days, more nearly the former number. Such a month is in fact recognized in the Lāṭyāyana 30) iv. 8, 1 et seq. and Nidāna Sūtras 31) v. 11. 12. See Weber, 2, 281288. as consisting of 27 days, 12 months making a year of 324 days, a Nakṣatra year, or with an intercalary month, a year of 351 days. The Nidāna Sūtra 32) Thibaut, Astronomic, Astrologie und Mathematik, 7. makes an attempt to introduce the Nakṣatra reckoning into the civil or solar (sāvana) year of 360 days, for it holds that the sun spends 13(1/3) days in each Nakṣatra (13(1/3)×27 = 360). But the month of 27 or 28 days plays no part in the chronological calculations of the Veda. 33) See Māsa. The Names of the Nakṣatras.--In addition to the two mentioned in the Rigveda, the earlier Atharvaveda 34) l. e., books i. xvi. gives the names of Jyeṣṭhaghnī 35) vi. 110, 2. This constellation, ‘the slayer of the oldest,’ was apparently of evil omen. Cf. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 2, 8. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 361, equates it with Antares or Cor Scorpionis, with or without , Scorpionis (Jyaīṣṭhaghnī is a misreading in the edition of Whitney and Roth). (the later Jyeṣṭhā) and Vicṛtau, 36) vi. 110, 2. It is also mentioned in ii. 8, 1; iii. 7, 4; vi. 121, 3. It is identified by the commentators with Mūla, ‘the root,’ the two stars,  and  Scorpionis, which form the sting of the Scorpion's tail; Whitney, op. cit., 48. which are mentioned as in close connexion, and of Revatīs (plural) and Kṛttikās. 37) ix. 7, 3. With reference to possible times for the ceremony of the Agnyādhāna, or ‘laying of the sacred fires,’ the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 38) viii. 1. the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 39) i. 6, 9. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 40) i. 1, 2, 1-6. mention the Nakṣatras called Kṛttikās, Rohiṇī, Phalgunyas, Hasta; the latter Brāhmaṇa adds Punarvasū, and in an additional remark 41) i. 1, 2, 8. excludes Pūrve Phalgunī in favour of Uttare Phalgunī. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 42) ii. 1, 2, 1. adds Mṛgaśīrṣa and Citrā as possibilities. On the other hand, Punarvasū is recommended by all authorities 43) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 5, 1, 4; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 7, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, viii. 15; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2, 10; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, i. 3. as suitable for the Punarādheya, ‘relaying of the sacred fires,’ which takes place if the first fire has failed to effect the aim of its existence, the prosperity of the sacrificer. 44) Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 109. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 45) viii. 15; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā. i. 7, 2. however, allows Anurādhās also. In the ceremony of the Agnicayana, or ‘piling of the firealtar,’ the bricks are assumed to be equal in number to the Nakṣatras. The bricks number 756, and they are equated to 27 Nakṣatras multiplied by 27 secondary Nakṣatras, reckoned as 720 (instead of 729), with the addition of 36 days, the length of an intercalary month. Nothing can be usefully derived from this piece of priestly nonsense. 46) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 5, 4, 5. See Weber, 2, 298, with whom Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 42, 383, n. 1, concurs. For a wild speculation, see Shamasastry, Gavam ayana, 122 et seq. But in connexion with this ceremony the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 47) Taittiriya Samhitā, iv. 4, 10. 1-3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 13, 20; Kātnaka Saṃhitā, xxxix. 13. enumerate the 27 Nakṣatras, and these lists 48) The forms and genders are given as accepted by Weber, 2, 300. The latter depend on references to the names of the Nakṣatras in other passages in some cases--e.g., Anūrādheṣu, in Kāṭhaka, viii. 15, shows that the name is a masculine in that Saṃhitā. may be given in extenso as follows: Taittirīya Saṃhitā.

Apabharaṇīs The Taittirīya Brahmaṇa 49) i. 5, 1 has a list of the Nakṣatras which agrees generally with the list of the Saṃhitās. It runs as follows: Kṛttikās, Rohiṇī, Invakās, Bāhū (dual), Tiṣya, Āśleṣās, Maghās, Pūrve Phalgunī, Uttare Phalgunī, Hasta, Citrā, Niṣṭyā, Viśākhe, Anūrādhās, Rohiṇī, Mūlabarhaṇī, Pūrvā Aṣāḍhās, Uttarā Aṣāḍhās, Śroṇā, Śraviṣṭhās, Śatabhiṣaj, Pūrve Proṣṭhapadās, Uttare Proṣṭhapadās, Revatī, Aśvayujau, Apabharaṇīs. In a later book, 50) iii. 1, 4, 1 et seq. Cf. iii. 1, 1-2. however, the list grows to 28, and the full moon is inserted after number 14, and the new moon after number 28, as an attempt to bring the Nākṣatra (lunar) month into accordance with the Sāvana (solar) month of 30 days. The names in this second list are as in the Saṃhitās with the following exceptions. The seven stars of the Kṛttikās are named as Ambā, Dulā, Nitatnī, Abhrayantī, Meghayantī, Varṣayantī, Cupuṇīkā, names found also in the Taittirīya 51) iv. 4, 5, 1. and Kāṭhaka Saṃhitās. 52) xl. 4. Beside Mṛgaśīrṣa, Invakās are also mentioned. 53) iii. 1, 4, 3. Then come Ārdrā, Punarvasū, Tiṣya, Āśreṣās, Maghās (beside which Anaghās, Agadās, and Arundhatīs are also mentioned), Phalgunyas (but elsewhere in the dual, Phalgunyau), 54) iii. 1, 4, 9. Phalgunyas, Hasta, Citrā, Niṣṭyā, Viśākhe, Anūrādhās, Jyeṣṭhā, Mūla, Aṣāḍhās, Aṣāḍhās, Abhijit, Śronā, Śraviṣṭhās, Śatabhiṣaj, Proṣṭhapadās, Proṣṭhapadās, Revatī, Aśvayujau, Bharaṇyas, but also Apabharaṇīs. 55) iii. 1, 5, 14. Abhijit, which occurs also in an earlier part of the Brāhmaṇa, 56) i. 5, 2, 3. is perhaps interpolated. But Weber's 57) Op. cit., 305, 306. argument that Abhijit is out of place in this list because Brāhmaṇa is here mentioned as the 28th Nakṣatra, loses some force from the fact (of course unknown to him) that the list in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 58) ii. 13, 20. contains 28 Nakṣatras, including Abhijit, and adds Brāhmaṇa at the end as another. In another passage 59) i. 5, 2, 7. Cf. Tilak, Orion, 41 et seq. the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa divides the Nakṣatras into two sets, the Deva Nakṣatras and the Yama Nakṣatras, being 1-14 and 15-27 (with the omission of Abhijit) respectively. This division corresponds with one in the third book of the Brāhmaṇa 60) iii. 1, 2. Cf. Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, iv. 12, with Vināyaka's note. where the days of the light half of the month and those of the dark half are equated with the Nakṣatras. The Brāhmaṇa treats the former series as south, the latter as north; but this has no relation to facts, and can only be regarded as a ritual absurdity. The late nineteenth book of the Atharvaveda contains a list 61) xix. 7, 1 et seq. The number is given as 28 in xix. 7, 1 (as emended) and 8, 2. Cf. Lanman's introductory note to the former hymn in Whitney's Translation, 906, 907. of the Nakṣatras, including Abhijit. The names here given are: Kṛttikās, Rohiṇī, Mṛgaśiras, Ārdrā, Punarvasū, Puṣya, Āśleṣās, Maghās, Pūrvā Phalgunyau (sic), 62) The reading Pūrvā Phalgunyau must be wrong; perhaps Dvaye (cf. verse 5) or Pūrve should be read. See Lanman in Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 908. The Uttare Phalgunyau are omitted. Hasta, Citrā, Svāti (masc.), 63) Svātī should, no doubt, be read; but for the Svāti (sie) of all the manuscripts (Saṃhitā and Pada), cf. the navasrakti of the Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 3, 6, with Keith's note. Viśākhe, Anurādhā, 64) See Lanman in Whitney, 908. Jyeṣṭhā, Mūla, Pūrvā Aṣāḍhās, 65) Lanman, ibid., 909. reads Pūrvā Aṣāḍhā and Uttarā Aṣāḍhā; Whitney reads Pūrvā and Uttarā Aṣāḍhās. The manuscripts have Pūrvā and Uttare, which cannot stand. Uttarā Aṣāḍhās, Abhijit, Śravaṇa, Śraviṣṭhās, Śatabhiṣaj, Dvayā Proṣṭhapadā, Revatī, Aśvayujau, Bharaṇyas. The Position of the Nakṣatras.--There is nothing definite in Vedic literature regarding the position of most of the Nakṣatras, but the later astronomy precisely locates all of them, and its statements agree on the whole satisfactorily with what is said in the earlier texts, though Weber 66) Op. cit., 2, 367 et seq. was inclined to doubt this. The determinations adopted below are due to Whitney 67) Oriental and Linguis'tic Essays, 2, 350 et seq. in his notes on the Sūrya Siddhānta.

kRttikaas|कृत्तिकास्
1. Kṛttikās are unquestionably  Tauri, etc., the Pleiades. The names of the seven stars forming this constellation, and given above from Yajurveda texts, 68) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 5, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xl. 4; Taittīrīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 4, 1. include three--abhrayantī, ‘forming clouds’; meghayantī, ‘making cloudy’; varṣayantī, ‘causing rain’--which clearly refer to the rainy Pleiades. The word kṛttikā possibly means ‘web,’ from the root kṛt, ‘spin.’

rohiNii|रोहिणी
2. Rohiṇī, ‘ruddy,’ is the name of the conspicuously reddish star, a Tauri or Aldebaran, and denotes the group of the Hyades,  Tauri. Its identification seems absolutely assured by the legend of Prajāpati in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 69) iii. 33. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2, 8; Tilak, Orion, 98 et seq. He is there represented as pursuing his daughter with incestuous intention, and as having been shot with an arrow (Iṣu Trikāṇḍā, ‘the belt of Orion’) by the ‘huntsman’ (Mṛgavyādha, ‘Sirius’). Prajāpati is clearly Orion (Mṛgaśiras being the name of the little group of stars in Orion's head).

mRgashiirSha|मृगशीर्ष
3. Mṛgaśīrṣa or Mṛgaśiras, also called Invakā or Invagā, seems to be the faint stars , Orionis. They are called Andhakā, ‘blind,’ in the Śāntikalpa of the Atharvaveda, probably because of their dimness. 70) Whitney, op. cit., 401. Cf. Tilak, 102 et seq.

aardraa|आर्द्रा
4. Ārdrā, ‘moist,’ is the name of the brilliant star,  Orionis. But the names by which it is styled, in the plural as Ārdrās in the Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra 71) i. 26. and the Nakṣatrakalpa, 72) 10. and in the dual as Bāhū, in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 73) i. 5, 1. point to a constellation of two or more stars, and it may be noted 74) Whitney, op. cit., 352, 401, n. 1. that the corresponding Chinese Sieou includes the seven brilliant stars composing the shoulders, the belt, and the knees of Orion.

punarvasuu|पुनर्वसू
5. Punarvasū, ‘the two that give wealth again,’ denotes the two stars,  and  Geminorum, on the heads of Castor and Pollux. The name is no doubt connected with the beneficent character of the Aśvins, who correspond to the Dioscuri. 75) Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 212; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 53.

tiShya|तिष्य
6. Tiṣya or Puṣya includes the somewhat faint group in the body of the Crab, , and  Cancri. The singular is rather curious, as primarily one star would seem to have been meant. and none of the group is at all prominent. 76) Whitney, op. cit., 403, n. 1.

aashreShaas|आश्रेषास्
7. Āśreṣās or Āśleṣās, which in some texts 77) Aśreṣās, Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 26; Śāntikalpa; Nakṣatrakalpa; Aśleṣās, Śāntikalpa, 2; Nakṣatrakalpa, 4. 48. is certainly to be read Aśreṣās or Aśleṣas, denotes , and perhaps also , Hydræ. The word means ‘embracer,’ a name which admirably fits the constellation.

maghaas|मघास्
8. Maghās, the ‘bounties,’ are the Sickle, or , Leonis. The variants Anaghā, the ‘sinless one,’ etc., clearly refer to the auspicious influence of the constellation. 9, 10. Phalgunī, Phalgunyau, Phalgū, 78) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, v. 1. Phalgunīs, Phalgunyas, is really a-double constellation, divided into Pūrve, ‘former,’ and Uttare, ‘latter.’ The former is  and  Leonis, the latter  and 93 Leonis. According to Weber, the word denotes, like Arjunī, the variant of the Rigveda, 79) x. 85, 13. a ‘brightcoloured’ constellation. 

hasta|हस्त
11. Hasta, ‘hand,’ is made up of the five conspicuous stars () in Corvus, a number which the word itself suggests. According to Geldner, 80) Vedische Studien, 3, 177; Rv. i. 105, 10. Cf. below, p. 427, n. 156. the ‘five bulls’ of the Rigveda are this constellation.

chitraa|चित्रा
12. Citrā, ‘bright,’ is the beautiful star,  Virginis. It is mentioned in a legend of Indra in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 81) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 4-6. and in that of the ‘two divine dogs’ (divyau śvānau) in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 82) ii. 1, 2, 13-17.

svaatii|स्वाती
13. Svātī or Niṣṭyā is later clearly the brilliant star Arcturus or  Bootis, its place in the north being assured by the notice in the Śāntikalpa, 83) 3. where it is said to be ‘ever traversing the northern way’ (nityam uttara-mārgagam).

Tilak, Orion, 204. however, constructs an asterismal Prajāpati, giving him Citrā (a Virginis) for head, Hasta (Corvus) for hand, the Viśākhe (a and  Libræ) for thighs, and the Anurādhās (, and  Scorpionis) for standing place, with Niṣṭyā for heart. But Arcturus, being 30º out, spoils this figure, while, on the other hand, the Arabic and Chinese systems have respectively, instead of Arcturus, , and  Virginis and  Virginis, which would well fit into the Prajāpati figure. But in spite of the force of this argument of Weber's, 85) Op. cit., 2, 307, 308. Whitney 86) Op. cit., 409. is not certain that Niṣṭyā here must mean a star in Virgo, pointing out that the name Niṣṭyā, ‘outcast,’ suggests the separation of this Nakṣatra from the others in question.

vishaakhe|विशाखे
14. Viśākhe is the couple of stars  and  Libræ. This mansion is later called Rādhā according to the Amarakośa, and it is curious that in the Atharvaveda 87) xix. 7. the expression rādho Viśākhe, ‘the Viśākhe are prosperity,’ should occur. But probably Rādhā is merely an invention due to the name of the next Nakṣatra, Anurādhā, wrongly conceived as meaning ‘that which is after or follows Rādhā.’ 88) Lanman in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 908.

rohiNii|रोहिणी
16. Rohiṇī, ‘ruddy’; Jyeṣṭhaghnī, ‘slaying the eldest’; or Jyeṣṭhā, ‘eldest,’ is the name of the constellation , and  Scorpionis, of which the central star, , is the brilliant reddish Antares (or Cor Scorpionis).

vichRtau|विचृतौ
17. Vicṛtau, ‘the two releasers’; Mūla, ‘root’; or Mūlabarhaṇī, ‘uprooting,’ denote primarily  and  at the extremity of the tail of the Scorpion, but including also the nine or eleven stars from  to . 18, 19.

It is probable that originally only four stars forming a square were meant as included in the whole constellation 89) Cf. Thibaut, Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 63, 156.<BR> --viz.,  and , with  and . 20. Abhijit is the brilliant star  Lyræ with its two companions  and . Its location in 60º north latitude is completely discordant with the position of the corresponding Arabian and Chinese asterisms. This fact is considered by Oldenberg 90) Nachrichten der königl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, 1909, 551, 552. to support the view that it was a later addition to the system; its occurrence, however, as early as the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 91) ii. 13, 20. which he does not note, somewhat invalidates 92) It is at the same time to be noted that Abhijit is wanting both in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā and in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā lists. that view. In the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 93) i. 5, 2, 3. Abhijit is said to be ‘over Aṣāḍhās, under Śroṇā,’ which Weber 94) Op. cit., 1, 320, 321; 2, 307; Indische Studien, 10, 224 et seq. held to refer to its position in space, inferring thence that its Vedic position corresponded to that of the Arab Manāzil and the Chinese Sieou--viz., , Capricorni. But Whitney 95) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 8, 393. argues effectively that the words ‘over’ and ‘under’ really refer to the place of Abhijit in the list, ‘after’ Aṣāḍhās and ‘before’ Śroṇā.

shroNaa|श्रोणा
21. Śroṇā, ‘lame,’ or Śravaṇa, ‘ear,’ denotes the bright star  Aquilæ with  below and  above it. Weber 96) Op. cit., 2, 382; but see Whitney, 404. very need lessly thinks that the name Śravaṇa suggested two ears and the head between. It is quite out of correspondence with the Manāzil and the Sieou, and is clearly an Indian invention. 97) Oldenberg, loc. cit.

The Śāntikalpa, 5, and Nakṣatrakalpa, 2, have Śatabhiṣā, and the latter, 1, has Śatabhiṣa (masculine). ‘having a hundred physicians,’ seems to be  Aquarii with the others around it vaguely conceived as numbering a hundred. 24, 25.

revatii|रेवती
26. Revatī, ‘wealthy,’ denotes a large number of stars (later 32), of which  Piscium, close upon the ecliptic where it was crossed by the equator of about 570 A.D., is given as the southernmost.

ashvayujau|अश्वयुजौ
27. Aśva-yujau, ‘the two horse-harnessers,’ denotes the stars  and  Arietis. Aśvinyau 101) Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 26: Nakṣatrakalpa, 9. 30. and Aśvinī 102) Nakṣatrakalpa, 4. 45; Śāntikalpa, 5. 11. are later names.

28. Apabharaṇīs, Bharaṇīs, or Bharaṇyas, ‘the bearers,’ is the name of the small triangle in the northern part of the Ram known as Musca or 35, 39, and 41 Arietis. The Nakṣatras and the Months.--In the Brāhmaṇas the Nakṣatra names are regularly used to denote dates. This is done in two ways. The name, if not already a feminine, may be turned into a feminine and compounded with pūrṇa-māsa, ‘the full moon,’ as in Tiṣyā-pūrṇamāsa, ‘the full moon in the Nakṣatra Tiṣya.’ 103) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 10, 1. Cf. vii. 4, 8, 1. 2; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 9, 1. Much more often, however, it is turned into a derivative adjective, used with paurṇamāsī, ‘the full moon (night),’ or with amāvāsyā, ‘the new moon (night),’ as in Phālgunī paurṇamāsī, ‘the full-moon night in the Nakṣatra Phalgunī’; 104) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 3. 11 et seq.; vi. 2, 2, 18; xiii. 4, 1, 4; Kausītaki Brāhmaṇa, i. 3; iv. 4; v. 1. See also Caland, U7ber das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 36, 37, and Māsa. or, as is usual in the Sūtras, the Nakṣatra adjective alone is used to denote the full-moon night. The month itself is called by a name derived 105) Primarily an adjective, with māsa to be supplied--e.g., Phālguna, ‘(the month) connected with the Nakṣatra Phalgunī.’ from that of a Nakṣatra, but only Phālguna, 106) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 9, 8. Caitra, 107) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xix. 3. Vaiśākha, 108) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 1, 1, 7. Taiṣya, 109) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xix. 2. 3. Māgha 110) Ibid.; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 8, 1, 4. For the later list, see Weber, Naxatra, 2, 327, 328. occur in the Brāhmaṇas, the complete list later being Phālguna, Caitra, Vaiśākha, Jyaiṣṭha, Āṣāḍha, Śrāvaṇa, Prauṣṭhapada, Āśvayuja, Kārttika, Mārgaśīrṣa, Taiṣya, Māgha. Strictly speaking, these should be lunar months, but the use of a lunar year was clearly very restricted: we have seen that as early as the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa there was a tendency to equate lunar months with the twelve months of thirty days which made up the solar year (see Māsa). The Nakṣatras and Chronology.--(1) An endeavour has been made to ascertain from the names of the months the period at which the systematic employment of those names was introduced. Sir William Jones 111) Asiatic Researches, 2, 296. refers to this possibility, and Bentley, by the gratuitous assumption that Śrāvaṇa always marked the summer solstice, concluded that the names of the months did not date before B.C. 1181. Weber 112) Op. cit., 2, 347, 348; Indische Studien, 9, 455; 10, 230, 231. considered that there was a possibility of fixing a date by this means, but Whitney 113) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 6, 413; 8, 85 et seq. has convincingly shown that it is an impossible feat, and Thibaut 114) Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 16. concurs in this view. Twelve became fixed as the number of the months because of the desire, evident in the Brāhmaṇas, somehow or other to harmonize lunar with solar time; but the selection of twelve Nakṣatras out of twenty-seven as connected with the night of full moon can have no chronological significance, because full moon at no period occurred in those twelve only, but has at all periods occurred in every one of the twenty-seven at regularly recurrent intervals. (2) All the lists of the Nakṣatras begin with Kṛttīkās. It is only fair to suppose that there was some special reason for this fact. Now the later list of the Nakṣatras begins with Aśvinī, and it was unquestionably rearranged because at the time of its adoption the vernal equinox coincided with the star  Piscium on the border of Revatī and Aśvinī, 115) Cf. Colebrooke, Essays, 2, 264; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 234. say in the course of the sixth century A.D. Weber 116) Naxatra, 2, 362-364; Indische Studien, 10, 234; Indian Literature, 2, n. 2, etc. has therefore accepted the view that the Kṛttikās were chosen for a similar reason, and the date at which that Nakṣatra coincided with the vernal equinox has been estimated at some period in the third millennium B.C. 117) See Weber. loc. cit.; Bühler, Indian Antiquary, 23, 245, n. 20; Tilak, Orion, 40 et seq. A very grave objection to this view is its assumption that the sun, and not the moon, was then regarded as connected with the Nakṣatras; and both Thibaut 118) Indian Antiquary, 24, 96. and Oldenberg 119) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 631; 49, 473; 50, 451, 452; Nachrichten der königl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, 1909, 564; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1103. have pronounced decidedly against the idea of connecting the equinox with the Kṛttikās. Jacobi 120) Festgruss an Roth, 68 et seq. = Indian Antiquary, 23, 154 et seq.; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 49, 218 et seq.; 50, 83; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 463. has contended that in the Rigveda 121) vii. 103 (the ‘frog’ hymn); x. 85 (the ‘marriage’ hymn). the commencement of the rains and the summer solstice mark the beginning of the new year and the end of the old, and that further the new year began with the summer solstice in Phalgunī. 121) vii. 103 (the ‘frog’ hymn); x. 85 (the ‘marriage’ hymn). He has also referred to the distinction of the two sets of Deva and Yama Nakṣatras in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 122) i. 5, 2, 8. as supporting his view of the connexion of the sun and the Nakṣatras. But this view is far from satisfactory: the Rigveda passages cannot yield the sense required except by translating the word dvādaśa 123) Rv. vii. 103, 9. as ‘the twelfth (month)’ instead of ‘consisting of twelve parts,’ that is, ‘year,’ the accepted interpretation; and the division of the Nakṣatras is not at all satisfactorily explained by a supposed connexion with the sun. It may further be mentioned that even if the Nakṣatra of Kṛttikās be deemed to have been chosen because of its coincidence with the vernal equinox, both Whitney 124) Oriental and Linguistic Essays, 2, 383. and Thibaut 125) Indian Antiquary, 24, 97. Cf. Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 464, n. 4. are prepared to regard it as no more than a careless variant of the date given by the Jyotiṣa, which puts the winter solstice in Māgha. (3) The winter solstice in Māgha is assured by a Brāhmaṇa text, for the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 126) xix. 3. This was first noticed by Weber, Naxatra, 2, 345 et seq., who pointed out its relation to the datum of the Jyotiṣa. The same date as that of the Jyotiṣa is found in a passage of the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra cited by Shamasastry, Gavām Ayana, 137 (māghe māse dhaniṣṭhābhir uttareṇaiti bhānumān, ardhāśleṣasya śrāvaṇasya dakṣiṇenopanivartate, ‘in the month of Māgha the sun goes north with the asterism Dhaniṣṭhās, in the month of Śrāvaṇa he returns south in the middle of the asterism Āśleṣa’; the sense is clear, though the text is corrupt). The passage is apparently not in Caland's manuscripts, or he would have mentioned it in his paper, U7ber das vituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 36, 37. Its date and value are therefore not quite certain. expressly places it in the new moon of Māgha (māghasyāmāvāsyāyām). It is not very important whether we take this with the commentators 127) Vināyaka on Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit.; Ānartīya on Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 19, 1; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 345. The assumption of the scholiasts seems to be due to the fact that to their minds a month must end with a new moon (amānta) or with full moon (pūrṇimānta). But there is no reason to say that in Vedic times the month may not have commenced with the new moon; the Kauṣītaki passage would thus be quite satisfactorily explained. as the new moon in the middle of a month commencing with the day after full moon in Taiṣa, or, which is much more likely, as the new moon beginning the month and preceding full moon in Māgha. The datum gives a certain possibility of fixing an epoch in the following way. If the end of Revatī marked the vernal equinox at one period, then the precession of the equinoxes would enable us to calculate at what point of time the vernal equinox was in a position corresponding to the winter solstice in Māgha, when the solstitial colure cut the ecliptic at the beginning of Śraviṣṭhās. This would be, on the strict theory, in the third quarter of Bharaṇī, 6(3/4) asterisms removed from Śraviṣṭhās, and the difference between that and the beginning of Aśvinī= 1(3/4) asterisms = 23(1/3)º (27 asterisms being = 360º). Taking the starting-point at 499 A.D., the assured period of Varāha Mihira, Jones 128) Asiatic Researches, 2, 393. arrived at the date B. C. 1181 for the vernal equinox corresponding to the winter solstice in Māgha--that is, on the basis of 1º = 72 years as the precession. Pratt 129) Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 31, 49. arrived at precisely the same date, taking the same rate of precession and adopting as his basis the ascertained position in the Siddhāntas of the junction star 130) Cf. Whitney, Oriental and Linguistic Essays, 2, 373. of Maghā,  Leonis or Regulus. Davis 131) Asiatic Researches, 2, 268; 5, 288. and Colebrooke 132) Essays, 1, 109, 110. See Sir T. Colebrooke, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1, 335 et seq.; Whitney, op. cit., 2, 381, 382. arrived at a different date, B.C. 1391, by taking as the basis of their calculation the junction star of Citrā, which happens to be of uncertain position, varying as much as 3º in the different textbooks. But though the twelfth century has received a certain currency as the epoch of the observation in the Jyotiṣa, 133) E.g., Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 606, 607, 976, and cf. Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologic und Mathematik, 17, 18; Tilak, Orion, 38, 39. it is of very doubtful value. As Whitney points out, it is impossible to say that the earlier asterisms coincided in position with the later asterisms of 13(1/3)º extent each. They were not chosen as equal divisions, but as groups of stars which stood in conjunction with the moon; and the result of subsequently making them strictly equal divisions was to throw the principal stars of the later groups altogether out of their asterisms. 134) Whitney, op. cit., 2, 375. Nor can we say that the star  Piscium early formed the eastern boundary of Revatī; it may possibly not even have been in that asterism at all, for it is far remote from the Chinese and Arabic asterisms corresponding to Revatī. Added to all this, and to the uncertainty of the starting-point-582 A.D., 560 A.D., or 491 A.D. being variants 135) Cf. Whitney, op. cit., 377, 379; Weber, op. cit., 2, 363, 364, where he prefers A.D. 582.<BR> --is the fact that the place of the equinox is not a matter accurately determinable by mere observation, and that the Hindu astronomers of the Vedic period cannot be deemed to have been very accurate observers, since they made no precise determination of the number of days of the year, which even in the Jyotiṣa they do not determine more precisely than as 366 days, and even the Sūrya Siddhānta 136) See Whitney's note on Sūrya Siddhānta, iii. 12; op. cit., 2, 369, n. 1; 374, n. 1. Cf. Tilak, Orion, 18. does not know the precession of the equinoxes. It is therefore only fair to allow a thousand years for possible errors, 137) Whitney, 384, followed by Thibaut, Indian Antiquary, 24, 98; Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 18. See also Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 236; Indian Literature, 2, n. 2; Whitney, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1, 313 et seq.; in Colebrooke's Essays, 1^2, 120 et seq.; Max Müller, in his edition of the Rigveda, iv^2, xxx et seq., was also inclined to regard the date as very uncertain; only in his popular works (Chips, 1, 113, etc.) did he accept 1181 B.C., or rather 1186 B.C, as recalculated by Main from Pratt's calculation. Shamasastry's defence, Gavām Ayana, 122 et seq., of the Jyotiṣa shows a misunderstanding the criticisms made. See Keith, ournal of the Royal A siatic Society, 1910, 66, n. 5. and the only probable conclusion to be drawn from the datum of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa is that it was recording an observation which must have been made some centuries B.C., in itself a result quite in harmony with the probable date of the Brāhmaṇa literature, 138) Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 12, 202; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaha, 20 et seq. It has been put earlier: see Thibaut, Astronomie, etc., 18; Būhler, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 55, 544, and cf. Būhler, Sacred Books of the East, 2, xl et seq.; Indian Antiquary, 23, 247; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 45 et seq. See also Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 3; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 31, who are inclined to accept an early date, fourth or fifth century B.C., for the Āpastamba Sūtras, from which a still earlier date for the Brāhmaṇas must be conceded. But Eggeling is more probably correct when he assigns the Āpastamba Sūtras to the third century, B.C. See Sacred Books of the East, 12, xl, and it seems unwise unduly to press back the date of Vedic literature. It is noteworthy that in the Epic the solstice is still in Māgha (Mahābhārata, xiii. 168, 6. 28). Reference is, however, made (ibid., i. 71, 34) to the Nakṣatras commencing with Śravaṇa, and the first month is Mārgaśīrṣa (see Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 24, 21 et seq.). Cf. also Tilak, Orion, 37, 216. say B.C. 800-600. (4) Another chronological argument has been derived from the fact that there is a considerable amount of evidence for Phālguna having been regarded as the beginning of the year, since the full moon in Phalgunī is often described as the ‘mouth (mukham) of the year.’ 139) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 8, 1. 2; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 9, 9. Cf. Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, iv. 4; v. 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 2, 2, 18; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, v. 3. 16. According to the Taittirīya and the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇas, the beginning falls at the middle of the joint asterisṃ. Jacobi 140) Indian Antiquary, 23, 156 et seq.; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 49, 223 et seq.; 50, 72-81. See Tilak, Orion, 53 et seq.; 198 et seq. considers that this was due to the fact that the year was reckoned from the winter solstice, which would coincide with the month of Phālguna about B.C. 4000. Oldenberg 141) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft, 48, 630 et seq.; 49. 475, 476; 50, 453-457. Cf. Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, lxxxvii. and Thibaut, 142) Indian Antiquary, 24, 86 et seq. on the other hand, maintain that the choice of Phālguna as the ‘mouth’ of the year was due to its being the first month of spring. This view is favoured by the fact that there is distinct evidence 143) See Weber, Naxatra, 2, 329 et seq., and cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 36; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, v. 1; a Śruti passage in the commentary on Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 2, 13; Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra, ii. 2, 4, 23. and especially Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4. 1, 2. 4. So the Phālguna full moon is called the ‘month of the seasons’ (ṛtūnām mukham) in Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, viii. 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 6, 9. of the correspondence of Phālguna and the beginning of spring: as we have seen above in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, the new moon in Māgha is placed at the winter solstice, 144) xix. 2. 3. which puts the full moon of Phalgunī at a month and a half after the winter solstice, or in the first week of February, a date not in itself improbable for about B.C. 800, and corresponding with the February 7 of the veris initium in the Roman Calendar. This fact accords with the only natural division of the year into three periods of four months, as the rainy season lasts from June 7-10 to October 7-10, and it is certain that the second set of four months dates from the beginning of the rains (see Cāturmāsya). Tilak, 145) Orion, 53 et seq.; 198 et seq. on the other hand, holds that the winter solstice coincided with Māghī full moon at the time of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (B.C. 2350), and had coincided with Phālgunī and Caitrī in early periods--viz., B.C. 4000-2500, and B.C. 60004000. (5) The passages of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 146) vii. 4, 8, 1. and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 147) v. 9. See Weber, op. cit., 2, 341344; Thibaut, Indian Antiquary, 24, 85 et seq., for a full discussion of the points raised by Tilak, Orion, 43 et seq. which treat the full moon in Phālguna as the beginning of the year, give as an alternative the full moon in Caitra. Probably the latter month was chosen so as to secure that the initial day should fall well within the season of spring, 148) Thibaut, Indian Antiquary, 24, 93. On the other side, Tilak, 198 et seq. and was not, as Jacobi believes, a relic of a period when the winter solstice corresponded with Caitra. Another alternative is the Ekāṣṭakā, interpreted by the commentators as the eighth day after the full moon in Maghās, a time which might, as being the last quarter of the waning half of the old year, well be considered as representing the end of the year. A fourth alternative is the fourth day before full moon; the full moon meant must be that of Caitra, as Ālekhana quoted by Āpastamba held, not of Māgha, as Āśmarathya, Laugākṣi and the Mīmāṃsists believed, and as Tilak believes. 149) Thibaut, op. cit., 94; Tilak, 51 et seq. Cf. also Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 1. 8-10; Weber, 2, 343, n. 2, 344. (6) Others, again, according to the Gṛhya ritual, began the year with the month Mārgaśīrṣa, as is shown by its other name Āgrahāyaṇa 150) Thibaut, op. cit., 94, 95. Cf. Weber, 2, 332-334. (‘belonging to the commencement of the year’). Jacobi and Tilak 151) Tilak's view is given in Orion, 62 et seq. It is based mainly on Amara's (i. 2, 23) āgra-hāyaṇā as a synonym of Mṛgaśiras, and on certain myths (chaps. v.-vii.); he equates (221 et seq.) Āgrayaṇa and Orion (!). think that this one denoted the autumn equinox in Mṛgaśiras, corresponding to the winter solstice in Phalgunī. But, as Thibaut 152) Op. cit., 94, 95. shows clearly, it was selected as the beginning of a year that was taken to commence with autumn, just as some took the spring to commence with Caitra instead of Phālguna. 153) A corresponding Kārttika year is not early, Thibaut, op. cit., 96. Cf. Weber, op. cit., 2, 334. (7) Jacobi has also argued, with the support of Bühler, 154) Indian Antiquary, 23, 242 et seq. from the terms given for the beginning of Vedic study in the Gṛhya Sūtras, on the principle that study commenced with the rains (as in the Buddhist vassā) which mark the summer solstice. He concludes that if Bhādrapada appears as the date of commencing study in some texts, it was fixed thus because at one time Proṣṭhapadās (the early name of Bhadrapadās) coincided with the summer solstice, this having been the case when the winter solstice was in Phālguna. But Whitney 155) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, lxxxiv et seq. has pointed out that this argument is utterly illegitimate; we cannot say that there was any necessary connexion between the rains and learning--a month like Śrāvaṇa might be preferred because of its connexion with the word Śravaṇa, ‘ear’--and in view of the precession of the equinoxes, we must assume that Bhādrapada was kept because of its traditional coincidence with the beginning of the rains after it had ceased actually so to coincide. 156) Mention should here be made of the following points: (1) Jacobi's argument from the word Dhruva, the name of the star pointed out to the bride in the marriage ritual. The word does not occur in the literature anterior to the Gṛhya Sūtras, and it must remain an undecided question whether the practice was or was not old. Jacobi urges that Dhruva means ‘fixed,’ and that it must originally have referred to a real fixed pole star, and he thinks that such a star could only be found in the third millennium B.C. Whitney and Oldenberg definitely reject this view on the ground that too much must not be made out of a piece of folk-lore, and that the marriage ritual requirements would be satisfied by any star of some magnitude which was approximately polar. This conclusion seems convincing. Cf. Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1102; 1910, 465; contra, Jacobi, ibid., 1909, 726 et seq.; 1910, 464. (2) The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2, 3, asserts that the Kṛttikās do not move from the eastern quarter, which the others do; and stress has been laid (by Jacobi, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 463, 464) upon this assertion as giving a date of the third millennium B.C. for the Śatapatha observation. But this notice is quite inadequate to support any such result, and its lack of trustworthiness as a chronological guide is increased by the fact that the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xviii 5, has a similar notice, coupled with another notice, which, according to Barth, would only be true somewhere in or after the sixth century A.D., the equatorial point being placed between Citrā and Svātī, which in the early period were both very much north of the equator (see Caland, U7ber das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 37-39). The same passage of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2, 2, in the Mādhyaṃdina recension, states that the number of the Kṛttikās is greater than that of the stars in any of the other Nakṣatras, which consist of one, two, three, or four stars, or which, according to the Kāṇva recension (see Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 282, n. 2), have four stars. It is not possible to put much faith in this assertion, for Hasta later has five stars, and its name (with reference to the fingers) suggests five (cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 368, 381), and that number is possibly referred to in the Rigveda (i. 105, 10). See Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 177. (3) Attempts have been made to regard the names of the Nakṣatras as significant of their position in the list. Thus Bentley, Historical View, 2, thought Viśākhā was so called because the equinoctial colure divided the equator about 1426 B.C.; this is refuted by Tilak, Orion, 57 et seq. Jyeṣṭhaghnī has been interpreted as ‘slaying the eldest’--i.e., as marking the new year by putting an end to the old year. Tilak, 90, suggests that Mūla was so called because its acronycal rising marked the beginning of the year when the vernal equinox was near Mṛgaśiras. More probable is Whitney's view, Sārya Siddhānta, 194, that it was the most southern, and so, as it were, the basis of the asterisms. The Origin of the Nakṣatras.--As we have seen, there is no evidence showing the process by which the Nakṣatras may have originated in India. They are mentioned only as stars in the earlier parts of the Rigveda, then the names of three of them are found in the latest parts of that Saṃhitā, and finally in the later Atharvaveda and in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās the full list appears. It may also be noted that the Vedic Indians show (see Graha) a remarkably small knowledge of the other astronomical phenomena; the discovery of a series of 27 lunar mansions by them would therefore be rather surprising. On the other hand, the nature of such an operation is not very complicated; it consists merely in selecting a star or a star group with which the moon is in conjunction. It is thus impossible a priori to deny that the Vedic Indians could have invented for themselves a lunar Zodiac. 157) Max Müller, Rigveda, 4^2, xliv et seq., maintains the Indian origin of the system. Thrbaut, Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 14, 15, admits it to be possible, as does Whitney, Oriental and Linguistic Essays, 2, 418. But the question is complicated by the fact that there exist two similar sets of 28 stars or star groups in Arabia and in China, the Manāzil and the Sieou. The use of the Manāzil in Arabia is consistent and effective; the calendar is regulated by them, and the position of the asterisms corresponds best with the positions required for a lunar Zodiac. The Indians might therefore have borrowed the system from Arabia, but that is a mere possibility, because the evidence for the existence of the Manāzil is long posterior to that for the existence of the Nakṣatras, while again the Mazzaroth or Mazzaloth of the Old Testament 158) 2 Kings xxiii. 5; Job xxxviii. 32. may really be the lunar mansions. 159) Weber, Naxatra, 1, 317, 318; Whitney, op, cit., 359. That the Arabian system is borrowed from India, as Burgess 160) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 8, 309-334. This was Weber's view also, according to Whitney, 413 et seq.; but Weber himself disclaimed it (see Indische Studien, 9, 425, 426; 10, 246, 247). On the other hand, Sédillot, Matériaux pour servir à l'histoire comparée des 'Sciences Mathématiques par les Grecs et les Orientaux (Paris, 1845-1849), favoured influence from Arabia on India. held, is, on the other hand, not at all probable. Biot, the eminent Chinese scholar, in a series of papers published by him between 1839 and 1861, 161) Summed up in his two works, Recherches sur l'ancienne astronomie Chinoise, and Études sur l'astronomie Indieune et l'astronomie Chinoise. attempted to prove the derivation of the Nakṣatra from the Chinese Sieou. The latter he did not regard as being in origin lunar mansions at all. He thought that they were equatorial stars used, as in modern astronomy, as a standard to which planets or other stars observed in the neighbourhood can be eferred; they were, as regards twenty-four of them, selecte about B.C. 2357 on account of their proximity to the equator, and of their having the same right ascension as certain circumpolar stars which had attracted the attention of Chinese observers. Four more were added in B.C. 1100 in order to mark the equinoxes and solstices of the period. He held that the list of stars commenced with Mao (= Kṛttikās), which was at the vernal equinox in B.C. 2357. Weber, 162) Naxatra, 1, 284 et seq. (1860). in an elaborate essay of 1860, disputed this theory, and endeavoured to show that the Chinese literary evidence for the Sieou was late, dating not even from before the third century B.C. The last point does not appear 163) See Chavannes, cited by Oldenberg, Nachrichten der königl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Gōttingen, 1909, 566, 567. to be correct, but his objections against the basis of Biot's theory were reinforced by Whitney, 164) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 8, 1 et seq.; Oriental and Linguistic Essays, 2, 385 et seq. For his controversy with Weber, see Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 424 et seq.; 10, 213 et seq.; Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 8, 384 et seq. who insisted that Biot's supposition of the Sieou's not having been ultimately derived from a system of lunar mansions, was untenable. This is admitted by the latest defender of the hypothesis of borrowing from China, Léopold de Saussure, 165) T'oung Pao, 1909, 121 et seq.; 255 et seq. , but his arguments in favour of a Chinese origin for the Indian lunar mansions have been refuted by Oldenberg, 166) Nachrichten, 1909, 544-572. who has also pointed out 167) Ibid., 548, n. 9. that the series does not begin with Mao (= Kṛttikās). There remains only the possibility that a common source for all the three sets--Nakṣatra, Manāzil, and Sieou--may be found in Babylonia. Hommel 168) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft, 45, 592 et seq. has endeavoured to show that recent research has established in Babylonia the existence of a lunar zodiac of twenty-four members headed by the Pleiades (= Kṛttikās); but Thibaut's researches 169) Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 63. 144-163. Cf. Astronomie, etc., 15; Oldenberg, op. cit., 572. are not favourable to this claim. On the other hand, Weber, 170) Naxatra, 1, 316 et seq.; Indische Studien, 10, 246, and elsewhere. Weber, Nakṣatra, 2, 362, 400, laid great stress on the fact that the Jyotiṣa, 8, referred to the difference of the longest and shortest day as being six muhūrtas, which makes the longest day fourteen hours twenty-four minutes: and he compared the Babylonian day of fourteen hours twenty-five minutes, and a Chinese day of fourteen hours twentyfour minutes. But Whitney, Oriental and Linguistic Essays, 2, 417, 418, shows that no stress can be laid on this argument, since the correspondence is only approximate, and the latitudes of the Babylonian and Chinese observations are approximately the same. Whitney, 171) See op. cit., 2, 418-420. Zimmer, 172) Altindisches Leben, 356, 357, where he is quite confident of the Semitic origin of the Nakṣatras. and Oldenberg 173) Op. cit., 572. all incline to the view that in Babylonia is to be found the origin of the system, and this must for the present be regarded as the most probable view, for there are other traces of Babylonian influence in Vedic literature, such as the legend of the flood, perhaps the Ādityas, 174) For the flood, see Zimmer, op. cit., 101, 357, who is opposed to Weber's view (Indische Studien, 1, 160; Indische Streifen, 1, 11) that the story preserves an old Āryan tradition, and a reminiscence of the home of the Indians beyond the Himālaya (cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 190; 2^2, 323, n. 96; Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 638, and cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 276, n. 3). For the Ādityas, see Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 185 et seq.; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 50, 43 et seq. His view is not accepted by Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 44; Bloomfield, Religion of the Veda, 133. Still more doubtful is Zimmer's view (Altindisches Leben, 363, 364) of the division of day and night into thirty parts, which he sees in Rv. i. 123, 8, and which he thinks is based on the Babylonian division of the same period of time into sixtieths. Cf. also V. Smith, Indian Antiquary, 34, 230, who argues, but inconclusively, that the use of iron was introduced from Babylonia. The facts about the Nakṣatras are (with the exception of the data from the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā and the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra) collected in Weber's second essay, Die vedischen Nachrichten von den Naxatra, 1861. The first essay, 1860, deals with the problem of origins. See also his discussions in Indische Studien, 9, 424 et seq.; 10, 213 et seq. Whitney's work lies partly in his scientific determination (in many places correcting Colebrooke's discoveries) of the later Naxatras in his edition and version of the Sūrya Siddhānta (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 6), and partly in his discussions of the question of origin (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 8), Oriental and Linguistic Essays, 2, 341-421 (with a stellar chart), and of the question of date as against Jacobi and Tilak's Orion (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, lxxxii et seq.). The views of Max Müller are found in his Rigveda, 4^2, xxxiv et seq. The modern discussion of the dates inferable from the Nakṣatra was inaugurated by Jacobi (1893) in the Festgruss an Roth, 68-74 (translated in the Indian Antiquary, 23). See also his articles in the Nachrichten der kōnigl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Gōttingen, 1894, 110 et seq.; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 49, 218 et seq.; 50, 70 et seq.; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 721727. Independently Tilak, in his Orion, developed similar views; but most of his special points are disposed of by Whitney in his review cited above. Oldenberg has discussed and refuted Jacobi's arguments in the Zeitschrift, 48, 629 et seq.; 49, 470 et seq.; 50, 450 et seq.; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1090 et seq. Thibaut has also rejected Jacobi's views in an article in the Indian Antiquary, 24, 85 et seq. See also his Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 17-19. The recent literature on the origin of the Nakṣatras consists of articles by Thibaut, Journa of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 63, 144 et seq.; Saussure, Toung Pao, 1909, 121 et seq.; 255 et seq.; Oldenberg, Nachrichten der königl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, 1909, 544 et seq. The Nakṣatras in the Epic are dealt with by Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 24, 29-36. Ludwig's views are given in his Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 183 et seq. and possibly the word Manā. 

naxatradarsha|नक्षत्रदर्श
नक्षत्र-दर्श<BR> (‘gazer at the lunar mansions’), an ‘astrologer,’ is mentioned in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘human sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 10; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 4, 1. A notice in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) ii. 1, 2, 19, and cf. the Kāṇva text in Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, xii, 288, n. 3. indicates that that work regarded the practice of choosing a particular Nakṣatra under which to set up the sacrificial fires as an idle one, because it decides in favour of choosing the sun as one's Nakṣatra.

naxatravidyaa|नक्षत्रविद्या
नक्षत्र-विद्या,<BR> the ‘science of the lunar mansions,’ ‘astronomy,’ is mentioned with other sciences in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1).

nakha|नख
नख<BR> denotes either the ‘nail’ of a man, 1) Rv. i. 162, 9; x. 163, 5; Av. ii. 33, 6, etc. or the ‘claw’ of a wild beast, such as a tiger. 2) Rv. iv. 3, 3. Cf. x. 28, 10, of the eagle's talon. The trimming (nikṛntana) 3) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 6. of the nails was a regular part of the toilet of the Vedic Indian, especially on occasions of special sanctity, when it accompanied the cleansing of the teeth. 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 1, 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 6, 2, etc.; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 3, 4. 

naga|नग
न-ग<BR> (‘not moving’), ‘mountain,’ is a word occurring only in a late book of the Atharvaveda (xix. 8, 1), and then in the Sūtras.

nagara|नगर
नगर<BR> is in early Vedic literature found only in the derivative adjective, used as a proper name, Nagarin, but it appears in the sense of ‘town’ in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (i. 11, 18; 31, 4), and frequently in the later language.

nagarinjaanashruteya|नगरिन्जानश्रुतेय
नगरिन् जान-श्रुतेय<BR> (‘descendant of Janaśruti’) is mentioned as a priest in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (v. 30), and as Nagarin Jānaśruteya Kāṇḍviya in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 40, 2).

nagnajit|नग्नजित्
नग्न-जित्,<BR> King of Gandhāra, is mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) vii. 34. as having been consecrated by Parvata and Nārada. The same king is mentioned with his son Svarjit in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 2) viii. 1, 4, 10. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 132, 134; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 515. where a remark attributed to one of them on a ritual topic is treated with contempt.

nagnaa|नग्ना
नग्ना<BR> See Dharma.

naghamaara|नघमार
नघ-मार<BR> and Naghā-riṣa. See 1. Kuṣṭha.

nachiketas|नचिकेतस्
न-चिकेतस्<BR> occurs in the well-known legend of the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 1) iii. 11, 8. (where he is a Gotama, the son of Vājaśravasa), and in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad. 2) i. 1, etc. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 154, n, 1; Weber, Indian Literature, 157; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 168. His historical reality is extremely doubtful: in the Upaniṣad he is called son of Āruṇi Auddālaki or Vājaśravasa, an impossible attribution, and one due only to a desire to give Naciketas a connexion with the famous Āruṇi. 

naDa|नड
1. Naḍa, ‘reed,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) viii. 1, 33. as growing in lakes, and in the Atharvaveda 2) iv. 19, 1. is described as vārṣika, ‘produced in the rains.’ Reeds were used, after being split, for making mats, a work carried out by women. 3) Av. vi. 138, 5. They are frequently mentioned elsewhere. 4) Av. vi. 137, 2; xii. 2, 1, 19. 50. 54; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxv. 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 4, 19; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, vi. 7, 10. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71. See also Nada.

naDanaiShadha|नडनैषध
2. Naḍa Naiṣadha is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) ii. 2, 2, 1. 2. where he seems to be 2) Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 225-227, followed by Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 338, notes 4 and 5. The printed text has Naiṣidha by error. a human king who is compared with Yama, the god of death, because of his conquests. Being there identified with the southern sacrificial fire, he was presumably a king of the south, just as Yama is connected with the south.

naDvalaa|नड्वला
नड्वला,<BR> a ‘reed bed,’ is mentioned in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (xxx. 16) and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 4, 12, 1).

nada|नद
नद<BR> is found in several passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 32, 8; 179, 4; ii. 34, 3; viii. 69, 2; x. 11, 2; 105, 4. Cf. Nirukta, v. 2. but its sense is still obscure. It is identified by Pischel 2) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 35, 717 et seq.; Vedische Studien, 1, 183 et seq. with Naḍa, being explained by him in one passage 3) i. 32, 8. Here Caland and Henry, L'Agniṣṭoma, 312, n., would read naḷam. See also Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 1, 173. as a reed boat, which is split, and over which the waters go; in another 4) ii. 34, 3, followed by Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 301 (who, however, does not construe āśubhiḥ, ‘sharp,’ with karṇaiḥ as Pischel does in Vedische Studien, 1, 190). He sees ‘reed’ also in x. 11, 2, but ‘horse’ in x. 105, 4. as a reed whip, of which the sharp points (karṇa) are used to urge horses on; and in others 5) i. 179, 4; viii. 69, 2. again as figuratively designating the penis. Roth 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. The sense of ‘bull’ seems imperative in viii. 89, 2; it is admissible in i. 179, 4, where ‘bull’ may denote a man, and in x. 11, 2, and possibly in i. 32, 8, but ‘reed’ there seems far more likely. takes the sense to be ‘bull’ (either literally or meta phorically) in all passages. Once at least 7) x. 105, 4. and in x. 11, 2. The latter passage suggests that ‘river’ may, after all, be the sense there. Cf. Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 32, 178, 215. the ‘neigher’ (from the root nad, ‘sound’) seems to be meant with reference to Indra's horse. In the phrase nadasya karṇaiḥ^8 the sense is, perhaps, ‘through the ears of the (side) horse’ (that is, by their being ready to hear the word of command) of their chariot, the Maruts ‘hasten on with their swift steeds’ (turayanta āśubhiḥ).

nadii|नदी
नदी,<BR> ‘stream,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 158, 5; ii. 35, 3; iii. 33, 4; v. 46, 6, etc. and later. 2) Av. iii. 13, 1; xiv. 1, 43. Reference is made to shallows (gādha) 3) Rv. vii. 60, 7. in the river's bed, to the opposite bank (pāra), 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 1, 6, 6. and to the bathing of horses in streams. 5) Rv. viii. 2, 2. Rivers are also mentioned in close connexion with mountains. 6) Rv. v. 55, 7; x. 64, 8. The title Nadī-pati, ‘lord of rivers,’ 7) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 4, 10. is once used to express ‘ocean’ or ‘sea-water.’

nanaa|नना
नना<BR> is a familiar name for mother, parallel with Tata, for father, with which it is found in a verse of the Rigveda 1) ix. 112, 3. Cf. Nirukta, vi. 6, and see Upala-prakṣiṇī. describing the occupations of the parents of the poet.

nanaandR|ननान्दृ
ननान्दृ<BR> is a word occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) x. 85, 46. where it denotes, according to Sāyaṇa, the ‘husband's sister,’ over whom the wife is to rule. This interpretation is confirmed by the fact that the same position is ascribed to the husband's sister--no doubt while unmarried and living in her brother's care--by the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 2) iii. 22. Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 516. The native lexicographers recognize the word, though its occurrence in the later literature is very rare (it has been noted in the Uttararāmacarita). See the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 

napaat|नपात्
नपात्<BR> in Vedic literature apparently has both the wider sense of ‘descendant,’ 1) It is equivalent to ‘son’ in a number of mythological epithets such as apāṃ napāt, ‘son of waters.’ and the narrower one of ‘grandson’ in the Saṃhitās. 2) Rv. x. 10, 1, clearly ‘son’; vi. 20, 11, may be ‘grandson.’ Most passages, vi. 50, 15; vii. 18, 22; viii. 65, 12; 102, 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 61; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxii. 2, require ‘descendant.’ In the Brāhmaṇas the word seems hardly to have the sense of ‘descendant’ at all, while it denotes not only ‘grandson,’ 3) As in Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 48; putra-naptāraḥ. ‘sons and grandsons.’ Cf. Nirukta, viii. 5. but also ‘great-grandson’ in the sequence ‘sons, grandsons, great-grandsons’ (putrān, pautrān, naptṝn). 4) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 10, 3; Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, x. 11, 5. ‘Grandson’ is also expressed by Pautra (‘son's son’) in the Atharvaveda and later, 5) Av. ix. 5, 30; xi. 7, 16; Aitarey Brāhmaṇa, vii. 10, 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 8, 3. while the sense of ‘great-grandson’ is accurately conveyed as early as the Rigveda 6) Rv. viii. 17, 13, with napāt. by Pra-ṇapāt, used beside Napāt, ‘grandson.’ Naptī, the feminine, is practically limited to the Saṃhitās, 7) Rv. iii. 31, 1 (Nirukta, iii. 4); viii. 2, 42. Cf. i. 50, 9; ix. 9, 1; 14, 5; 69, 3; Av. i. 28, 4; ii. 14, 1; vii. 82, 6. and denotes ‘daughter.’ The use in the Veda throws no light on the original use of the word. 8) Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 403-405; Lanmann, Festgruss an Böhtlingk, 77.

naptrii|नप्त्री
नप्त्री,<BR> as feminine of Napāt, is found in the Sāmaveda, Āraṇya (v. 13).

nabhanabhasya|नभनभस्य
नभ(स्) नभस्य<BR> See Māsa.

nabhaaka|नभाक
नभाक<BR> is the name of a Ṛṣi who is referred to in the Rigveda 1) viii. 40, 4. 5. and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 2) vi. 24. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 107. The Anukramaṇī (Index) attributes to Nābhāka the composition of several hymns of the Rigveda (viii. 39-42). 

nabhya|नभ्य
नभ्य,<BR> the ‘nave’ of the wheel, is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 70, 3; xii. 1, 12. and later. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 15; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 3, 20; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, ix. 4; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 3, 23, etc. See also Nābhi.

namiisaapya|नमीसाप्य
नमी साप्य<BR> is the name of a man in the Rigveda. 1) vi. 20, 6; x. 48, 9. Simply Namī in i. 53, 7. Weber 2) Indische Studien, 1, 231, 232. thinks that he is mentioned as a priest, but the passages suit a king better, and in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 3) xxv. 10, 17. he appears as Namī Sāpya, Vaidcho rājā, ‘King of Videha.’ In one passage 4) Rv. i. 53, 7. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 149; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 161; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 49. Sāpya may be read Sāyya, but Sāyaṇa recognizes the p; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutscheu Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 55, 328. he is represented as engaged in the contest against Namuci.

nara|नर
नर, नृ<BR> --The general name for ‘man’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 25, 5; 167, 20; 178, 3; ii. 34, 6; iii. 16, 4, etc. and later 2) Av. ii. 9, 2; ix. 1, 3; xiv. 2, 9; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 34; vi. 27. 32, etc. is Nṛ, while Nara 3) This form of the word, common in the post-Vedic language, is secondary, having originated from cases like naram, understood as nara-m; but its origin goes back to the Indo-Iranian period. See Brugmann, Grundriss, 2, 106. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 318, a 5. is found occasionally in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 12, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ix. 3, 1, 3; Nirukta, v. 1, etc.

naraachii|नराची
नराची<BR> occurs once in the Atharvaveda, 1) v. 31, 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 286. perhaps meaning a poisonous plant.

narya|नर्य
नर्य<BR> (‘manly’) is in two passages of the Rigveda (i. 54, 6; 112, 9) understood by the commentator Sāyaṇa as the proper name of a man. See also Nārya. 

nalada|नलद
नलद,<BR> ‘nard’ (Nardastachys Jatamansi) is a plant mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 102, 3. in the Aitareya 2) iii. 2, 4. and the Śāṅkhāyana 3) xi. 4. Āraṇyakas (where it is mentioned as used for a garland), as well as in the Sūtras. In the Atharvaveda 4) iv. 37, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 68, 69; Grohmann, Indische Studien, 9, 420; Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, 177, n. 4. the feminine form of the word, Naladī, occurs as the name of an Apsaras, or celestial nymph.

navaka|नवक
नवक<BR> is mentioned as having wished for a wife at the Sattra of the Vibhindukīyas in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa. 1) ii. 233 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 38).

navagva|नवग्व
नव-ग्व<BR> occurs in several passages of the Rigveda 1) iv. 51, 4; ix. 108, 4; x. 62, 6. as a man, an Aṅgiras in the highest degree (Aṅgirastama), 2) x. 62, 6. apparently being the type of the Navagvas, 3) Rv. i. 62, 4; iii. 39, 5; v. 29, 12; 45, 7. 11; vi. 22, 2; x. 14, 6; 61, 10; 108, 8; Av. xiv. 1, 56; xviii. 3, 20, etc. who appear as a mystic race of olden times, coupled with, and conceived probably as related to, the Aṅgirases. They are often associated with the Daśagvas. 4) Rv. i. 62, 4; iv. 51, 4; v. 29, 12; x. 62, 6, etc. Cf. Ludwig. Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 144 (B), 170.

navaniita|नवनीत
नव-नीत,<BR> ‘fresh butter,’ is mentioned frequently in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā. ii. 3, 10, 1; vi. 1, 1, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 4, etc. and the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 3, 7. 8; v. 3, 2, 6; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 3. According to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 3) i. 3. this is the kind of butter which is fitted for anointing an embryo (garbha), while the gods receive Ājya, men fragrant ghee (Ghṛta), and the fathers Āyuta. Elsewhere 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 10, 1, etc it is contrasted with Ghṛta and Sarpis. 

navavaastva|नववास्त्व
नव-वास्त्व<BR> appears in three passages of the Rigveda. In one 1) i. 36, 18. he seems to be a protégé of Agni; in another 2) vi. 20, 11. as perhaps a son of Uśanas and favourite of Indra, but in the last he seems to be defeated, or even slain, by Indra. 3) x. 49, 6. Cf. Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 2, 223; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 581; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 128, 129; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 147; Uber die neuesten Arbeiten auf dem Gebiete der Ṛgvedaforschung, 160; Perry, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, 202; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 158. But he may be a mythic figure altogether. Cf. also Bṛhadratha.

nah|नह्
नह्<BR> has been taken by Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Grassmann 2) Wörterbuch, s.v. to be the stem, meaning ‘bond,’ of the dative form nadbhyas, which occurs once in the Rigveda, 3) x. 60, 6. and which Sieg 4) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 129. thinks means ‘sister's sons.’ But the sense of this dative is probably rather ‘to the grandsons.’ 5) Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 56, 3b.

nahus|नहुस्
नहुस्<BR> occurs several times in the Rigveda, but the exact sense is not certain. Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 206. sees in the Nahus a tribe on the Sindhu (Indus) 2) Rv. i. 31, 11; vi. 22, 10; 46, 7; x. 80, 6. or Sarasvatī, 3) Rv. vii. 95, 2. Cf. ix. 88, 2; 91, 2. rich in horses, 4) Rv. viii. 6, 24. allied with the Bharatas and Śimyus, 5) Rv. i. 100, 18; vii. 18, 5. connected with Kakṣīvant and the Vārṣāgiras, 6) Rv. i. 100, 16. 17. and having as kings Maśarśāra and Āyavasa. 7) Rv. i. 122, 15. Cf. also nahuṣo viśaḥ, Rv. vii. 6, 5; x. 49, 8; 99, 7, etc. Roth, 8) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. on the other hand, sees in Nahus the general sense of ‘neighbour’ as opposed to a member of one's own people (Viś); this interpretation is supported by the occurrence of the phrase nahuṣo nahuṣṭara, 9) Rv. x. 49, 8. Cf. also viii. 8, 3. ‘closer than a neighbour.’ Nahuṣa has the same sense as Nahus in two passages of the Rigveda, 10) i. 31, 11; v. 12, 6. but in one it seems to be intended for the proper name of a man. 11) Rv. viii. 46, 27. Possibly Nahus was originally a man like Manu. 12) Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 28; Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 2, 324. But Nahus, if it was originally the name of a mythic forefather, cannot have been that of a forefather recognized by all the tribes, for there is no passage in which it applies to all men. Geldner, Ṛgveda, Glossar, 92, regards Nahus as a tribe, Nahuṣa as a king. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 128, leaves the question open. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 165, n. 7; 179 et seq.; 307 et seq.

naaka|नाक
1. Nāka denotes the ‘firmament’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 60, 10; 125, 5; iii. 2, 12; iv. 13, 5; vii. 86, 1; 99, 2; viii. 103, 2; ix. 73, 4, etc. and later. 2) Av. vii. 18, 1; xviii. 2, 47; xiii. 1, 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xv. 10; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xviii. 7, 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5, 3, 4, etc. It is often used with the epithet ‘highest’ (uttama) 3) Av. iv. 14, 6; xi. 1, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ix. 10; xii. 63. or ‘third’ (tṛtīya) 4) Av. vi. 122, 4; ix. 5, 1. 4; xviii. 4, 3. referring to the threefold division of heaven, parallel to the threefold division of earth, atmosphere, and sky (Div). The Nāka is said to be on the third ridge (pṛṣṭha), above the luminous space (rocana) of the sky. 5) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xv. 50. Elsewhere 6) Av. iv. 14, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvii. 67. In Rv. x. 121, 5, the earth and sky (dyauḥ), and heaven (svar), and the firmament (nāka), are all mentioned. the series earth, atmosphere, sky, and the firmament (nāka), heaven (svar), the celestial light (jyotis), occurs. The word nāka is explained in the Brāhmaṇas 7) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, x. 1, 18; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, viii. 4, 1, 24; Nirukta, ii. 14; and cf. Chāndogya Upaniṣad, ii. 10, 5. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 9; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 50, 56, 57. as derived from na, ‘not,’ and aka, ‘pain,’ because those who go there are free from sorrow.

naaka|नाक
2. Nāka is the name of a teacher in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 1) iii. 13, 5. Presumably he is identical with Nāka Maudgalya (‘descendant of Mudgala’), who is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 2) xii. 5, 2, 1. the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 3) vi. 4, 4. and the Taittirīya Upaniṣad. 4) i. 9, 1. 

naakra|नाक्र
नाक्र<BR> is the name of an aquatic animal included among the victims at the Aśvamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 13, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 35. Perhaps the animal meant is the crocodile, which later is called Nakra. 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 96, following one version given by Mahīdhara on Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit.; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 21, n. 4.

naaga|नाग
नाग<BR> appears once in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xi. 2, 7, 12. in the form mahānāga, where ‘great snake’ or ‘great elephant’ may be meant. In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 2) i. 3, 24. and in a citation found in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 3) viii. 22. the sense of ‘elephant’ is clearly intended. In the Sūtras 4) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 4, 1. Cf. Winternitz, Sarpabali, 43; Mac. donell, Vedic Mythology, p. 153. the mythic Nāga already occurs.

naagnajita|नाग्नजित
नाग्न-जित,<BR> ‘descendant of Nagnajit,’ is the patronymic of Svarjit in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (viii. 1, 4, 10).

naachiketa|नाचिकेत
नाचिकेत,<BR> ‘connected with Naciketas,’ is the title of a narrative (upākhyāna) in the Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad. 1) iii. 16. The word is also applied as an epithet to a special fire in that Upaniṣad 2) i. 18; ii. 10. and in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad. 3) i. 22, 11; 26, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 386. The native lexicographers give Nāchiketa and Nāciketu as synonyms of fire generally.

naaDapit|नाडपित्
नाड-पित्<BR> occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 5, 4, 13. as the birthplace of Bharata. The word may, however, be read as Nāḍa-pitī, the name of Bharata's mother, 2) Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 6, n. 3. Cf. Leumann, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 81. but this is less probable. 

naaDii|नाडी
1. Nāḍī denotes a ‘vein’ or ‘artery’ in the human body in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 138, 4; x. 7, 15. 16. and later, 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 4, 5, 2; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 1, 21; iv. 2, 3, etc.; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 6, 1; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv. 19. a natural extension of the literal sense of ‘reed.’

naaDii|नाडी
2. Nāḍī means a musical instrument, a ‘reed flute,’ in the Rigveda 1) x. 135, 7. as well as the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 2) xxiii. 4; xxxiv. 5. where in one passage it is mentioned along with the Tūṇava. 3) xxxiv. 5. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 329.

naaDii|नाडी
3. Nāḍī in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 8, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 12. seems to mean the box of the chariot wheel.

naaDiikaa|नाडीका
नाडीका<BR> occurs once in the Atharvaveda, 1) v. 18, 8. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 229; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 251; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 432. where the sense seems clearly to be ‘wind-pipe,’ with a reference also to the ‘shaft of an arrow’ made of reed.

naatha|नाथ
नाथ<BR> in Vedic literature 1) Av. iv. 20, 9; ix. 2, 17; xviii. 1, 13; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 4, 1. Also in Av. xiii. 2, 37, nātha-kāma, ‘seeking help’; xi, 1, 15, nātha-vid, ‘finding help’; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 11, 23, nātha-vindu, ‘procuring protection,’ as the name of a Sāman, or chant. appears only as a neuter meaning ‘protection,’ and is of rare occurrence. 2) In the post-Vedic literature, on the other hand, the word is a masculine, meaning ‘protector,’ and is very common. Generally, too, very little appears in Vedic literature of practices such as those which produced Anglo-Saxon society or the Roman patronatus.

naapita|नापित
नापित,<BR> ‘barber,’ is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) iii. 1, 2, 2. and later. 2) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, vii. 2, 8. 13; Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 17, etc. But the older word is Vaptṛ, 3) Rv. x. 142, 4. a derivative of vap, ‘shave,’ with forms of which verb shaving is referred to as early as the Rigveda. 4) x. 142, 4. Cf. i. 65, 4; Av. vi. 68; v 2, 17, etc. The dead were shaved before burial. 5) Av. v. 19, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 266; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 265.

naabhaaka|नाभाक
नाभाक,<BR> ‘descendant of Nabhāka,’ is the name of a Ṛṣi, or seer, in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 41, 2; Nirukta, x. 5. The Anukramaṇī (Index) ascribes three or four hymns of the Rigveda 2) viii. 39-41, and doubtfully 42. to him. According to Ludwig, 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 107. the man was an Āṅgirasa, 4) viii. 40, 12. not a Kaṇva.

naabhaanediShTha|नाभानेदिष्ठ
नाभा-नेदिष्ठ<BR> (‘nearest in descent’) Mānava (‘descendant of Manu’) is famous in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1. 9. 4-6; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 14. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 191 et seq. for the way in which he was treated when his father Manu divided his property among his sons, or they divided it: Nābhānediṣṭha was left out, but was solaced by obtaining, through his father's advice, cows from the Aṅgirases, a feat which is regarded in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 2) xvi. 11. 28-30. as on a level with the exploits of other seers who celebrated their patrons in hymns, and as giving rise to the hymn, Rigveda x. 62. Nābhānediṣṭha's hymn is repeatedly mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas, 3) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxviii. 4, merely refers to him as connected with the Aṅgirases. See also ibid., xxx. 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 30. 31; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xx. 9, 4. but beyond its authorship nothing is recorded of him. In the Saṃhitā 4) x. 61, 18. itself he seems to be spoken of as a poet in one passage, which is, however, of quite uncertain meaning. Nābhānediṣṭha is etymologically connected in all probability with Nabānazdiṣta in the Avesta, which refers to the Fravaṣi of the paoiryō-ṭkaēsha and the Fravaṣi of the Nabānazdiṣta. Lassen 5) Indische Alterthumskunde, 1, 520, and Addenda, p. lxxvii. saw in the legend a reminiscence of an Indo-Iranian split; but Roth 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 6, 243 et seq. showed conclusively that this was impossible, and that Nābhānediṣṭha meant simply ‘nearest in birth,’ and Weber 7) Episches im vedischen Ritual, 40-50. Cf. also Dāya. admits that the connexion of the words is not one of borrowing on either side, but that in the Avesta it has kept its original sense of ‘nearest relation,’ while in the Rigveda it has become a proper name.

naabhi|नाभि
1. Nābhi develops from the literal sense of ‘navel’ the figurative meaning of ‘relationship,’ 1) i. 105, 9; 164, 33; ii. 3, 9; 40, 4, etc.; Av. xii. 1, 40; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 8; xi. 12; xx. 1, etc. or, concretely, ‘relation.’ 2) Rv. i. 163, 12; vi. 47, 28; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 42-44. 50, etc.

naabhi|नाभि
2. Nābhi, ‘nave’ of a chariot wheel, is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) v. 43, 8; vi. 39, 4; viii. 41, 6. and later. 2) Av. iii. 30, 6; x. 8, 34; xi. 7, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 4; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 5, 11; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vii. 15, 1; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 2, 4; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iii. 8. See also Ratha, and cf. Nabhya.

naamadheya|नामधेय
नाम-धेय,<BR> ‘name,’ is found in the Rigveda, 1) x. 71, 1. and often in the later language. 2) Av. vii. 109, 6; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 9, 3; iii. 3, 4, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 1, 6, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 3, 11; vi. 4, 25; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 4; Aitareya Upaniṣad, v. 2, etc. See Nāman.

naaman|नामन्
नामन्,<BR> ‘name,’ is a common word from the Rigveda onwards. The Gṛhya Sūtras 1) Weber, Naxatra, 2, 316 et seq.; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 46, 47; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 152. give elaborate rules for the formation of the names of children, but more important is the distinction between the secret (guhya) and the ordinary name, though the rules as to the secret name are not at all consistent. The secret name is already recognized in the Rigveda, 2) Cf. x. 55, 2; 71, 1, as explained in Aitareya Āraṇyaka, i. 3, 3. and is referred to in the Brāhmaṇas, 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1, 3, 9 (the name is given to a child at birth); Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 25. one secret name, that of Arjuna for Indra, being given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 4) ii. 1, 2, 11; v. 4, 3, 7; Weber, 2, 317, n. 3. It is to be noted that the rule as to giving the designation of a Nakṣatra (lunar asterism) as the secret name or otherwise is not illustrated by a single recorded name of a teacher in the Brāhmaṇas. 5) Weber, 2, 318, 319. See Aṣāḍha, Rauhiṇa, Rauhiṇāyana. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 6) iii. 6, 2, 24; v. 3, 3, 14; ix. 4, 3, 3, which directs that the name should be derived from a feast performed by the person in question. See also Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvi. 4; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 17. several times mentions the adoption of a second name with a view to securing success, and also refers to the adoption of another name for purposes of distinction. 7) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 4, 4. Cf. vi. 1, 3, 9. In actual practice two names are usually found in the Brāhmaṇas, the second being a patronymic or a metronymic, as in Kakṣīvant Auśija 8) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 11, 17. (if the story of the slave woman Uśij as his mother is correct), or Bṛhaduktha Vāmneya, 9) Ibid., xiv. 9, 38. ‘son of Vāmnī,’ though the relationship may, of course, be not direct parentage, but more remote descent. 10) Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 14; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 55, n. 2. Three names are less common--for example, Kūśāmba Svāyava Lātavya, 11) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, viii. 6, 8. ‘son of Svāyu, of the Lātavya (son of Latu) family,’ or Devataras Śyāvasāyana Kāśyapa, 12) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 40, 2. where the patronymic and the Gotra name are both found. In other cases the names probably have a local reference--e.g., Kauśāmbeya and Gāṅgya. Frequently the patronymic only is given, as Bhārgava, Maudgalya, etc., or two patronymics are used. The simple name is often used for the patronymic--e.g., Trasadasyu. 13) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1, 2, 13; Hopkins, Religions of India, 201, n. 2. In a few cases the name of the wife is formed from the husband's name, 14) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 135. Cf. Weber, op. cit., 2, 316-320; Hopkins, loc. cit. as Uśīnarāṇī, Purukutsānī, Mudgalānī.

naamba|नाम्ब
नाम्ब<BR> is the name of a kind of grain mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) v. 3, 3, 8. Āmba is the form of the word in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 2) i. 8, 10, 1. and the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 3) xv. 15. 

naaya|नाय
नाय<BR> in two passages of the Rigveda 1) vi. 24, 10; 46, 11. is, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, probably a proper name. Sāyaṇa takes the word to mean ‘leader,’ while Pischel 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 41. For other explanations, see Oldenberg, ṚgvedaNoten, 1, 123, 370. considers it a gerund with passive sense.

naarada|नारद
नारद<BR> is the name of a mythical seer mentioned several times in the Atharvaveda. 1) v. 19, 9; xii. 4, 16. 24. 41. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa he appears in conjunction with Parvata as priest of Hariścandra, 2) vii. 13. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 17. as teaching Somaka Sāhadevya, 3) vii. 34. and as anointing Āmbāṣṭhya and Yudhāṃśrauṣṭi. 4) viii. 21. In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 5) i. 5, 8. he is mentioned as a teacher, and in the Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa 6) iii. 9 (the Vaṃśa, or ‘list of teachers,’ at the end). as a pupil of Bṛhaspati. In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7) vii. 1, 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 204, n. he is coupled with Sanatkumāra.

naaraashaMsii|नाराशंसी
नाराशंसी<BR> (scil. Ṛc), ‘(verse) celebrating men,’ is mentioned as early as the Rigveda, 1) x. 85, 6. and is distinguished from Gāthā in a number of passages in the later literature. 2) Av. xv. 6, 4; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 11, 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 32; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxx. 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, v. 5, 2; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 10, etc.; Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 78. The passage, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 6, 8, is uncertain. See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 98, n. 5. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 3) xiv. 5; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 98. while distinguishing the two, asserts that both are false (anṛtam). It is hardly probable that the two were absolutely distinct, for the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 4) i. 3, 2, 6. has the phrase ‘a Gāthā celebrating men’ (nārāśaṃsī). What such verses were may be seen from the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 5) xvi. 11, 1 et seq.; Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 10 et seq. which enumerates the Nārāśaṃsāni at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘human sacrifice.’ They may legitimately be reckoned as a source of the epic. 6) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 264, n. Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 100 (cf. Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 688, 689), lays stress rather on their character as mere eulogies of donors, and that, no doubt, was one of their sides; but the other elements may have been more prominent in reality than the priestly tradition shows. The term Nārāśaṃsī is restricted in some passages 7) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 32; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxx. 5. Possibly, in the other passages mentioned in note 2, the reference may be to the Atharvaveda verses, but this is not at all likely. to a particular group of three verses of the Atharvaveda, 8) xx. 127, 1-3 = Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 14, 1-3. Cf. Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 155. but Oldenberg 9) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 238. must be right in holding that the restricted sense is not to be read into the Rigveda. 10) x. 85, 6. Not even in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 11) vii. 5, 11, 2. is the technical sense certain, and the Bṛhaddevatā 12) iii. 154. Cf. Weber, Episches im Vedischen Ritual, 4 et seq. gives the word a general application.

naarii|नारी
नारी,<BR> ‘woman,’ occurs in the Rigveda 1) vii. 20, 5; 55, 8; viii. 77, 8; x. 18, 7; 86, 10. 11. and later. 2) Av. xiv. 2, 13; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 36; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 34. The word seems in the Rigveda 3) i. 73, 3 (pati-juṣṭā, ‘dear to her husband’); vii. 20. 5; x. 18, 7 (avidhavāḥ supatnīḥ, ‘not widowed, with noble husbands’), etc. to have a distinct reference to a woman as a wife, because it occurs in several passages with distinct reference to matrimonial relations, 3) i. 73, 3 (pati-juṣṭā, ‘dear to her husband’); vii. 20. 5; x. 18, 7 (avidhavāḥ supatnīḥ, ‘not widowed, with noble husbands’), etc. and in the later Vedic literature, where it is not common, it sometimes 4) Gautama Dharma Sūtra, ix. 28. has that sense. Delbrück, 5) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 417, 439. however, thinks that it does not indicate marital relations, but merely the woman as the sexual complement of the man.

naarmara|नार्मर
नार्मर<BR> occurs once in a corrupt verse of the Rigveda. 1) ii. 13, 8. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 152. regards the word as the proper name of the prince of a fort, Ūrjayantī, but Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. as that of a demon. 

naarmiNii|नार्मिणी
नार्मिणी<BR> is found in the Rigveda 1) i. 149, 3. as an epithet of Pur, ‘fort’: it must apparently either be a proper name of the fort, 2) Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 204. or mean ‘belonging to Narmin or Narmiṇa,’ some prince. 3) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Possibly the expression may consist of two words--na, ‘not’ or ‘like,’ and armiṇī, whatever that may mean. See Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 148; Sacred Books of the East, 46, 177.

naarya|नार्य
नार्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Narya,’ is the name of a generous donor in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 24, 29. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 161, 162.

naarShada|नार्षद
नार्षद,<BR> ‘descendant of Nṛṣad,’ is the patronymic of Kaṇva (i.e., a descendant of Kaṇva) in the Atharvaveda, 1) iv. 19, 2. and in one passage of the Rigveda, 2) x. 31, 11. where probably the same man is referred to in another passage 3) i. 117, 8. as a protégé of the Aśvins, and perhaps as the husband of Ruśatī. But in a third passage of the Rigveda 4) x. 61, 13. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 108, 150; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 397. the name seems applied to a demon, though this is not certain.

naavaprabhraMshana|नावप्रभ्रंशन
नाव-प्रभ्रंशन,<BR> the ‘sliding down of the ship,’ is read in Whitney and Roth's text of the Atharvaveda, 1) xix. 39, 8, where the reading nāvaprabhráṃśana is a conjectural emendātion, the manuscripts of the Saṃhitā text all having two accents, nāvaprabhráṃśana (one of them reading nāvaḥ-). and has been connected by Weber 2) Indische Streifen, 1, 11. and others 3) Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 198; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 218, n.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 30. with Manor Avasarpaṇa, the name in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 4) i. 8, 1, 6. of the northern mountain on which Manu's ship settled on the subsidence of the deluge. But both Bloomfield 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 679. and Whitney 6) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 961. point out that this interpretation is highly improbable, and this view is accepted by Macdonell. 7) Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 1107, where his acceptance of Weber's interpretation in his Sanskrit Literature, 144, is withdrawn. The expression is analyzed as na ava-prabhraṃśana by the Pada text and the commentator alike, and is never found elsewhere with reference to the descent of a boat or ship. 8) The word nau, ship, never occurs as the first member of a compound in the form of nāva, while pra-bhraṃś, ‘fall down,’ is never used of the gliding down of a boat, and would be inappropriately applied in that sense.

naavaa|नावा
नावा,<BR> ‘ship,’ occurs once in the Rigveda (i. 97, 8). See Nau.

naavaaja|नावाज
नावाज<BR> (‘ship-propeller’), a ‘boatman,’ is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ii. 3, 3, 5).

naavyaa|नाव्या
नाव्या<BR> is found several times in the Rigveda 1) i. 33, 11; 80, 8; 121, 13. and the later literature 2) Av. viii. 5, 9; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiii. 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 5, 4, 14, etc. in the sense of a ‘navigable stream.’

naahuSha|नाहुष
नाहुष,<BR> like Nahus, means, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, in some passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 100, 16; v. 73, 3; vi. 22, 10; viii. 6, 24. ‘neighbouring’ as an adjective, and once 2) viii. 95, 2. as a substantive ‘neighbour.’ If, on the other hand, Nahus is taken as a proper name, then Nāhuṣa no doubt denotes ‘belonging to the Nahus people,’ and, as a substantive, ‘King of the Nahus.’

nikothakabhaayajaatya|निकोथकभायजात्य
निकोथक भाय-जात्य<BR> (‘descendant of Bhayajāta’) is mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373. Cf. Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 444. as a pupil of Pratithi.

nigadapaarNavalki|निगदपार्णवल्कि
निगद पार्ण-वल्कि<BR> (‘descendant of Parṇavalka’) is mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. Cf. Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 443. as a pupil of Giriśarman. 

nigut|निगुत्
नि-गुत्<BR> occurs in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) ix. 97, 53, 54; x. 128, 6. where Sāyaṇa takes it to mean ‘enemy,’ a possible interpretation. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 164. suggests that non-Āryan foes are meant.

nigustha|निगुस्थ
निगुस्थ<BR> is a term of unknown meaning applied in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xvi. 29, 6) to the peoples of Kāśi, Videha, and Kosala.

nitatnii|नितत्नी
1. Ni-tatnī, ‘striking downwards,’ occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 136; probably 137 also refers to this plant. Cf. Kauṣītaki Sūtra, xxxi. 28, with Caland's note in his translation; Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 61; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 536, 537; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 383. as the name of an unknown plant which was used as a means of restoring the hair.

nitatnii|नितत्नी
2. Ni-tatnī is the name of one of the seven Kṛttikās in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 1, 4, 1). See Nakṣatra.

nitaanamaaruta|नितानमारुत
नि-तान मारुत<BR> is the name of a man in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (xxv. 10).

nidaagha|निदाघ
नि-दाघ<BR> (‘burning down’), ‘summer,’ is the name of one of the seasons in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 8, 1, 4). See Naidāgha.

nidaana|निदान
नि-दान<BR> is the name of a Sūtra, which is referred to in the Bṛhaddevatā 1) v. 23, with Macdonell's note. apparently as containing a quotation from the Bhāllavi Brāhmaṇa. The quotation cannot be verified in the existing text of the Sūtra. 2) Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 65. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 44; Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 111, etc. 

nidhaa|निधा
नि-धा,<BR> ‘net,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) ix. 83, 4; x. 73, 11; Nirukta, iv. 2. and later. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 19.

nidhi|निधि
नि-धि<BR> means primarily ‘(place of) deposit,’ ‘store,’ 1) Rv. i. 183, 4; v. 43, 8; vii. 67, 7; 69, 3, etc. and then ‘treasure’ generally. 2) Rv. ii. 24, 6; viii. 29, 6; x. 68, 6; Av. x. 7, 23, etc. In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 3) vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. The St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and Böhṭlingk in his edition, take daivo nidhiḥ as one expression. See Daiva. Sāyaṇa takes each as a separate entity, and renders Nidhi as mahākālādinidhiśāstram, presumably meaning some sort of chronology. Cf. for Nidhi as ‘treasure,’ Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 103, 104. Nidhi denotes some sort of science.

ninaahya|निनाह्य
नि-नाह्य<BR> denotes in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (iii. 9, 2, 8) a ‘water jar,’ so called, according to the commentator, because it was buried in the ground. 1) As meaning etymologically ‘to be fastened or fixed down.’ Eggeling 2) Sacred Books of the East, 26, 223, n. 4. explains it as ‘a vessel or cistern dug into the ground for keeping water cool.’

ninditaashva|निन्दिताश्व
निन्दिताश्व<BR> (‘possessing contemptible steeds’) is the name of a patron in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 1, 30. The name may suggest connexion with Iran, but such a reference is not at all necessary. 2) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 90. Cf. Ludwing, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159. Sāyaṇa ingeniously turns the name--probably a nickname-into a compliment by rendering it ‘one who puts to shame the horses of his rivals.’

nipaada|निपाद
नि-पाद<BR> in the Rigveda (v. 83, 7) denotes ‘low ground,’. ‘valley,’ as opposed to ‘hill’ (udvat). Cf. Nivat.

nimruch|निम्रुच्
नि-म्रुच्,<BR> ‘sunset,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 151, 5; 161, 10; viii. 27, 19; x. 151, 5. and later 2) Av. xiii. 3, 21; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 5, 10, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 10; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 5, 2, etc. as a division of time. 

niraShTa|निरष्ट
निर्-अष्ट,<BR> ‘castrated,’ is found in some of the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 9, 1; 17, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 4. 9. as applied to oxen, and in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) xiii. 4, 2, 5. to horses.

niraala|निराल
निर्-आल<BR> occurs once in the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 16, 3. where Sāyaṇa regards it as the name of a disease. Bloomfield, 2) Hymns of the Atharvavéda, 466. with the Padapāṭha, explains it as two words, understanding nir as an elliptical imperative, ‘(go) out,’ with the vocative āla, a kind of weed. Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 292. at first took āla to be a verbal form, but finally came to the conclusion that the expression is one word, nirāla, of unknown sense.

nirukta|निरुक्त
निरुक्त,<BR> ‘explanation’ of a word or passage, is found in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (viii. 3, 3), but does not appear as the name of a work before the later Upaniṣads. It is, however, probable that Yāska's Nirukta is not later than the rise of Buddhism. Cf. Nirvacana. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 13, 17; 3, 260 et seq.; Indian Literature, 25, 26, 41, 42, etc.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 269, 270; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 24, 25; Roth, Nirukta, xv. et seq.

niryaasa|निर्यास
निर्-यास<BR> denotes the ‘exudation’ of trees. In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (ii. 1, 5, 4) it is tabooed as food because of its red colour.

nirvachana|निर्वचन
निर्-वचन<BR> in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 1) i. 6, 3. and the Nirukta 2) ii. 1. Cf. a-nirvacanam, ‘not serving as an explanation,’ ibid., vii. 24. means ‘explanation,’ especially etymological. Cf. Nirukta.

nivat|निवत्
नि-वत्<BR> denotes ‘valley’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 161, 11; iii. 2, 10; vii. 50, 4; x. 127, 2; 142, 4. and later. 2) Av. vi. 22, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 4; 4, etc. 

nivaanyavatsaa|निवान्यवत्सा
निवान्य-वत्सा<BR> and Nivānyā in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xii. 5, 1, 4. denotes a ‘cow with a calf to which she has to be won over,’ that is, with a calf substituted for one of her own which has died. Nivānyā 2) ii. 6, 1, 6. is a contracted form of the compound term. Similar expressions are abhivānya-vatsā, 3) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 2. abhivānyā, 4) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 8, 4. vānyā, 5) Ibid., ii. 6, 16, 2. and apivānya-vatsā. 6) Kauśika Sūtra, lxxxii. 22. Cf. Lanman in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 880.

nivid|निविद्
नि-विद्<BR> denotes a brief invocation of the deity that is invited in a liturgy in honour of the god. The Brāhmaṇas 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 33. 34; iii. 10. 11; vi. 33. 35; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 9, 3, 28; xiii. 5, 1. 9, etc.; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, i. 5, 2; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, i. 3, etc. repeatedly mention Nivids as inserted in the Śastras (recitations), and the Khilas of the Rigveda 2) See Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 137-143. preserve among them a set of Nivids. But it is doubtful 3) The antiquity of the Nivids was asserted by Haug, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 1, 26 et seq., and often since, e.g., by Tilak, Orion, 206; Scheftelowitz, op. cit., 3. It is shown to be most improbable by Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 265, 355, and Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 242 et seq.; Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1907, 232, 233. whether the habit of using such brief formulas--the Nivid is usually not more than a Pada or quarter-verse in length--is known to the Rigveda, though it has been seen even there, 4) i. 86, 4; Bezzenberger's Beiträge, 9, 192. So Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 119, 122, takes Rv. i. 96, 2, to refer to the Nivids in the technical sense, but not to the Nivids as preserved. and the word Nivid is several times found in that Saṃhitā, 5) i. 89, 3; 96, 2; 175, 6; ii. 36, 6; iv. 18, 7; vi. 67, 10. but hardly in the technical sense of the Brāhmaṇas. In the later Saṃhitās 6) Av. v. 26, 4; xi. 7, 19; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix, 25, etc. Cf. Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 102; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 387, n. 2; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 241. the technical sense is common.

nividdhaana|निविद्धान
निविद्-धान,<BR> ‘containing a Nivid,’ is found several times as an epithet of a hymn or verse in the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 17; Kauṣīaki Brāhmaṇa, xxi. 6; xxiv. 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 1, 12; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, i. 2, 2; 5, 3. 

niveshana|निवेशन
नि-वेशन,<BR> ‘dwelling,’ occurs in the Rigveda 1) iv. 19, 9; vii. 19, 5. and the Sūtras. In the latter 2) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 6, etc. the word is sometimes contrasted with Gṛha as the resting-place of animals.

niShangathi|निषङ्गथि
नि-षङ्गथि<BR> 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 11; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 2. or Niṣaṅga-dhi 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 10. is found in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. If the second form of the word is correct, the sense may be ‘sheath of a sword’ (niṣaṅga), as it is taken by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, but probably the first form is the correct one, the word then having the same meaning as Niṣaṅgin.

niShangin|निषङ्गिन्
नि-षङ्गिन्<BR> is found three times in the Rigveda, 1) iii. 30, 15; v. 57, 2; x. 103, 3. where, owing to its following in one passage 2) v. 57, 2. the words sudhanvāna iṣumanto, ‘having good bows and arrows,’ the sense of niṣaṅginaḥ as ‘having quivers’ seems quite certain. In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 3) xvi. 20. Cf. Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xx, 2, 11, with the commentator. it is taken by the commentator Mahīdhara to mean ‘having a sword,’ a sense which is quite possible both there and in the other passages 4) Sāmaveda, ii. 1199; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 12; xxxvii. 11; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 3, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 2, 5. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 274. where it occurs. But the word far more probably means ‘having a quiver,’ for the bow was the Vedic weapon, not the sword (Asi).

niShaada|निषाद
नि-षाद<BR> is found in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 4, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 13; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 27; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 11; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 6, 8, etc. The word seems to denote not so much a particular tribe, but to be the general term for the non-Āryan tribes who were not under Āryan control, as the Śūdras were, for Aupamanyava 2) In Yāska, Nirukta, iii. 8. took the five peoples (pañca janāḥ) to be the four castes (catvāro varṇāḥ) and the Niṣādas, and the commentator Mahīdhara explains the word where it occurs in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 3) xvi. 27. Cf. xxx. 8. as meaning a Bhilla, or Bhīl. A village of Niṣādas is mentioned in the Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 4) viii. 2, 8. and a Niṣāda Sthapati, a leader of some kind, is referred to in the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra 5) i. 1, 12; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 13. and in a Brāhmaṇa cited by the scholiast on that passage. Weber 6) Indische Studien, 9, 340. Cf. 10, 13, 16. thinks that the Niṣādas were the settled aborigines (form ni, ‘down,’ and sad, ‘settle’), a view supported by the fact that the ritual of the Viśvajit sacrifice 7) See Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 15; Lāṭyāyana, loc. cit.; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. requires a temporary residence with Niṣādas; for the Niṣādas who would permit an Āryan to reside temporarily amongst them must have been partially amenable to Āryan influence. But the name might easily be applied to the whole body of aborigines outside the Āryan organization. Von Schroeder 8) Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 366. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 39, 119. In the later system (Manu, x. 8) the Niṣāda is the offspring of a Brāhmaṇa and of a Śūdra woman, while the Bṛhatsaṃhitā of Varāhamihira (xiv. 10) recognizes a kingdom (rāṣṭra) of Niṣādas in the south-east of Madhyadeśa. In the Pāli texts (Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 12, 160, 206 et seq.) they are wild hunters and fishers. Cf. also Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 301, 303, 366, n. 164, 403, 481. thinks that the Niṣādas were most probably identical with the Nysæans, who, according to the Greek account, sent an embassy to Alexander when he was in the territory of the Aśvakas, but this identification is doubtful.

niShka|निष्क
निष्क<BR> is frequently found in the Rigveda 1) ii. 33, 10; viii. 47, 15. etc. and later 2) Av. v. 14, 3; vii. 99, 1; xx. 131. 8; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 2, 1. 2; v. 13, 2; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 36, 7. 8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 1, 7. 11, etc. denoting a gold ornament worn on the neck, as is shown by the two epithets niṣka-kaṇṭha 3) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 22. and niṣka-grīva, 4) Rv. v. 19, 3; Av. v. 17, 14. ‘having a gold ornament on the neck.’ A Niṣka of silver is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 5) xvii. 1, 14, as worn by the Vrātya Cf. Av. xv. 3. As early as the Rigveda 6) i. 126, 2. traces are seen of the use of Niṣkas as a sort of currency, for a singer celebrates the receipt of a hundred Niṣkas and a hundred steeds: he could hardly require the Niṣkas merely for purposes of personal adornment. Later the use of Niṣkas as currency is quite clear. 7) Av. xx. 127, 3; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ix. 9, 20, etc. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 4, 1, 1. 8; Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 6; the sense of ‘coin’ is seen by Eggeling. Sacred Books of the East, 44, 50, 51, and by Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 185. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 51, 259, 263; Geldner, op. cit., 1, 268, n. 2; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 40, 127. Cf. also Kṛṣṇala.

niShkiriiya|निष्किरीय
निष्किरीय<BR> is the name of a school of priests who are mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) xii. 5, 14. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 58. as holding a Sattra, or ‘sacrificial session.’

niShTya|निष्ट्य
निष्ट्य<BR> means in the Rigveda 1) vi. 75, 19; viii. 1, 13; x. 133, 5. and later 2) Av. iii. 3, 6; Vājasaneyi, v. 23; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 4, 17, etc. an outsider or stranger. Hence the constellation usually known as Svāti (see Nakṣatra) is named Niṣṭyā in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 3) i. 5, 2, 2. 3; iii. 1, 1, 13. Cf. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 215. because it occupies a position markedly away from the ecliptic.

nihaakaa|निहाका
निहाका<BR> in the Rigveda 1) x. 97, 13. and the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 2) vii. 5, 11, 1 (following nīhāra). appears to denote some phenomenon of a storm, perhaps the ‘whirlwind.’

niixaNa|नीक्षण

niichya|नीच्य
नीच्य<BR> (‘living below’) is a designation of certain nations of the west. The Nīcyas are mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 14) as distinguished from the people of Madhyadeśa, and no doubt mean the inhabitants of the Indus and Panjab regions.

nR|नृ
नृ<BR> See Nara.

nRti|नृति
नृति<BR> in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 18, 3. seems to mean a bag of skin. But though the Paippalāda recension has the same text, it is clear that we must read Dṛti with Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Whitney. 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 294. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 235; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 468. Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 514. renders the word ‘dancer,’ which makes no sense in the context.

nRtuu|नृतू
नृतू<BR> occurs once in the Rigveda 1) i. 92, 4 (where Uṣas, Goddess of Dawn, is compared to a dancer). denoting a female ‘dancer.’ In another passage 2) x. 18, 3. Cf. 29, 2. Nṛti is found coupled with hāsa, ‘laughter,’ in the description of the funeral ritual; but though it is clear that a joyful celebration is meant (like the Irish ‘wake’ or the old-fashioned feasting in Scotland after a funeral), it is difficult to be certain that actual dancing is here meant. Dancing is, however, often referred to in the Rigveda 3) i. 10, 1; 92, 4, etc. See Weber, Indian Literature, 196 et seq. and later. Nṛttagīta, ‘dance and song,’ are mentioned in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa 4) i. 42 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 235). as found in the sixth world. See also Śailūṣa.

नृ-पति,<BR> ‘lord of men,’ in the Rigveda 1) ii. 1, 1. 7; iv. 20, 1; vii. 69, 1; x. 44, 2. 3. and later 2) Av. v. 18, 1. 15; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, vi. 3, 3; x. 77, etc. denotes a ‘king’ or a man of the ruling class (Kṣatriya).

nRmedha|नृमेध
नृ-मेध,<BR> 1) Rv. x. 80, 3; 132, 7; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 8, 3. Nṛ-medhas, 2) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, viii. 8, 21 et seq. is the name of a protégé of Agni in the Rigveda, 3) x. 80, 3. where he also appears with Sumedhas in a hymn that Griffith 4) x. 132; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 578, n. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 61. with justice declares to be unintelligible. In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) Rv. x. 80, 3; 132, 7; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 8, 3. he is an unsuccessful rival of Parucchepa, and in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 2) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, viii. 8, 21 et seq. he is an Āṅgirasa and a seer of Sāmans (Chants).

nRShad|नृषद्
नृ-षद्,<BR> ‘sitting among men,’ is the name of the father of Kaṇva in the Rigveda (x. 31, 11). Cf. Nārṣada.

nexaNa|नेक्षण
नेक्षण<BR> occurs once in the Atharvaveda, 1) ix. 6, 17. Cf. Kauśika Sūtra, ii. 11; lxxxvii. 12; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 540. where a ‘spit’ seems to be meant. In the Rigveda 2) i. 162, 13. Nīkṣaṇa occurs, and must have the same sense; Oldenberg 3) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 155. inclines to think that this word refers to the ‘inspection’ of food, to see if it is ready (as from ni-īkṣ, ‘look into’). 

nemi|नेमि
नेमि<BR> denotes in the Rigveda 1) i. 32, 15; 141, 9; ii. 5, 3; v. 13, 6; vii. 32, 20; viii. 46, 23; 75, 5, etc. and later 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 2, 15; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 5, 15, etc. the ‘felly’ of a chariot wheel. It was required to be of good wood (su-drū), 3) Rv. vii. 32, 20. and was bent into shape. 4) Rv. viii. 75, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 248. Cf. Ratha.

Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 250, 261, 527. See Ṛtvij.

naichaashaakha|नैचाशाख
नैचा-शाख<BR> is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) vii. 53, 4. where Sāyaṇa renders it as ‘of low origin,’ but elsewhere 2) See St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. he explains it as the name of a place. The former sense is accepted by Grassmann and Ludwig in their versions, and by Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 31. but Hillebrandt 4) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 14-18; 2, 241245, where he opposes Böhtlingk's view that it is a proper name. points out that the reference is rather to the ‘low-branched’ Soma plant. Cf. Kīkaṭa and Pramaganda.

naichudaara|नैचुदार
नैचु-दार<BR> occurs in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 1) xxi. 4, 13. Cf. Anupada Sūtra, vi. 4. meaning ‘composed of the wood of the Nicudāra.’ What tree is meant by the latter name is unknown.

naidaana|नैदान
नै-दान<BR> is a term applied in the Nirukta 1) vi. 9; vii. 12. to a class of Vedic interpreters. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. But of. Nirukta, Erlāuterungen, 220, 221; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2^2, 176. takes the Naidānas to be ‘etymologists,’ but Sieg 3) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 29. thinks they are the same as the Aitihāsikas or ‘legendarists.’ 4) The word seems to mean ‘one concerned with the original form’ (nidāna).

naidhruvi|नैध्रुवि
नै-ध्रुवि,<BR> ‘descendant of Nidhruva,’ is the patronymic of Kaśyapa in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) vi. 4, 33 (Mādhyandina = vi. 5, 3 Kāṇva).

नैमिशि<BR> is the epithet of Śitibāhu Aiṣakṛta in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa. 1) i. 363 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 192). It is probably to be taken as an indication that Śitibāhu came from the Naimiśa forest.

naimishiiya|नैमिशीय
नैमिशीय,<BR> 1) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 6, 4; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 363 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 192). Naimiṣīya 2) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxvi. 5; xxviii. 4; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 2, 13; Naimiṣya, Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 6 (Indische Studien, 3, 469). The cerebrals seems to be universal later. denotes the dwellers in the Naimiśa forest. They are mentioned in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 2) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxvi. 5; xxviii. 4; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 2, 13; Naimiṣya, Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 6 (Indische Studien, 3, 469). The cerebrals seems to be universal later. and the Brāhmaṇas, 2) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxvi. 5; xxviii. 4; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 2, 13; Naimiṣya, Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 6 (Indische Studien, 3, 469). The cerebrals seems to be universal later. being clearly of special sanctity. Hence in the Epic the Mahābhārata is said to have been recited to the Ṛṣis dwelling in the Naimiṣa forest. 3) Weber, Indian Literature, 34, 45, 54, 68, 70, 185.

nairukta|नैरुक्त
नैर्-उक्त<BR> 1) ‘One concerned with etymological explanation’ (nir-ukta). in the Nirukta 2) i. 12; vi. 11; xi. 19. 29. 31; xii. 10; xiii. 9. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 26, 85; Indische Studien, 2, 39, n.; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffc des Ṛgveda, 10-13; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2^2, 165 et seq. denotes a man who knows the true etymology of words, and explains their meaning accordingly. Yāska's Nirukta is the classic work of this school, and forms a commentary on an earlier Nirukta, the so-called Naighaṇṭuka, a glossary consisting of five collections of Vedic words. 

naiShaada|नैषाद
नै-षाद,<BR> a ‘man of Niṣāda,’ is mentioned in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (xxv. 15) and the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (xxx. 8).

naiShidha|नैषिध
नैषिध<BR> is the reading in the Śata atha Brāhmaṇa (ii. 3, 2, 1. 2) of the epithet of Naḍa, a king of the south. The later form of the name is Naiṣadha; the St. Petersburg Dictionarv suggests that its original form was Naiḥṣidha.

nodhas|नोधस्
नोधस्<BR> is the name of a poet who is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) i. 61, 14; 62, 13; 64, 1, and 124, 4, according to Nirukta, iv. 16. and to whom certain of its hymns are ascribed. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 18; Rv. i. 58-64 are ascribed to him in the Anukramaṇī (Index). In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 3) vii. 10, 10; xxi. 9, 12. Cf. Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 27; viii. 12. 17; Av. xv. 2, 4; 4, 4. he is called Kākṣīvata, a ‘descendant of Kakṣīvant.’ Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 110. regards him as contemporary with the defeat of Purukutsa. He was a Gotama. 5) Rv. i. 62, 13; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 125. For the controversy as to the meaning of Rv. i. 124, 4, see Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 137. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 33.

nau|नौ
नौ<BR> is the regular word in the Rigveda 1) i. 131, 2; ii. 39, 4; viii. 42, 3; 83, 3, etc. and later 2) Av. ii. 36, 5; v. 19. 8; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 3, 10, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 19; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 13; vi. 6. 21; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 1, 4; iv. 2, 5, 10, etc. for a ‘boat’ or ‘ship.’ In the great majority of cases the ship was merely a boat for crossing rivers, though no doubt a large boat was needed for crossing many of the broad rivers of the Panjab as well as the Yamunā and Gaṅgā. Often no doubt the Nau was a mere dug-out canoe (dāru). 3) Rv. x. 155, 3. It is certainly against the theory 4) Wilson, Rigveda, 1, xli. of the existence in Vedic times of an extensive sea trade that there is no mention of any of the parts of a ship, such as masts and sails, except the oar (Aritra), Yet there are some allusions indicating a trade more extensive than that implied by boats used for crossing rivers. The Atharvaveda 5) v. 19, 8. Cf. Hopkins, American Journal of Philology, 19, 139. So perhaps the passage, Rv. i. 32, 8, nadaṃ na bhinnam, refers to a ship. See Naḍa. compares the ruin of a kingdom where Brahmins are oppressed to the sinking of a ship which is leaking (bhinnā); though the language here employed can be made to fit the theory that the ship was only a canoe, it cannot naturally be so interpreted. Moreover, there is mention made in the Rigveda 6) Rv. i. 56, 2; iv. 55, 6. of men who go to the ocean (Samudra) eager for gain (saniṣyavaḥ). It is not altogether satisfactory to restrict such references with Zimmer 7) Altindisches Leben, 22, 23. to the broad stream of the Indus after the union of that river with the tributaries of the Panjab. In the Rigveda 8) i. 116, 3 et seq. too it is said that the Aśvins rescued Bhujyu in the ocean with a ship of a hundred oars (śatāritra). It is not easy to refuse to recognize here the existence of larger vessels with many oars used for sea voyages. The Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra, 9) i. 2, 4; ii. 2, 2. But it is not of very early date. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 255-257. at any rate, clearly refers to maritime navigation. See also Samudra.

nyagrodha|न्यग्रोध
न्यग्-रोध,<BR> ‘growing downwards,’ is the name of the Ficus indica, a tree remarkable for sending down from its branches fibres which take root and form new stems. Though the tree is not mentioned by name in the Rigveda, it appears to have been known, as Pischel 1) Vedische Studien, 1, 113, 114. has shown from a hymn 2) i. 24, 7, where stūpa seems to denote the crest or crown of the tree above the main trunk. in which its characteristics may be recognized. It is frequently mentioned in the Atharvaveda 3) iv. 37, 4; v. 5, 5. and the later literature. 4) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 30. 31; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 5, 13 xiii. 2, 7, 3; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 12, 1, etc. The sacrificial bowls (Camasa) were made of its wood. 5) Taittirīya Samhitā, vii. 4, 12, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 13. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 58. It was doubtless of the greatest importance, as in modern times, to the Vedic village. The sister tree, the Aśvattha (Ficus religiosa), already occurs in the Rigveda.

nyanka|न्यङ्क
न्य्-अङ्क<BR> in the dual denotes in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) i. 7, 7, 2. and Brāhmaṇa 2) i. 3, 5, 4; ii. 7, 8, 1. some part of the chariot, parallel with Aṅka. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 3) i. 7, 5; Lāṭyāyana Srauta Sūtra, ii. 8, 9. has Nyaṅkū, the dual of Nyaṅku. 

nyanku|न्यङ्कु
न्यङ्कु<BR> is the name of an animal in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 17, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 9; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 27. 32. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83. The metre nyaṅku-sāriṇī, ‘with a gazelle's gait,’ is already mentioned in the Ṛgveda Prātiśākhya, xvi. 31; Chandas, 5; Nidāna Sūtra, i. 2. It seems clear that a kind a ‘gazelle’ is meant, but the commentary on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 17, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 9; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 27. 32. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83. The metre nyaṅku-sāriṇī, ‘with a gazelle's gait,’ is already mentioned in the Ṛgveda Prātiśākhya, xvi. 31; Chandas, 5; Nidāna Sūtra, i. 2. suggests ‘bear’ (ṛkṣa) as a variant rendering.

nyastikaa|न्यस्तिका
न्य्-अस्तिका<BR> seems in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 139, 1. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 385; Bloomfield, ymns of the Atharvaveda, 539, 540. to denote a plant of some kind, identified by the scholiast with the Śaṅkhapuṣpikā (Andropogon aciculatus).

nyochanii|न्योचनी
न्य्-ओचनी<BR> is found in the marriage hymn of the Rigveda (x. 85, 6), where some kind of ornament worn by women seems to be meant. The commentator Sāyaṇa interprets it as ‘female slave.’ P.

pakti|पक्ति
पक्ति<BR> denotes a cooked object, probably a kind of ‘cake,’ in the Saṃhitās. 1) Rv. iv. 24, 5. 7; 25, 6. 7; vi. 29, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 59, etc. One who cooks food is called Paktṛ. 2) Av. x. 9, 7. 11. 25; xi. 1, 17; xii. 3, 17; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 4, 17; x. 4, 2, 19.

paktha|पक्थ
पक्थ<BR> is the name of a people in the Rigveda, 1) vii. 18. 7. where they appear as one of the tribes that opposed 2) Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 95, thought that the Pakthas were allies of the Trtsus, but this view is certainly incorrect. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 260. the Tṛtsu-Bharatas in the Dāśarājña. or ‘battle of the ten kings.’ Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 430, 431. compares them with the tribe of  and their country , mentioned as in the north-west of India by Herodotus, 4) vii. 65 (); iii. 102 and iv. 44 (). and with the modern Pakhthūn in Eastern Afghanistan, holding that they were a northern tribe; this is probable, since the Bharatas seem to have occupied the Madhyadeśa, or ‘Middle Land.’ In three passages of the Rigveda 5) viii. 22, 10; 49, 10; x. 61, 1. a Paktha is referred to as a protégé of the Aśvins. The second connects him with Trasadasyu, whose tribe, the Pūrus, were aided by the Pakthas in their unsuccessful onslaught on Sudās. In the third passage he seems specified as Tūrvāyaṇa, and appears as an opponent of Cyavāna. 6) Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 71-77. Probably, therefore, Paktha in all cases denotes the king of the Paktha people.

pakva|पक्व
पक्व,<BR> ‘cooked,’ is used substantively as meaning ‘cooked food’ 1) Rv. vi. 63, 9; Av. vi. 119, 2; xii. 3, 55; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 1, 26; ii. 6, 1, 7, etc. or ‘cooked milk.’ 2) Rv. i. 62, 9; 180, 3; ii. 40, 2; iii. 30, 14; vi. 44, 24, etc. The word is also used of ‘baked’ bricks. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1, 2, 22; vii. 2, 1, 7.

paxa|पक्ष
पक्ष<BR> is, in the Atharvaveda, 1) ix. 3, 4. applied to some part of a house, either the ‘side posts,’ according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 153. and Grill, 4) Hundert Lieder^2, 188. or ‘sides,’ as understood by Whitney 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 526. and Bloomfield. 6) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 597. The description of the roof (Chadis) in the Atharvaveda 7) iii. 7, 3. as catuṣ-pakṣa, ‘four-sided,’ tells in favour of the second explanation. In the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 8) i. 5, 12, 5. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 210. Pakṣa is used of the sides of a chariot. For Pakṣa as the ‘half’ of a month, see Māsa. 

paxas|पक्षस्
पक्षस्<BR> is found in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 8, 22. and the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 2) vii. 7. meaning the ‘sides’ 3) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 506; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 117. of a chariot. In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 4) xxx. 5. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 5) i. 2, 3, 1. it is used of the sides of a hut or chamber (Śālā). In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 6) xxix. 5. it means the ‘wing’ of a door. In the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 7) ii. 9. the ‘half’ of an army is so named, and in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 8) xxiii. 6, 6. it means the ‘half’ of a month, or ‘fortnight.’ Cf. Pakṣa.

paxin|पक्षिन्
पक्षिन्<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 48. 5; 182, 5; x. 127, 5, etc. and later 2) Av. iv. 34, 4; xi. 5, 21; xii. 1, 51; xiii. 2, 33; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 8; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 23; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 5, 18, etc. denotes a ‘winged’ creature, more particularly a ‘bird.’

pankti|पङ्क्ति
पङ्क्ति,<BR> originally a ‘set of five,’ denotes as early as the Rigveda 1) x. 117, 8, as taken by the St. Petersburg Dictionary. a ‘series’ generally. In the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 2) x. 38, 39. the word is used of the series of a man's ancestors whom he purifies by certain conduct.

pachata|पचत
पचत,<BR> like Pakti, denotes ‘cooked food’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 61, 7; x. 116, 8. and later. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 60; xxiii. 13; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, viii. 21, etc.

pachana|पचन
पचन<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 162, 6. and the Śatapatha Brāhamaṇa 2) vi. 5, 43, 3. 4; xiv. 1, 2, 21. denotes a ‘vessel for cooking’ food. 

pajra|पज्र
पज्र<BR> is the name of the family from which Kakṣīvant sprang (Pajriya). It is mentioned several times in the Rigveda. 1) i. 117, 10; 122, 7. 8; 126, 4. 5. According to Pischel, 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 97, 98. the epithet pṛkṣa-yāma 3) Rv. i. 127, 8, where Roth (St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.) thinks this compound is probably a proper name. applied to them means ‘carrying out brilliant sacrificial performances,’ which won for them Śrutaratha's generosity. In two passages 4) Rv. viii. 4, 17; 6, 47. Roth 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. pajra. sees a Pajra called Sāmaṅ. This is uncertain, but in any case a Pajra seems clearly alluded to. Elsewhere 6) Rv. i. 190, 5, where the reference is clearly hostile and contemptuous. it is very doubtful whether the word is a proper name at all. In the Śāṭyāyana 7) Cited by Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 51, 4. the Pajras are declared to be Aṅgirases.

pajraa|पज्रा
पज्रा<BR> occurs once in the Rigveda, 1) ix. 82, 14. where Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 110. sees in the word the name of the wife of the sacrificer, Pajra, while Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. pajra. takes it to be an epithet (‘stout’) of the Soma plant. The sense is thus uncertain.

pajriya|पज्रिय
पज्रिय<BR> ‘descendant of Pajra,’ is the patronymic 1) Cf. Tugrya, n. 1. of Kakṣīvant in the Rigveda. 2) i. 116, 7; 117, 6; 120, 5.

pancajanaaH|पञ्चजनाः
पञ्च-जनाः,<BR> the ‘five peoples,’ are mentioned under various names in Vedic literature. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 31; iv. 27; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 1, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, v. 6; xxxii. 6; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 2, 9 (pañca-janāḥ as a compound). See also pañca mānuṣāḥ, Rv. viii. 9, 2; mānavāḥ, Av. iii. 21, 5; 24, 3; xii. 1, 15; janāḥ, Rv. iii. 37, 9; 59, 8; vi. 14, 4; viii. 32, 22; ix. 65, 23; 92, 3; x. 45, 6; kṛṣṭayaḥ, ii. 2, 10; iii. 53, 16; iv. 38, 10; x. 60, 4; 119, 6; Av. iii. 24, 3; kṣitayaḥ, Rv. i. 7, 9; 176, 3; v. 35, 2; vi. 46, 7; vii. 75, 4; 79, 1; carṣaṇyaḥ, Rv. v. 86, 2; vii. 15, 2; ix. 101, 9. See Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 204. Every book of the Rigveda has a mention of the five peoples: one such in ii. and iv.; two in i., v., vi., vii., viii.; three in iii. and ix.; four in x. Who are meant by the five is very uncertain. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 2) iii. 31. explains the five to be gods, men, Gandharvas and Apsarases, snakes, and the Fathers. Aupamanyava 3) In Yāska, Nirukta, iii. 8. held that the four castes (Varṇa) and the Niṣādas made up the five, and Sāyaṇa 4) On Rv. i. 7, 9, etc. is of the same opinion. Yāska 5) Nirukta, loc. cit. thinks that the five are the Gandharvas, fathers, gods, Asuras, and Rakṣases. No one of these explanations can be regarded as probable. Roth 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. kṛṣṭi, Nirukta, Erläuterungen, 28. For his view, Av. iii. 24, 3, can be cited: pañca pradiśo mānavīḥ pañca kṛṣṭayaḥ, ‘the five directions, the five races of men.’ and Geldner 7) Siebenzig Lieder, 18. See, however, Ṛgveda, Glossar, 103, where he recognizes the use of the phrase to denote five tribes, as well as all mankind. think that all the peoples of the earth are méant: just as there are four quarters (Diś), there are peoples at the four quarters (N. E. S. W.), with the Āryan folk in the middle. Zimmer 8) Altindisches Leben, 119-123. His view is accepted by Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 153; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 179, is doubtful. opposes this view on the ground that the inclusion of all peoples in one expression is not in harmony with the distinction so often made between Āryan and Dāsa; that neither janāsaḥ, ‘men,’ 9) Cf. its use in Rv. ii. 12, sa janāsa Indraḥ, where the address must be to Āryan men. nor mānuṣāḥ, ‘people,’ 10) Cf. Rv. viii. 9, 2, and i. 52, 9, with viii. 70, 11; x. 28, 8. could be used of non-Āryans; that the Soma is referred to as being among the five tribes; 11) Rv. ix. 65, 23. that the five tribes are mentioned as on the Sarasvatī, 12) Rv. vi. 61, 12 (pañca jātā). Cf. x. 53, 4. and that Indra is pāñcajanya, 13) v. 32, 11. Agni is ‘of the five tribes,’ Rv. ix. 66, 20. Atri also is so described, Rv. i. 117, 3. ‘belonging to the five peoples.’ He concludes that Āryans alone are meant, and in particular the five tribes of the Anus, Druhyus, Yadus, Turvaśas, and Pūrus, who are all mentioned together in one or perhaps two hymns of the Rigveda, 14) Rv. i. 108, 8. In vii. 18, cited by Zimmer, 122, the five tribes do not occur eo nomine, for Yakṣu replaces Yadu. But it is probable that Yadu is meant by Yakṣu. and four of whom occur in another hymn. 15) Rv. viii. 10, 5. But he admits that the expression might easily be used more generally later. Hopkins 16) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 260. has combated Zimmer's view, but his own opinion rests mainly on his theory that there was no people named Turvaśa, but only a king of the Yadus called Turvaśa, and that theory is not very probable. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 17) xiii. 5, 4, 14. and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 18) viii. 23. the five peoples are opposed to the Bharatas, and in the former work 19) It is a conjecture of Weber's, Indische Studien, 1, 202, that the five peoples are identical with the Pañcālas, and the seven mentioned in Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 23, with the Kuru-Pañcālas. seven peoples are alluded to.

pancadashii|पञ्चदशी
पञ्च-दशी,<BR> ‘the fifteenth day of the month,’ is already mentioned in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (i. 5, 10, 5).

pancanada|पञ्चनद
पञ्च-नद,<BR> ‘having five streams,’ is not found until the epic period as the name of the Panjāb, which has no designation in the earlier literature. The importance of the Panjāb as the home 1) See, e.g., Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 32 et seq. of the Rigveda has been greatly diminished by recent research, Hopkins, 2) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 19-28. Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 145, 441. Pischel, 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 218. and Geldner 4) Ibid., 3, 152. having on different grounds shown reason for believing that the Rigveda, at least in great part, was composed farther east, in the Madhyadeśa, which admittedly was the home of the later Vedic culture. Hillebrandt 5) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 98 et seq. But see Divodāsa. Cf. also Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 189. considers that the Rigveda belongs in part to the Panjāb, or rather to Arachosia, and in part to the Middle Country. See also Kuru, Tṛtsu.

pancaviMshabraahmaNa|पञ्चविंशब्राह्मण
पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण<BR> See Tāṇdya.

pancaala|पञ्चाल
पञ्चाल<BR> is the later name 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 7. of the people called Krivi in the Rigveda. The Pañcālas are rarely referred to except in connexion with the Kurus, and the kings of the Kuru-Pañcālas are mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 2) viii. 14 In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 3) xxx. 2 (Indische Studien, 3, 471). the Pañcālas appear as the people of Keśin Dālbhya. In the Upaniṣads and later 4) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 1 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 2, 1 Kāṇva); Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 3, 1; Ṛgveda Prātiśākhya, ii. 12, 44; Nidāna Sūtra, i. 6; Sāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 13, 6, etc. the Brahmins of the Pañcālas figure as taking part in philosophical and philological discussions. The Saṃhitopaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 5) 2. Cf. Indische Studien, 4, 375, n.; 8, 92, n. 1. makes mention of the Prācya-Pañcālas. The Pañcālas, no doubt, included other tribes besides the Krivis. The name seems to refer to five tribes, and it has been suggested 6) Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 202; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 108, n. 1. Cf. Weber, op. cit., 1, 191 et seq.; Indian Literature, 10, 90, 114, 115, 125, 135, 136. that the Pañcālas represent the five tribes of the Rigveda, but the suggestion is not very probable. There is no trace in Vedic literature of the Epic division of the Pañcālas into northern (uttara) and southern (dakṣiṇa). The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 7) xiii. 5, 4, 7. mentions their town Paricakrā; other towns to which allusion seems to be made were Kāmpīla and kauśāmbī. 8) See Kauśāmbeya. Of their kings and chiefs, as distinguished from kings of the Kuru-Pañcālas, we hear of Kraivya, Durmukha, Pravāhaṇa Jaivali, and Śona.

pancaalachaNDa|पञ्चालचण्ड
पञ्चाल-चण्ड<BR> is the name of a teacher in the Aitareya 1) iii. 1, 6. and the Śāṅkhāyana 2) vii. 18. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 391; Indian Literature, 50, 315, 326. Āraṇyakas.

pancaavi|पञ्चावि
पञ्चावि<BR> occurs several times in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 1) xviii. 26; xxi. 14; xxiv. 12; xxviii. 26. in the sense of ‘aged five lamb-periods’ (of six months), that is, ‘thirty months old.’ 2) Cf. Tryavi.

pancaudana|पञ्चौदन
पञ्चौदन<BR> is an adjective in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 14, 7; ix. 5, 8 et seq. meaning ‘prepared with five rice-messes.’ The cooking of five rice dishes is referred to in the same Saṃhitā. 2) ix. 5, 37. 

paTala|पटल
पटल<BR> as early as the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) i. 21. 22. denotes ‘section’ of a work, a sense occurring in the Sūtras 2) Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xi. 9. 20; xiii. 21, 2; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 6. 7. and later.

paTharvan|पठर्वन्
पठर्वन्<BR> appears to be the name of a man in the Rigveda. 1) i. 112, 17, with Sāyaṇa's note. According to Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 204. Cf. Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 147, 148. however, the word is Paṭharu, and is the name of a fort which was saved by a rain-storm from being set on fire.

paDgRbhi|पड्गृभि
पड्गृभि,<BR> ‘seizing by the foot,’ 1) But it may mean ‘seizing with a cord.’ Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 34 (top); Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 236. is the name in the Rigveda 2) x. 49, 5. of either a man 3) Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165. or a demon. See also Paḍbīśa.

paDbiisha|पड्बीश
पड्-बीश,<BR> the ‘foot-fetter’ of a horse in five passages, two in the Rigveda, 1) i. 162, 14. 16 = Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 6, 9, 1. 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxv. 38. 39. and one each in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 2) vi. 2, 13 (Mādhyaṃdina). the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 3) v. 1, 12. and the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka. 4) ix. 7; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 57, n. 3. Elsewhere 5) Rv. x. 97, 16; Av. viii. 1, 4; xii. 5, 15; xvi. 8, 27; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 10, 3; Mantra Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 10. its uses are metaphorical. According to Roth, 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. the literal sense is ‘foot-fastening’ (paḍ being = pad, ‘foot,’ and bīśa, written vīśa in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, being connected with the Latin vincire, ‘bind’). Pischel 7) Vedische Studien, 1, 233-236. objects that the sense of ‘foot-fastening’ involves the absurdity, in the Upaniṣad passages, of a fine horse from the Sindhu (Indus) being spoken of as tearing up the peg to which it is fastened. He suggests instead the meaning of ‘hobble,’ which must be right. 8) He explains the first part of the word as derived from paś, ‘tie.’ Cf. Macdoneli, Vedic Grammar, p. 34 (top). But the form paḍ may be due to a false analogy, and the sense of ‘footfastener’ may express ‘hobble’ quite satisfactorily; it is not confined to a rope tied to a peg in the ground. 

paNa|पण
पण,<BR> with Pratipaṇa, is found in a hymn of the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 15, 4. 6 (in the Paippalāda recension; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 112). denoting the process of bargaining and selling. The root paṇ, from which the word is derived, is employed in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas, 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, viii. 55; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 3, 1 et seq.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 27. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 10, 1. while Paṇana in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3) iii. 3, 2, 19. The root does not occur in the Rigveda, but its etymology is vouched for by the Greek , Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 84, n. 3. denotes ‘trafficking.’ Cf. Vaṇij.

paNi|पणि
पणि<BR> in the Rigveda appears to denote a person who is rich, but who does not give offerings to the gods, or bestow Dakṣiṇās on the priests, and who is therefore an object of intense dislike to the composers of the Saṃhitā. 1) Rv. i. 33, 3; 83, 2; 151, 9; 180, 7; iv. 28, 7; v. 34, 5-7; 61, 8; vi. 13, 3; 53, 3; viii. 64, 2; 97, 2; x. 60, 6; Av. v. 11, 7; xx. 128, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxv. 1. Hence the gods are asked to attack the Paṇis, who are also referred to as being defeated with slaughter. 2) Rv. 1, 83, 4; 184, 2; iii. 58, 2; v. 34, 7; 61, 8; vi. 13, 3; 20, 4; 33, 2; viii. 64, 11. The Paṇi is opposed to the pious sacrificer as a niggard, 3) Rv. i. 124, 10; iv. 51, 3; viii. 45, 14 (where the sense is doubtful). Cf. i. 93, 4; v. 61, 1. and is spoken of as a wolf, 4) Rv. vi. 51, 14. the symbol of enmity. In some passages 5) Rv. i. 32, 11; ii. 24, 6; iv. 58, 4; vi. 44, 22; vii. 9, 2; x. 67, 6; 92, 3; Av. iv. 23, 5; xix. 46, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 8, 2, 3. It is impossible definitely to decide in which passages the mythical sense is meant, Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 157. the Paṇis definitely appear as mythological figures, demons who withhold the cows or waters of heaven, and to whom Saramā goes on a mission from Indra. 6) Rv. x. 108. Among the Paṇis Bṛbu was apparently important. In one passage of the Rigveda 7) Rv. viii. 66, 10. they are described as Bekanāṭas, or ‘usurers’ (?). In another 8) Rv. vii. 6, 3. they are called Dasyus, and styled mṛdhra-vāc, probably ‘of hostile speech,’ and grathin, a word of uncertain meaning. Hillebrandt 9) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 89. thinks that the latter epithet refers to the continuous flow of a speech which is not understood, and that mṛdhra-vāc means ‘śpeaking an enemy's speech,’ though not necessarily with reference to non-Āryans. 10) See Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 1, 23; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2^2, 114; Davidson, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 37, 23; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 31, n. 3. In two passages 11) Rv. v. 34, 5-7; Av. v. 11, 6. the Paṇis appear as Dāsas, and in one 12) Rv. v. 61, 8. Cf. Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 41, 673; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 361, who thinks that the Paṇi is compared unfavourably with a generous woman, but this is unlikely; Hillebrandt, 1, 92, n. 3; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 58, 59 Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 364. a Paṇi is mentioned in connexion with wergeld (Vaira), being apparently regarded as equal to a man merely in the price put on his life, but in other respects as inferior. It is difficult to be certain exactly who a Paṇi was. Roth 13) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Yāska, Nirukta, ii. 17; vi. 26. thinks that the word is derived from paṇ, ‘barter,’ and that the Paṇi is properly the man who will give nothing without return, hence the niggard, who neither worships the gods nor rewards their priests. This view is accepted by Zimmer 14) Altindisches Leben, 257. Cf. Macdonell, loc. cit.; Geldner, Ṛgveda, Glossar, 103. and by Ludwig. 15) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 213215. Cf. Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 2, 319. The latter scholar thinks the apparent references to fights with Paṇis are to be explained by their having been aboriginal traders who went in caravans--as in Arabia and Northern Africa--prepared to fight, if need be, to protect their goods against attacks which the Āryans would naturally deem quite justified. He supports this explanation by the references to the Paṇis as Dasyus and Dāsas. It is, however, hardly necessary to do more than regard the Paṇis generally as non-worshippers of the gods favoured by the singers; the term is wide enough to cover either the aborigines or hostile Āryan tribes, as well as demons. Hillebrandt, 16) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 83 et seq.; 3, 268; Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1894, 648. however, thinks that a real tribe is meant, the Parnians of Strabo, and that they were associated with the Dahae (Dāsa). Moreover, he finds them associated in one passage 17) Rv. vi. 61, 1-3. with the Pārāvatas, whom he identifies with the  of Ptolemy, 18) vi. 20, 3. and with Bṛṣaya, whom he connects with  of Arrian; 19) iii. 8, 4. he also considers that the frequent 20) The Paṇis occur twelve times in Maṇḍala vi.; once each in ii. and viii.; twice in v. and ix.; thrice in iv. and vii.; six times in viii.; nine times in i.; and four times in x., besides the references in the Saramā hymn, x. 108. mention of the Paṇis as opponents of Divodāsa shows that the latter was on the Arachosian Haraqaiti (Sarasvatī) fighting against the Parnians and Dahae, as well as other Iranian tribes. But the identification of Paṇi and the Parnians is needless, especially as the root paṇ, which is found also in the Greek , shows a satisfactory derivation, while the transfer of Divodāsa to the Haraqaiti is improbable. See also Divodāsa and Bekanāṭa.

paNDita|पण्डित
पण्डित,<BR> a ‘learned man,’ is not found until the Upaniṣad period. 1) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 4, 1; vi. 4, 16. 17; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 14, 2; Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad, i. 2, 8, etc.

patanga|पतङ्ग
1. Pataṅga, ‘flying,’ denotes a ‘winged insect’ in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 50, 1. and the Upaniṣads. 2) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 19 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 2, 14 Kāṇva); 2, 14 (= 1, 14); Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 9, 3; 10, 2; vii. 2, 1; 7, 1; 8, 1; 10, 1; Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa, vi. 5 (Indische Studien, 1, 40).

patangapraajaapatya|पतङ्गप्राजापत्य
2. Pataṅga Prājāpatya (‘descendant of Prajāpati’) is credited by the Anukramaṇī (Index) with the authorship of a hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 177, 1. in which Pataṅga means the ‘sun-bird.’ He is also mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 2) iii. 30, 1. Cf. Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 8; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xi. 14, 28.

patancalakaapya|पतञ्चलकाप्य
पतञ्चल काप्य<BR> is the name of a sage mentioned twice in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) iii. 3, 1; 7, 1. According to Weber, 2) Indische Studien, 1, 434, 435; Indian Literature, 126, 137, 223, 236, 237. his name is reminiscent of Kapila and Patañjali of the ŚāṅkhyaYoga system, but this suggestion may be regarded as quite improbable. 3) Cf. Garbe, Sāṅkhya Philosophie, 25, 26.

patatrin|पतत्रिन्
पतत्रिन्<BR> denotes a ‘flying creature’ generally in the Aitareya Upaniṣad, 1) iii. 3, 3. or more particularly a ‘bird’ in the Atharvaveda. 2) viii. 7, 24; x. 10, 14; xiv. 2, 44.

pataakaa|पताका
पताका,<BR> ‘banner,’ is not found until the Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 1, 39, 41 (here erroneously mentioned as patāka, masculine). Its Vedic equivalent is Dhvaja.

pati|पति
पति, पत्नी<BR> --Under these words denoting primarily, as the evidence collected in the St. Petersburg Dictionary shows, ‘lord’ and ‘lady,’ and so ‘husband’ and ‘wife,’ it is convenient to consider the marital relations of the Vedic community. Child Marriage.--Marriage in the early Vedic texts appears essentially as a union of two persons of full development. This is shown by the numerous references 1) Cf. Rv. i. 117, 7; ii. 17, 7; x. 39, 3; 40, 5. Ghoṣā is the chief example of this condition. The Atharvaveda (i. 14) also refers to such a case (see Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 253). The ornaments of maidens, especially at seasons of festival, are referred to in Rv. i. 123, 11; vii. 2, 5; Av. ii. 36, 1; xiv. 2, 59 et seq. to unmarried girls who grow old in the house of their fathers (amā-jur), and who adorn themselves in desire of marriage, as well as to the paraphernalia of spells and potions used in the Atharvavedic tradition 2) Cf. Av. iii. 18 (= Rv. x. 145); vi. 89; 102; 130; 131; vii. 36; 37; 38. Similarly there are many references to the love of the youth for the maiden, and his seeking her--e.g., Rv. i. 115, 2; Av. ii. 30; iii. 25; vi. 8; 9; 82; to their mutual affection--e.g., Rv. i. 167, 3; ix. 32, 5; 56, 3; x. 34, 5; and to jealousy and love philtres for the purpose of recalling wandering affections -e.g., Av. vi. 18; 42; 43; 94; 139; vii. 45. The gifts of the lover are referred to in Rv. i. 117, 18. Some of these passages may, of course, refer to Hetairai, but not all. to compel the love of man or woman respectively, while even the Rigveda 3) vii. 55, 5. 8. Cf. Rv. i. 134, 3; Aufrecht, Indische Studien, 4, 337 et seq. A different view of the passage is taken by Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 57 et seq. The Atharvaveda (iv. 5) shows that the view of Aufrecht was that early adopted in India. itself seems to present us with a spell by which a lover seeks to send all the household to sleep when he visits his beloved. Child wives first occur regularly in the Sūtra period, though it is still uncertain to what extent the rule of marriage before puberty there obtained. 4) Cf. Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 59; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 340 et seq.; 23, 356; Risley, People of India, 179 et seq. There is a possible reference to a child-wife in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 10, 1. For the Sūtra evidence, see Bhandarkar, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft, 47, 143-156; Jolly, ibid., 46, 413-426; 47, 610-615. The marriage ritual also quite clearly presumes that the marriage is a real and not a nominal one: an essential feature is the taking of the bride to her husband's home, and the ensuing cohabitation. 5) Rv. x. 85, especially verse 29 et seq. Limitations on Marriage.--It is difficult to say with certainty within what limits marriage was allowed. The dialogue of Yama and Yamī in the Rigveda 6) x. 10. seems clearly to point to a prohibition of the marriage of brother and sister. It can hardly be said, as Weber 7) Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1895, 822. Cf. also Indische Studien, 5, 427; 10, 76, n.; Pischel, Hermes, 18, 465-468; Max Müller, Science of Language, 2, 507; Herodotus, iii. 19. Crawley's Mystic Rose gives strong reasons against the early prevalence of such marriages. thinks, to point to a practice that was once in use and later became antiquated. In the Gobhila Gṛhya Sūtra 8) iii. 4, 5. and the Dharma Sūtras 9) Āpastamba Dharma Sūtra, ii. 5, 15, 16, etc. Cf. Mānava Dharma Śāstra, iii. 5; Yājñavalkya Dharma Śāstra, i. 52, 53. are found prohibitions against marriage in the Gotra (‘family’) or within six degrees on the mother's or father's side, but in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10) i. 8, 3, 6. marriage is allowed in the third or fourth generation, the former being allowed, according to Harisvamin, 11) On Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. by the Kāṇvas, and the second by the Saurāṣṭras, while the Dākṣiṇātyas allowed marriage with the daughter of the mother's brother or the son of the father's sister, but presumably not with the daughter of the mother's sister or the son of the father's brother. The prohibition of marriage within the Gotra cannot then have existed, 12) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 75, 76; Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 387; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 392; Geiger, Ostiranische Kultur, 246; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 43, 308-312; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 62, 63; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 345 et seq. though naturally marriages outside the Gotra were frequent. 13) Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 51, 279. Similarity of caste was also not an essential to marriage, as hypergamy was permitted even by the Dharma Sūtras, 14) Gautama Dharma Sūtra, iv. 16; Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra, i. 16, 2-5; Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, i. 24; 25; Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 4, etc.; Risley, People of India, 156 et seq. Cf. Varṇa. so that a Brāhmaṇa could marry wives of any lower caste, a Kṣatriya wives of the two lowest castes as well as of his own caste, a Vaiśya a Śūdrā as well as a Vaiśyā, although the Śūdrā marriages were later disapproved in toto. Instances of such intermarriage are common in the Epic, and are viewed as normal in the Bṛhaddevatā. 15) See Hopkins, cited in note 12; Bṛhaddevatā, v. 79; and Varṇa. It was considered proper that the younger brothers and sisters should not anticipate their elders by marrying before them. The later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas 16) See Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 578 et seq. present a series of names expressive of such anticipation, censuring as sinful those who bear them. These terms are the pari-vividāna, 17) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 9, and Kāṭhaka and Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitās, cited by Delbrück, 579, 580; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 9. In Āpastamba Dharma Sūtra, ii. 5, 12, 22, the expression is paryāhita. or perhaps agre-dadhus, 18) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 9, according to Delbrūck, 581. But, as pari-vividāna follows, it seems very doubtful; the reading is probably wrong, especially in view of the Kāṭhaka and Kapiṣṭhala parallels, which have agre-didhiṣau and agre-dadhiṣau. the man who, though a younger brother, marries before his elder brother, the latter being then called the parivitta; 19) See passages cited in note 17; also Av. vi. 112, 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 8, 11. Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, ix. 12, 11, and Dharma Sūtra, ii. 5, 12, 22, add parivinna to parivitta, but probably the two words should be identical in sense. the agre-didhiṣu, 20) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (see note 17) has agre-didhiṣu; Kapiṣṭhala, agre-dadhiṣu; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 8, 11, agra-didhiṣu. The Dharma Sūtras adopt agre-didhiṣu. the man who weds a younger daughter while her elder sister is still unmarried; and the Didhiṣū-pati, 21) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā has didhiṣū-pati; Kapiṣṭhala, dadhiṣū-pati; and so the Dharma Sūtras. Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 9, has the corrupt edidhiṣuḥ-pati. who is the husband of the latter. The passages do not explicitly say that the exact order of birth must always be followed, but the mention of the terms shows that the order was often broken. Widow Remarriage.--The remarriage of a widow was apparently permitted. This seems originally to have taken the form of the marriage of the widow to the brother or other nearest kinsman of the dead man in order to produce children. At any rate, the ceremony is apparently alluded to in a funeral hymn of the Rigveda; 22) x. 18, 8. for the alternative explanation, which sees in the verse a reference to the ritual of the Puruṣamendha (‘human sacrifice’), although accepted by Hillebrandt 23) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 40, 708. and Delbrück, 24) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 553. Cf. also Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 385; for the other view, see Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 848; Roth, Siebenzig Lieder, 151, n.; Zimmer. Altindisches Leben, 329. is not at all probable, while the ordinary view is supported by the Sūtra evidence. 25) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 2, 18. Cf. Lanman in Whitney, op. cit., 849. Moreover, another passage of the Rigveda 26) x. 40, 2. clearly refers to the marriage of the widow and the husband's brother (devṛ), which constitutes what the Indians later knew as Niyoga. 27) Cf. Yāska, Nirukta, iii. 15, with Roth's note; Geldner, Ṛgveda, Kommentar, 160; Weber, Indische Studien, v, 343, n.; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 355, n., 367; Jolly, Ṛecht und Sitte, 71; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 459; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 429. The custom died out in later times, is seems. This custom was probably not followed except in cases where no son was already born. This custom was hardly remarriage in the strict sense, since the brother might--so far as appears--be already married himself. In the Atharvaveda, 28) ix. 5, 27. 28. a verse refers to a charm which would secure the reunion, in the next world, of a wife and her second husband. Though, as Delbrück 29) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 553-555. Cf. Jolly, Rechtund Sitte, 59; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 371, n. thinks, this very possibly refers to a case in which the first husband was still alive, 30) This is certainly the case in Av. v. 17, 8, which, however, merely exalts the sanctity of the Brāhmaṇa, and does not necessarily imply remarriage at all. but was impotent or had lost caste (patita), 31) E.g., Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra, ii. 2, 3, 27. still it is certain that the later Dharma Sūtras 32) Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, xvii. 19. 20. 72-74; Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra, iv. 1, 16; Mānava Dharma Śāstra, ix. 175. Cf. also Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 281; 5, 306. began to recognize ordinary remarriage in case of the death of the first husband. Pischel 33) Vedische Studien, 1, 27. finds some evidence in the Rigveda 34) vi. 49, 8. Cf. Mahābhārata, iii. 70, 26. to the effect that a woman could remarry if her husband disappeared and could not be found or heard of. Polygamy.--A Vedic Indian could have more than one wife. This is proved clearly by many passages in the Rigveda; 35) Rv. i. 62, 11; 71, 1; 104, 3; 105, 8; 112, 19; 186, 7; vi. 53, 4; vii. 18, 2; 26, 3; x. 43, 1; 101, 11. Cf. Av. iii. 4; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 1, 4, etc. See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 455 et seq.; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 387; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 64; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 430, 431; Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 539, 540; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 353; Bloomfield, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 561. Manu, according to the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 36) i. 5, 8. had ten wives; and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 37) ix. 1, 4, 6. explains polygamy by a characteristic legend. Moreover, the king regularly has four wives attributed to him, the Mahiṣī, 38) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 9, 4, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 1, 4; vi. 5, 3, 1; vii. 5, 1, 1; xiii. 2, 6, 4; 4, 1, 8; 5, 2, 2. 5. 9; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xix. 1, 4. Cf. Rv. v. 2, 2; 37, 3; Av. ii. 36, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 9, 1; Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 220. the Parivṛktī, 39) Pari-vṛktā occurs in Rv. x. 102, 11; Av. vii. 113, 2; xx. 128, 10. 11; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2, 6, 6; 4, 1, 8; 5, 2, 7; parivṛktī in Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 9, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7. 3, 4; iii. 9, 4, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 10; xv. 4; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 1, 13. the Vāvātā, 40) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 22; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 3, 3; iii. 9, 4, 4; Av. xx. 128, 10. 11; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2, 6, 5; 4, 1, 8; 5, 2, 6. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 308, n.; Bloomfield, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 553, 554. and the Pālāgalī. 41) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 3, 3 et seq.; iii. 9, 4, 5; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 1, 8; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 4, 4. The Mahiṣī appears to be the chief wife, being the first one married according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 42) vi. 5, 3, 1. The Parivṛktī, ‘the neglected,’ is explained by Weber 43) Indische Studien, 10, 6. and Pischel 44) Vedische Studien, 2, 199. Cf. Geldner, ibid., 2, 38. as one that has had no son. The Vāvātā is ‘the favourite,’ while the Pālāgalī is, according to Weber, the daughter of the last of the court officials. The names are curious, and not very intelligible, but the evidence points to the wife first wedded alone being a wife in the fullest sense. This view is supported by the fact emphasized by Delbrück, 45) {|Indogermanische|} Verwandtschaftsnamen, 539. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 325. Yājñavalkya had, however, two apparently equal wives (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 1, and cf. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 10, 3). that in the sacrifice the Patnī is usually mentioned in the singular, apparent exceptions being due to some mythological reason. 46) E.g., Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 6, 4; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 3, 1. Zimmer 47) Altindisches Leben, 323. is of opinion that polygamy is dying out in the Rigvedic period, monogamy being developed from pologamy; Weber, 48) Indische Studien, 5, 222. Weber's theory that sapatna cannot be derived from sapatnī is, however, quite untenable. however, thinks that polygamy is secondary, a view that is supported by more recent anthropology. 49) See, e.g., Westermaarck, Origin and Development of Marriage; Crawley, Mystic Rose. Polyandry.--On the other hand, polyandry is not Vedic. 50) Mayr, Indisches Erbrecht, Wien, 1873, contends in favour of its existence. But see Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 191, 207; 10, 83, 84; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 48; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 354 et seq.; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 431, n. 2; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 44, 340342; Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 541-545. There is no passage containing any clear reference to such a custom. The most that can be said is that in the Rigveda 51) x. 85, 37. 38. and the Atharvaveda 52) Av. xiv. 1, 44. 52. 61; 2, 14. 27. verses are occasionally found in which husbands are mentioned in relation to a single wife. It is difficult to be certain of the correct explanation of each separate instance of this mode of expression; but even if Weber's 53) Indische Studien, 5, 191. So Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 326, who, however, suggests that the plural is generic. view, that the plural is here used majestatis causā, is not accepted, Delbrück's 54) Op. cit., 543. explanation by mythology is probably right. In other passages 55) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 2, 14. Cf. the plural śvaśurāḥ, ‘fathers-in-law,’ in Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 12. The Niyoga has, of course, nothing to do with polyandry. the plural is simply generic. Marital Relations.--Despite polygamy, however, there is ample evidence that the marriage tie was not, as Weber 56) Indische Studien, 10, 83. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 573, and cf. Dharma. has suggested, lightly regarded as far as the fidelity of the wife was concerned. There is, however, little trace of the husband's being expected to be faithful as a matter of morality. Several passages, 57) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 8, 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 7. indeed, forbid, with reference to ritual abstinence, intercourse with the strī of another. This may imply that adultery on the husband's part was otherwise regarded as venial. But as the word strī includes all the ‘womenfolk,’ daughters and slaves, as well as wife, the conclusion can hardly be drawn that intercourse with another man's ‘wife’ was normally regarded with indifference. 58) Cf. above, p. 396. The curious ritual of the Varuṇapraghāsās, 59) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 10, 11; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 2, 20; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 5, 2. in which the wife of the sacrificer is questioned as to her lovers, is shown by Delbrück 60) Op. cit., 550. to be a part of a rite meant to expiate unchastity on the part of a wife, not as a normal question for a sacrificer to put to his own wife. Again, Yājñavalkya's doctrine in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 61) i. 3, 1, 21. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 76, n. 2; Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. paraḥpuṃsā (cf. above, p. 397). Delbrück, op. cit., 551, shows also that neither the Dīkṣā (‘consecration’) nor the Pravara (‘invitation’ to Agni, as described by the names of the mythical ancestors of the invoker) gives any countenance to the theory of doubt as to the parentage of the Vedic Indians. which seems to assert that no one cares if a wife is unchaste (paraḥ-puṃsā) or not, really means that no one cares if the wife is away from the men who are sacrificing, as the wives of the gods are apart from them during the particular rite in question. Monogamy is also evidently approved, 62) Rv. i. 124, 7; iv. 3, 2; x. 71, 4, etc. so that some higher idea of morality was in course of formation. On the other hand, no Vedic text gives us the rule well known to other Indo-Germanic 63) Leist, Altarisches Jus Gentium, 276 et seq. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 388, 389; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 366, 367. peoples that the adulterer taken in the act can be killed with impunity, though the later legal literature has traces of this rule. 64) Cf. above, p. 396. There is also abundant evidence that the standard of ordinary sexual morality was not high. Hetairai.--In the Rigveda 65) Rv. i. 134, 3; iii. 53, 8; viii. 17, 7. Mahānagnī, Av. xiv. 1, 36; xx. 136, 5; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 27, denotes a courtesan. Cf. Av. v. 7, 8. So also puṃścalī, Av. xv. 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 22; puṃścalū, Taittirīyā Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 15, 1. there are many references to illegitimate love and to the abandonment of the offspring of such unions, 66) Rv. ii. 29, 1 (raha-sūḥ, ‘one who bears in secret.’ Cf. Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 26; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 333, 334). especially in the case of a protégé of Indra, often mentioned as the parāvṛkta or parāvṛj. 67) Rv. ii. 13, 12; 15, 7; iv. 19, 9; 30, 16; Zimmer, op. cit., 335. The child, when exposed, was in danger of being consumed by ants (vamrī). Cf. below, p. 493. The ‘son of a maiden’ (kumārī-putra) is already spoken of in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 68) xxx. 6. Such a person appears with a metronymic in the Upaniṣad period: 69) Cf. Jābāla Satyakāma. this custom may be the origin of metronymics such as those which make up a great part of the lists of teachers (Vaṃśas) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 70) Cf. Pāṇini, iv. 1, 116. But the custom may be due simply to polygamy (Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, p. 244, n. 2). The Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 71) xxiii. 30. 31: Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 19, 2. 3. refers to illicit unions of Śūdra and Ārya, both male and female, besides giving in its list of victims at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘human sacrifice,’ several whose designations apparently mean ‘courtesan’ (atītvarī) 72) xxx. 15. and ‘procuress of abortion’ (atiṣkadvarī), 73) xxx. 15; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 11, 1, has apaskadvarī. while the ‘dyeing woman’ (rajayitrī) is dedicated to sensuality. 74) xxx. 12; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 7, 1. Pischel and Geldner also see many references to Hetairai in other passages of the Rigveda, 75) Cf. Vedische Studien, 1, xxv, 196, 275, 299, 309; 2, 120, 154, 179, etc.; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 48. especially where mention is made of Uṣas, the goddess of Dawn, who in their view is the characteristic Hetaira. At any rate, there is little doubt that the ‘dancer’ (nṛtū) referred to in one passage of the Rigveda 76) i. 92, 4. was a Hetaira. When women are referred to as going to the Samana, or ‘place of meeting,’ Hetairai are probably also meant. 77) Rv. iv. 58, 8; vi. 75, 4; x. 168, 2. Perhaps also vrā in i. 124, 8; 126, 5. Grave cases of immorality are alluded to in the Rigveda. 78) x. 162, 5 (brother and sister: cf. above, p. 397). The love of father and daughter, as shown in the myth of Prajāpati, 79) Rv. x. 61, 5-7; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, viii. 2, 10; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 33; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 4, 1. is evidently censured, but the actual existence of this form of incest is recognized in the Atharvaveda. 80) viii. 6, 7. Girls who had lost their natural protectors--father or brother 81) Rv. i. 124, 7. Cf. Putrikā.<BR> --were apt to be reduced to live by immorality. Forms of Marriage.--The state of society revealed in the Vedic age seems to point to considerable freedom on the part of both man and woman in selecting a wife or a husband. At any rate, it is not clear that either the father or the mother controlled the marriage of son or daughter of mature age, 82) Cf. Delbrück, op. cit., 574. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 309, asserts that the consent of parent or brother was needed, but no clear evidence of this can be adduced. The later custom is not conclusive, since it is bound up with the usage of child marriage, which deprived both son and daughter of anyfree choice. Cf. ibid., 315; Kaegi, Der Rigveda, 15. though no doubt the parents or parent often arranged a suitable match. 83) This is so natural as not to need express evidence. Cf., e.g., the marriage proposals of Śyāvāśva Ātreya, as detailed in the Bṛhaddevatā, v. 49 et seq.; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 51 et seq. The marriage was frequently arranged through an intermediary, the ‘wooer’ (vara), 84) Rv. x. 78, 4; 85, 15. 23. Zimmer, op. cit., 310, exalts this into a universal practice, and compares the use of aryaman, ‘friend,’ as ‘bride-wooer.’ In Śyāvāśva's case, his father acted for him. presumably after those concerned had in effect come to an agreement. The sale of a daughter was not unknown, 85) Cf. Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 10, 11; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 4, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xx. vi. 5. See also Mānava Dharma Śāstra, iii. 53; viii. 204; ix. 98; Megasthenes in McCrindle's translation, p. 70; Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 407; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 345 et seq.; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 381; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 78 et seq.; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 86, n.; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 52. but a certain amount of discredit would seem to have attached to it, 86) Rv. i. 109, 2, refers to the gods Indra and Agni as more generous than a vijāmātṛ, ‘son-in-law,’ or a syāla, ‘brother-in-law.’ The force of vi in the former word must be unfavourable, and the sense, as indicated by Pischel, is no doubt, that a son-in-law who was not in other respects altogether suitable might have to buy his bride at a heavy cost. The vijāmātṛ is, in fact, the aśrīro jāmātā, the ‘ignoble son-in-law,’ of Rv. viii. 2, 20. Cf. Yāska, Nirukta, vi. 9; Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 255. and sons-in-law in such cases were sometimes stingy. On the other hand, dowries were not infrequently given, especially no doubt when damsels Suffered from bodily defects. 87) Cf. Rv. vi. 28, 5; x. 27, 12; Av. v. 17, 12. Possibly in Rv. i. 109, 2, there is a reference to a generous brother giving his sister a dowry in order to get her a husband. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 345; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 459; Kaegi, Der Rigveda, n. 352; Zimmer, op. cit., 310, n. It is doubtful whether anudeyī in Rv. x. 85, 6, means ‘dowry’ or not. See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 741. Occasionally marriages by capture may have taken place, but only as knightly feats, as when Vimada carried off Purumitra's daughter against her father's wish, but very possibly with her own consent. 88) Cf. Rv. i. 112, 19; 116, 1; 117, 20; x. 39, 7; 65, 12. Sāyaṇa's view that Kamadyū was daughter of Purumitra seems certain, though Zimmer, loc. cit., is doubtful. The later law-books and the Epic describe in much detail various forms of marriage, but they all seem reducible to three types: (a) that which is based on mutual consent, the prājāpatya (‘connected with Prajāpati’); (b) that in which a price is paid for the bride, the āsura (‘Asura-like’), ārṣa (‘connected with the Ṛṣis’), brāhma (‘relating to Brahman’), or daiva (‘divine’); (c) those which consist in stealing the bride, the kṣātra (‘warrior-like’) or the rākṣasa (‘demon-like’) mode, of all of which traces are found in Vedic literature. 89) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 361, 362; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 50 et seq.; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 29; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 383. For instance, the gift of a maiden for services rendered or other object is exemplified in the story of Cyavana in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, 90) iii. 122. and in that of Śyāvāśva in the Bṛhaddevatā. 91) v. 49 et seq. Wedding Ceremony.--In normal marriages the bridal was celebrated by an elaborate ceremony which bears in essentials and details the strongest resemblance to the form observed by other Indo-Germanic as well as non-Indo-Germanic peoples, 92) The older ritual is described with considerable detail in Rv. x. 85 and Av. xiv. 1 and 2. The later ritual, as elaborately traced in the Gṛhya Sūtras, is set out by Weber and Haas, Indische Studien, 5, 177-411. See also Leist, Altarisches Jus Gentium, 144 et seq.; von Schroeder, Die Hochzeitsgebräuche der Esten, Berlin, 1888; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 384 et seq.; Hopkins, op. cit., 13, 355 et seq.; Winternitz, Das altindische Hochzeitsrituell, 1892; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 739 et seq.; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 389 et seq. and which was destined to secure the stability and fruitfulness of the union. The ceremony commenced at the bride's house, 93) x. 17, 1. to which the bridegroom with his friends and relations repaired, and in which he met the friends and relations of the bride. 94) Rv. iv. 58, 9; Av. vi. 60; xiv. 2, 59. A cow or cows were slain for the entertainment of the guests. 95) Rv. x. 85, 13. The bridegroom having caused the bride to mount a stone, formally grasped her hand, and led her round the household fire. 96) Cf. Rv. x. 85, 36. 38; Av. xiv. 1, 47. 48. Before the bride mounted the stone, the groom repeated, according to the Gṛhya Sūtras (Āśvalāyana, i. 7. 3; Śāṅkhāyana, i. 13, 4; Pāraskara, i. 6, 3, etc.), the words, ‘I am he, thou art she; I the Sāman, thou the Ṛc; I the heaven, thou the earth; here will we unite ourselves and produce offspring,’ for which see Av. xiv. 2, 71; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxv. 18; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 27; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 19 (Mādhyaṃdina). This act constituted the marriage, the husband hence being called ‘he who takes by the hand’ (hasta-grābha). 97) x. 18, 8. Cf. Av. xiv. 1, 51. The festivities being over, 98) Av. xiv. 2, 59 et seq. the bridegroom took the bride to his home on a car in a marriage procession, 99) Rv. x. 85, 7. 8. 10. 24, 25. 26. 27. 42 et seq.; Av. xiv. 1, 60. all to the accompaniment of suitable stanzas. Then followed cohabitation. 100) See for the purification of the bride's garment, Rv. x. 85. 28-30. 35. Wife's Property and Status.--We have very little information as to the legal relations of wife and husband after marriage. It may be assumed that the husband appropriated the wife's dowry, if any, as well as her earnings, if any: even in the Epic 101) ‘They own neither themselves nor an inheritance’ (nātmanaś caneśate na dāyasyed), says the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 4, 2, 13. Cf. Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 6, 4; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 8, 2; Nirukta, iii. 4. Cf. for the Epic, Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 368. For compulsory obedience of the wife, cf. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 7. In the same Upanīṣad Yājñavalkya, on retiring from the ordinary life, divides his goods between his two wives. the rise of the recognition of women's property as their own (strī-dhana) is only slow. That the husband was absolute master of a wife as of a slave is not probable, though he doubtless exercised the same power of correction as was expressly allowed in the eighteenth century by English law. The poetical ideal 102) Rv. viii. 31, 5-9; x. 34, 11; 85, 18. 19. 42 et seq.; Av. iii. 30; xiv. 2, 32. of the family was decidedly high, and we have no reason to doubt that it was often actually fulfilled. Moreover, the wife on her marriage was at once given an honoured position in the house; she is emphatically mistress in her husband's home, exercising authority over her fatherin-law, her husband's brothers, and her unmarried sisters. 103) Rv. x. 85, 46. Cf. as regards the bridegroom's sisters, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 37. In Av. xiv. 2, 26, the daughter-in-law is to be ‘wealful’ (śambhūḥ) to her father-in-law, and ‘pleasant’ (syonā) to her mother-in-law, which is correct on either theory of her position as a daughter or a mistress. No doubt the case contemplated is one in which the eldest son of a family has become its head owing to the decrepitude 104) Cf. Rv. i. 70, 5, where an old fatḥer's goods are divided by his sons, and Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 327. Cf. also the possible case of a father who recovers after giving over all his goods to his son, Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv. 15. of the parents, his wife then taking the place of the mistress of the joint family while the brothers and sisters are still unmarried. It is not inconsistent with the great stress elsewhere 105) Av. viii. 6, 24; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 12 (Indische Studien, 5, 260); Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 6, 12; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 22; Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 514, 515. laid on the respect due to a father-in-law, who then is probably regarded as still in full possession of his faculties, and controls the house while his son continues to live with him. The respect would no doubt equally apply if the son had set up a separate family of his own. 106) No doubt it might also apply even if the father-in-law were decrepit; but it is hardly likely that, in these circumstances, the strong sense of respect evident in Av. viii. 6, 24, which implies fear, would have developed. Moreover, the wife was a regular participator in the offerings of the husband. In this connexion the term Patnī regularly applies to her in the Brāhmaṇas, 107) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 9, 2, 14; Pāṇini, iv. 1, 33; Delbrück, op. cit., 510, 512. where Jāyā designates her in her conjugal capacity, not in that of sharer in the sacrifice. In this respect her position gradually deteriorated: thus the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 108) i. 1, 4, 13. For the older practice, cf. Rv. i. 122, 2; iii. 53, 4-6; viii. 31, 5 et seq.; x. 86, 10, etc. describes a certain ceremony in which the wife (jāyā) alone offered the oblation in former times, while later a priest might do so instead. The same Brāhmaṇa shows other traces of a lowering in the position of women, probably due to the growing sense of the importance of ceremonial priority. 109) E.g., i. 3, 1, 9. 12. 13. Cf. Lévi, La doctrine du sacrifice, 157, 158. So in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 110) iii. 6, 3. women generally are classed with dice and drink as three chief evils, and woman is declared to be ‘untruth,’ 111) i. 10, 11. and connected with Nirṛti, ‘calamity.’ 112) Ibid. A woman too, according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 113) vi. 5, 8, 2. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 1, 9. is inferior even to a bad man, and a sarcastic reference is made in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 114) xxxi. 1. Cf. Aitareva Brāhmana, iii. 22. to her power of getting things from her husband by cajolery at night. On the other hand must be set the encomia on woman: a woman is half her husband, 115) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 1, 10. and completes him; 116) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 4, 17. and in the Rigveda 117) In viii. 33, 17, Indra is credited with a poor opinion of woman's intelligence, and Purūravas in x. 95, 15, frankly calls them hyenas. They are defended in v. 61, 6-8, but only against mean men (Paṇi). Cf. Kaegi, Der Rigveda, n. 351. attacks on women mingle with the general assumption of their good qualities. None the less, the Brāhmaṇas clearly indicate a gradual decline in their position, which is evident from the rule that requires the wife to eat after her husband. 118) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 9, 2, 12; x. 5, 2, 9. Cf. Vāsiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, xii. 13; Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra, i. 1, 2, 2; Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 330, n.; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 365, n. Scolds were also known: the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 119) iii. 24, 7. Cf. Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 22; Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 14, n. 2. praises the wife ‘who does not answer back’ (aprativādinī). Women bore no part in political life: men go to the assembly, not women, the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 120) iv. 7, 4. Cf. Av. vii. 38, 4. expressly says. On the other hand, with the advance of education, women shared in the intellectual interests of the day, as is exemplified by Yājñavalkya's 121) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 4, 1; iv. 5, 1. two wives, of whom one was interested in his philosophical discussions, the other not. Other women are also referred to in the Upaniṣads as teachers, but whether they were married is not certain. 122) Cf. the epithet gandharva-gṛhitā, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 29; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, ii. 9; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 3, 1; 7, 1; and see Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra. iii. 4, 4; Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 10. But the main object of a woman's marriage was the production of children, this being repeatedly asserted in the Rigveda and later. 123) Rv. i. 91, 20; 92, 13; iii. 1, 23; x. 85, 25. 41. 42. 45; Av. iii. 23, 2; v. 25, 11; vi. 11, 2, etc. The desire for offspring, as was natural in a society which mainly counted relationship through the father, took the form of a wish for a son to perform the necessary funeral rites for the father, and to continue his line. It was no doubt possible to adopt a son, but in the Rigveda 124) vii. 4, 7. 8. Cf. Nirukta, iii. 2. this custom is plainly viewed as unsatisfactory. The practice is recognized, 125) x. 18, 8; 40, 2. as we have seen above of Niyoga, in the appointment of a brother to beget children with the wife of a dead man, or perhaps of a man who is childless. ‘Sonlessness’ (avīratā) is placed on the same level as lack of property (amati), and Agni is besought to protect from it. 126) Rv. iii. 16, 5. The birth of a daughter was certainly not specially welcome: the Atharvaveda 127) vi. 11, 3. Cf. viii. 6, 25. in one hymn distinctly invokes the birth of a son, and deprecates that of a daughter, while the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 128) vii. 15. Cf. Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 409. contains an old verse which says that a daughter is a misery (kṛpaṇam), while a son is a light in the highest heaven (jyotir ha putraḥ parame vyoman). But there is no proof that the Vedic Indians practised the exposure of female children. This conclusion, deduced from certain passages in the later Saṃhitās 129) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 10, 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 6, 4; 7, 9; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvii. 9; Nirukta, iii. 4; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 17, 12. by Zimmer 130) Altindisches Leben, 319. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 314, n., who cites Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xi. 8, 8, as evidence of the exposure of two boys, but the sense is doubtful. and Delbrück, 131) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 575. See also Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 54, 210; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 6, 142; Kaegi, Der Rigveda, n. 49; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 389, 390. Böhtlingk's view is given in Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 44, 494-496, and cf. Pischel, Vedisehe Studien, 2, 48, who compares iv. 18, 5. has been disproved by Böhtlingk. Child Life.--No doubt the care of a child was left to the mother, but we learn little from the earlier literature 132) The later literature is full of details of the ceremonies before and after birth (see Delbrück, op. cit., 573 et seq.). Weber, Naxatra, 2, 314, n., gives the Vedic embryology; twins were disliked, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 9, etc. of the life of the young. The length of the period of pregnancy is frequently placed at ten (doubtless lunar) months. 133) Rv. v. 78, 9; x. 184, 3; Av. i. 11, 6; iii. 23, 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 13, 9; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5. 2, 4; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 9. 1; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 314, n. There are in the Av. many spells concerned with birth (i. 11, etc.), and miscarriages are mentioned (avatokā, avasū, Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 15; Av. viii. 6, 9, etc.). On birth the child was first fed with milk or ghee, and then given the breast. 134) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 3, 4 (Mādhyaṃdina = i. 5, 2 Kāṇva). Cf. also vi. 4, 24 et seq.; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 1, 6. After being weaned the child is ati-stana (Kauṣitaki Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2). On the eighth day after birth the infant was washed. 135) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 7, 2 (on Sāmaveda, ii. 525 = Rv. ix. 96, 17). The first ten days were the dangerous period (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 14; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxii. 14, 3). The cutting of the teeth was also a solemn occasion, 136) Av. vi. 140. and is the subject of a hymn in the Atharvaveda. Reference is also made to children's learning to speak, which the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 137) vi. 1, 6, 7. Cf. Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 4, 2, 38; xi. 1, 6, 3 5. ascribes to the end of the first year of life. The Aitareya Āraṇyaka 138) i. 3, 3. asserts that the words Tata and Tāta, onomatopoetic words like ‘dada,’ 139) Cf. Delbrück, op. cit., 449, 596. are the first words of a child's speech, giving therein perhaps an unfair prominence to the father. The Atharvaveda 140) vi. 68, Cf. ii. 13, according to Kauśika Sūtra, 53. 54, and cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 4, 1, 6. further contains at least one hymn for the ceremony of the first shaving of the young man's beard. The giving of a name was also an occasion of importance, a second one being often added. 141) Cf. Aitareya Āraṇyaka, i. 3, 3, with Keith's note; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1, 3, 9, and Nāman. Satī.--On the death of her husband, in some cases the widow burned herself or was burned by his relations. 142) Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 391; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 41; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 67-69; Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1896, 254 et seq.; Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 8, 468; Wilson, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 16, 202; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 329; Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 154. This is clearly implied in the reference to this ancient custom in the Atharvaveda. 143) Av. xviii. 3, 1. On the other hand, the Rigveda does not contemplate the custom anywhere, but on the contrary considers the widow as married apparently to the brother of the dead man. 144) x. 18, 7. 8. The custom of Suttee would therefore appear buring the Vedic age to have been in abeyance, at least as a general rule. At all times the practice seems to have been mainly usual among families of the warrior class, to judge from the other Indo-Germanic parallels. 145) Cf. Herodotos, v. 5 (of the Thracians); iv. 71 (of the Scythians); Procopius, De Bello Gothico, ii. 14 (of the Heruli). So in Germany Brynhild and Nanna are instances (cf. Weinhold, Altnordisches Leben, 476 et seq.). The universality of the custom must not be exaggerated, as Zimmer, 331, is inclined to do. To burn all the wives of a king would, in primitive ages, have been a wasteful action; even the chief wife would often have had to be spared on one ground or another. The Rigveda already reveals a state of society in which the actual burning of the wife was avoided by a semblance of it in the funeral ritual of (cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 126). The reward of a good wife was to go to the world of her husband (pati-loka) after death (cf. Av. xiv. 1, 64; xviii. 3, 1; Rv. x. 85, 43). A Vedic citation in the scholiast on Pāṇini, iii. 2, 8, Vārttika, 2, says that a Brahmin woman who drinks Surā, an intoxicating liquor, does not go to the world of her husband after death. In other classes the survival of wives was more necessary, and the remarriage of widows, whether prohibited or allowed in the texts, is proof that there were widows who could be remarried. 146) Cf. perhaps the gartāruh of Rv. i. 124, 7, as explained by Yāska, Nirukta, iii. 5; Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 22.

patti|पत्ति
पत्ति<BR> is used in the Atharvaveda (vii. 62, 1) to designate the ‘foot soldier’ in war as opposed to the Rathin, ‘charioteer,’ the latter defeating (ji) the former. One of the epithets of Rudra in the Śatarudriya liturgy of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (xvi. 19) is ‘lord of footmen’ (pattīnāṃ pati).

patnii|पत्नी
पत्नी<BR> See Pati. A part of the house is the Patnīnāṃ Sadana, mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 1) ix. 3, 7. presumably the women's quarters. The phrase is borrowed from the Patnīśāla, ‘hut for the wife,’ of the Brāhmaṇa 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 18; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 6, 9, 8; x. 2, 3, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 22 (-śālā); Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xix. 6, etc. ritual.

pathinsaubhara|पथिन्सौभर
पथिन् सौभर<BR> (‘descendant of Sobhari’) is mentioned in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1) ii. 5, 22 (Mādhyaṃdina = ii. 6, 3 Kāṇva); iv. 5, 28 (Mādhyaṃdina = iv. 6, 3 Kāṇva). as the pupil of Ayāsya Āṅgirasa.

pathikRt|पथिकृत्
पथि-कृत्,<BR> ‘path-maker,’ is not a rare epithet in the Rigveda 1) ii. 23, 6; vi. 21, 12; ix. 106, 5; x. 14, 15; 111, 3, etc. and later, 2) Av. xviii. 2, 53; 3, 25, etc. showing clearly the importance naturally attached in primitive times to the finding of roads. The frequency with which the epithet is applied to Agni 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 1, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 1, 5, 5; xii. 4, 4, 1; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, iv. 3, etc. suggests that there is here an allusion to fire burning the primæval forest and rendering advance possible. The god Pūṣan is pathi-kṛt, as guarding the flocks. 4) Sāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, iii. 4, 9; xvi. 1, 17. The Sūtra, xvi. 1, 18, explains pathi-kṛt merely as adhipati, ‘lord’; but the sense must be more pregnant than that. The Ṛṣis, 5) Rv. x. 14, 15, where the expression refers to their finding the way to the heavenly world; but it is probably a transfer of an epithet of terrestrial application. or seers, as ‘path-makers,’ may be compared with the Roman Pontifices.

pad|पद्
पद्<BR> in the Atharvaveda (xix. 6, 2) and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xi. 3, 2, 3) denotes a ‘quarter.’ This sense is derived from the primary meaning of ‘foot,’ which as applied to quadrupeds would represent ‘one-fourth.’ Cf. Pāda.

pada|पद
पद<BR> in the sense of ‘quarter of a stanza’ is found as early as the Rigveda 1) i. 164, 24. 45. and often later. 2) Av. ix. 10, 19; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 25; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6. 10. 17, etc.; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxii. 1. 5. In the Brāhmaṇas it also denotes a ‘word’ as opposed to a ‘letter’ (Varṇa). 3) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxvi. 5, where the sequence is half-stanza (ardharca), quarter-stanza (pāda), word (pada), and letter (varṇa). Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 2, 6, 13; xi. 5, 6, 9, etc.

padi|पदि
पदि<BR> is found once in the Rigveda, 1) i. 125, 2. where, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, the word probably designates some kind of animal. Yāska 2) Nirukta, v. 18. explains it as equivalent to gantu, ‘a moving creature,’ but Durga 3) In his commentary on Nirukta, loc. cit. as meaning ‘bird.’ The passage may refer to catching the Padi in a net (? mukṣījā). 4) Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 129; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 244.

payas|पयस्
पयस्<BR> denotes the ‘milk’ of the cow in the Rigveda 1) i. 164, 28; ii. 14, 10; iv. 3, 9; v. 85, 2; x. 30, 13; 63, 3, etc. and later. 2) Av. iv. 11, 4; xii. 1, 10; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iv. 3. Cf. Go and Kṣīra. More generally it has also the sense of ‘sap’ or ‘fluid’ found in plants, 3) Av. iii. 5, 1; x. 1, 12; xiii. 1, 9; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvii. 1; xviii. 36, etc. So of Soma, Rv. ix. 97, 14. and giving them life and strength. In other passages it denotes the ‘water’ of heaven. 4) Rv. i. 64, 5; 166, 3; iii. 33, 1. 4; iv. 57, 8, etc. A vow to live for a time on milk alone occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 5) Payo-vrata, ‘one who undergoes a vow (to subsist) on (nothing but) milk,’ ix. 5, 1, 1 et seq.; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, viii. 9. The Dīkṣita subsists on it alone.

payasyaa|पयस्या
पयस्या<BR> in the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 13, 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 11, 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 22. 24; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 4, 10. 21; 5, 1, 12; 2, 9, etc. denotes curds, said to consist of a mixture of sour milk and hot or cold fresh milk. 2) See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 381, n. 2.

पर आट्णार<BR> (‘descendant of Aṭṇāra’) appears in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittīrīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 5, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxii. 3 (Indische Studien, 3, 473). and the Brāhmaṇas 2) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 16, 3; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 11. as one of the ancient great kings who won sons by performing a particular sacrifice. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3) xiii. 5, 4, 4. he is styled Hairaṇyanābha, ‘descendant of Hiraṇyanābha,’ and in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 4) xvi. 9, 11. he is called Para Āhlāra Vaideha, a fact testifying to the close connexion of Kosala and Videha. A Yajña-gāthā, or ‘sacrificial verse,’ there 5) Ibid., 13. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 7; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 7; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 165, n. 4. cited mentions Hiraṇyanābha Kausalya in connexion with Para.

paramajyaa|परमज्या
परम-ज्या,<BR> ‘of supreme power,’ is understood by Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159. in one passage of the Rigveda 2) viii. 1, 30. as the proper name of a great man among the Yadus. But it is doubtful whether the word is more than an epithet. 3) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 39. 

parashu|परशु
परशु<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 127, 3; vii. 104, 21; x. 28, 8; 53, 9, etc. and later 2) Av. iii. 19, 4; vii. 28, 1; xi. 9, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 10; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 6, 4, 10; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 35; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, x. 1; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, ii. 11, etc. denotes the axe of the woodcutter. Of its form we know nothing. A red-hot axe was used in a form of ordeal (Divya) applied in accusations of theft. 3) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 16, 1. See also Parśu.

parashvan|परश्वन्
परश्वन्<BR> See Parasvant.

parasvant|parasvat|परस्वत्|परस्वन्त्
परस्वन्त्<BR> denotes a large wild animal which Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. conjectures to be the wild ass. It is mentioned in the Vṛṣākapi hymn 2) x. 86, 18. of the Rigveda, twice in the Atharvaveda, 3) vi. 72, 2; xx. 131, 22. and in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 4) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 10; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 8; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 21, 1, where the commentator takes it to be the wild buffalo. in all of which passages the sense of ‘wild ass’ is satisfactory. More doubtful is the meaning of the word paraśvā(n) in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, 5) i. 2. where the commentary explains it as ‘serpent.’ It is, of course, quite possible that the word has nothing to do with parasvant. Bühler 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 63; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 17, n. 1; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 377, n. 1. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 633; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 86, 87; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 335; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 105. suggests connexion with the Pāli palāsāda, ‘rhinoceros.’

paraavRj|परावृज्
परा-वृज्<BR> is a term found in four passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 112, 8; ii. 13, 12; 15, 7; x. 61, 8. in all of which it refers to a person in a forlorn condition, while one 2) x. 61, 8. of them also speaks of him as going south. Sāyaṇa's 3) On i. 112, 8, etc., of. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 152. view that the word is a proper name is most unlikely, while Grassmann's 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 1, 23, and cf. Wörterbuch, s.v. explanation of it as ‘cripple’ is still less probable. Roth's 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. interpretation of it as ‘exile’ seems clearly right in the passage which refers to the Parāvṛj as going south. Zimmer 6) Altindisches Leben, 185, 334, 335. accepts Roth's view for this passage, but in the others sees a reference to the child of a maiden exposed by her and in danger of being eaten by insects (vamrī). This view is supported by the fact that parāvṛkta seems to have the same sense, 7) Rv. iv. 30, 19. Cf. iv. 30, 16; 19, 9. and is accepted by Oldenberg. 8) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 200. Cf. above, p. 481, n. 67. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 248; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 402.

paraashara|पराशर
पराशर<BR> is mentioned with Śatayātu and Vasiṣṭha in the Rigvedic hymn celebrating Sudās' 1) vii. 18, 21. victory over the ten kings. According to the Nirukta 2) vi. 30. he was a son of Vasiṣṭha, but the Epic version makes him a son of Śakti and grandson of Vasiṣṭha. Geldner 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 132. thinks that he is mentioned in the Rigveda along with Śatayātu, perhaps his uncle, and his grandfather Vasiṣṭha, as the three sages who approached Indra and won his favour for Sudās. He is erroneously credited with the authorship of certain hymns of the Rigveda 4) i. 65-73. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 110, 111; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 324. The Parāśaras as a school appear in the Kāṭhaka Anukramaṇī (Indische Studien, 3, 460). by the Anukramaṇī (Index).

parixit|परिक्षित्
परि-क्षित्<BR> appears in the Atharvaveda 1) xx. 127, 7-10. See also Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des Veda, 156, 157, and the verses in the Vaitāna Sūtra, xxxiv. 9. The Vedic spelling is Parikṣit, not Parīkṣit. as a king in whose realm, that of the Kurus, prosperity and peace abound. The verses in which he is celebrated are later 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 32, 10; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxx. 5; Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 12; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 17. called Pārikṣityaḥ, and the Brāhmaṇas explain that Agni is pari-kṣit because he dwells among men. Hence Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Bloomfield 4) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 690, 691. but see Atharvaveda, 101, n. 9. regard Parikṣit in the Atharvaveda not as a human king at all. This may be correct, but it is not certain. Both Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 131. and Oldenberg 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 237; Buddha, 396. recognize Parikṣit as a real king, a view supported by the fact that in the later Vedic literature King Janamejaya bears the patronymic Pārikṣita. If this be so, Parikṣit belonged to the later period, since the Atharvan passage in which his name occurs is certainly late, and none of the other Saṃhitās know Parikṣit at all. The Epic 7) See Zimmer, loc. cit. makes him grandfather of Pratiśravas and great-grandfather of Pratīpa, and Zimmer, 5) Altindisches Leben, 131. probably with justice, compares the Prātisutvana and Pratīpa found in another late Atharvan passage. 8) xx. 129. But Devāpi and Śantanu cannot be brought into connexion with Pratīpa. 9) Devāpi is really a Brahmin, son of Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa, and not connected directly with Śantanu. Yāska, Nirukta, ii. 10, identifies them as brothers and Kurus; but the former part of the identification is, no doubt, wrong.

parigha|परिघ
परि-घ<BR> denotes an iron bolt or bar in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (ii. 24, 6. 10. 15) as often later.

parichakraa|परिचक्रा
परि-चक्रा<BR> is according to one reading the name of a Pañcāla town mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 5, 4, 7. and identified by Weber 2) Indische Studien, 1, 192. with the later Ekacakrā, which was near Kāmpīla. 3) Mahābhārata, i. 6094. There is a various reading Parivakrā. 4) Accepted by the scholiast and Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 397.

parichara|परिचर
परि-चर<BR> is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) iv. 3, 5, 9. Cf. pari-caritṛ, Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vii. 8, 1. in the sense of ‘attendant.’ In the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 2) vi. 11; Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 457. pari-caraṇa has the same sense metaphorically, the other two Vedas (Sāma and Yajur) being said to be subsidiary to the Rigveda.

paricharmaNya|परिचर्मण्य
परि-चर्मण्य<BR> denotes a thong of leather in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (vi. 12) and the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka (ii. 1).

paritakmyaa|परितक्म्या
परि-तक्म्या<BR> in a number of passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 116, 15; iv. 41, 6; 43, 3; v. 30, 13; 31, 11; vi. 24, 9; vii. 69, 4. denotes ‘night’ according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary. Sieg 2) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 128. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 36; Rigveda, Glossar, 106. thinks that in one place 3) i. 116, 15. at least the word signifies the decisive point of the race, something like the sense of Prapitva. But this is very doubtful.

paridaa|परिदा
परि-दा<BR> in a few passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) ii. 4, 1, 11; ix. 2, 1, 17; 4, 2, 17; 4, 5; 5, 1, 53. has the sense of ‘giving oneself up to the mercy or protection of another.’

paridhaana|परिधान
परि-धान<BR> denotes ‘garment,’ probably ‘under garment,’ in the Atharvaveda (viii. 2, 16) and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 1, 10). A garment of saffron is mentioned in the Śānkhāyana Āraṇyaka (xi. 4).

paripad|परिपद्
परि-पद्<BR> seems in the Rigveda 1) x. 28, 10; metaphorically, viii. 24, 24. to denote a pitfall used to capture lions.

paripanthin|परिपन्थिन्
परि-पन्थिन्,<BR> ‘besetting the path,’ denotes ‘robber’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 42, 3; 103, 6; x. 85, 32. and later. 2) Av. i. 27, 1; iii. 15, 1; xii. 1, 32; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iv. 34, etc. Cf. Taskara, Tāyu, Stena.

paripavana|परिपवन
परि-पवन<BR> signifies in the Nirukta (iv. 9. 10) an instrument for winnowing grain.

parimit|परिमित्
परि-मित्<BR> occurs once in the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 3, 1. in the description of a house, meaning perhaps the ‘crossbeams’ connecting the vertical posts. 2) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 596; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 158; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 525. Cf. Gṛha.

parimoSha|परिमोष
परि-मोष<BR> in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) ii. 5, 5, 1; vi. 1, 11, 5. signifies ‘theft,’ and parimoṣin in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) xi. 6, 3, 11; xiii. 2, 4, 2, etc. ‘thief.’ 

parirathya|परिरथ्य
परि-रथ्य<BR> occurs once in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 8, 22. meaning either ‘road’ 2) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 587, following Nīlakaṇṭha's explanation of parirathya, Mahābhārata, viii. 1487. or a part of the chariot, perhaps as Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 528. and Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 506. render it, the ‘rim.’

parivakraa|परिवक्रा
परि-वक्रा<BR> is the reading accepted in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 5, 4, 7) by the scholiast instead of the variant Paricakrā, which is supported by the Epic Ekacakrā.

parivatsara|परिवत्सर
परि-वत्सर<BR> denotes in the Rigveda 1) x. 62, 2. and later 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa i. 5, 5, 6; Mahābhārata, i. 3202, etc. So parivatsarīṇa, as an adjective, ‘relating to a full year,’ Rv. vii. 103, 8; Av. iii. 10, 3. a ‘full year.’ It is often mentioned with other names of year (see Saṃvatsara), and in the later five year cycle counts as the second year.

parivaapa|परिवाप
परि-वाप<BR> in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 10, 1; vi. 5, 11, 4; vii. 2, 10, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 11; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 21. 22. and Brāhmaṇas 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 24; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 11, 2, etc. denotes ‘fried grains of rice.’

parivitta|परिवित्त
परि-वित्त<BR> denotes an ‘elder brother who is not married when his younger brother is.’ The term occurs in the list of sinful persons in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxi. 7; Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā, xlvii. 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 9; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 8, 11; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 9. as well as in the Atharvaveda, 2) vi. 112, 3. where Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 470. needlessly proposes to read parivettā, the ‘younger brother who marries before his eldest brother.’ The name for the younger brother in the older texts is Parivividāna. 4) So in the Kāṭhaka, Kapiṣṭhala, Maitrāyaṇī, and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitās, loc. cit. Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 580 et seq.; Bloomfield, American Journal of Phīlology, 17, 430 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 522 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 315; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 362.

pariveShTR|परिवेष्टृ
परि-वेष्टृ<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 6, 51. and later 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 3, 1, 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 2, 16; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vi. 13; xxx. 12. 13; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 8, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 21; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 6; iii. 8, 2, 3; vi. 2, 13, 3, etc. denotes an ‘attendant,’ more especially one who serves up food, a ‘waiter.’ The feminine form Pariveṣṭrī signifies a ‘female attendant’ or ‘handmaid.’ 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 2, 7, 4; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, ii. 1; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 21, n. 2.

parivraajaka|परिव्राजक

परि-षद्<BR> (lit., ‘sitting around’) denotes in the Upaniṣads 1) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 1 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 2, 1 Kāṇva); daivī pariṣad, Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, ii. 11, 13. 14. an ‘assemblage’ of advisers in questions of philosophy, and the Gobhila Gṛhya Sūtra 2) iii. 2, 40. refers to a teacher with his Pariṣad or ‘council.’ In the later literature the word denotes a body of advisers on religious topics, but also the assessors of a judge, or the council of ministers of a prince. 3) Cf. Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 136, 137; Foy, Die kōnigliche Gewalt, 16-19; 3337; 66; Bühler, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 55, 56; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 124. But in none of these senses is the word found in the early literature, though the institutions indicated by it must have existed at least in embryo.

pariShkanda|परिष्कन्द
परि-ष्कन्द<BR> (lit., ‘leaping around’) occurs in the Vrātya hymn of the Atharvaveda (xv. 2, 1 et seq.) denoting, in the dual, the two footmen running beside a chariot.

pariShyanda|परिष्यन्द
परि-ष्यन्द<BR> (with water ‘flowing around’) in two passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ix. 1, 19; xiv. 3, 1, 14) denotes a sandbank or island in a river. 

parisaaraka|परिसारक
परि-सारक<BR> is the name of a place, an island formed by the Sarasvatī ‘flowing around’ it, according to a story in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (ii. 19).

parisrut|परिस्रुत्
परि-स्रुत्<BR> is the name of a drink which is mentioned first in the Atharvaveda, 1) iii. 12, 7; xx. 127, 9. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 68. and which was distinct from both Surā and Soma, 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 2, 14. Cf. v. 5, 4, 10; xi. 5, 5, 13; xii. 7, 1, 7; 8, 2, 15; 9, 1, 1. but was intoxicating. According to Mahīdhara, 3) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ii. 34. the liquor was made from flowers (Puṣpa). Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 281, 282. thinks that it was the family drink, and this is supported by the fact that in the Atharvaveda it twice occurs as a household beverage. 5) See also Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 15; xx. 59; xxi. 29; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 2. Its nature is more elaborately explained in the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiv. 1, 14; xv. 10, 11; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 349, 350. Hillebrandt 6) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 24, 8. is of opinion that it was very much the same as Surā.

pariiNah|परीणह्
1. Parī-ṇah appears to denote a ‘box’ or something similar in the Atharvaveda (xix. 48, 1).

pariiNah|परीणह्
2. Parī-ṇah is the name of a place in Kurukṣetra mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 1) xxv. 13, 1. the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, 2) v. 1, 1. and the Sūtras. 3) Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 19, 1; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxiv. 6, 34; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 29, 32.

परी-शास<BR> is the name of an instrument of the nature of tongs, used to lift the sacrificial kettle off the fire. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1, 3, 1; 2, 1, 16; 2, 54; 3, 1, 20, etc.

paruchChepa|परुच्छेप
परुच्-छेप<BR> is the name of a Ṛṣi to whom the Anukramaṇī (Index) attributes a series of hymns 1) Rv. i. 127-139. in the Rigveda, and whose authorship is asserted in the Aitareya 2) v. 12. 13 (where hymns Rv. i. 128, 129, 130, 133, 135, 137, 139, are attributed to him). and the Kauṣītaki 3) xxiii. 4. 5. Brāhmaṇas, as well as in the Nirukta. 4) x. 42. In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 5) ii. 5, 8, 3. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 116. Parucchepa's claim to authorship is very doubtful. he appears as a rival of Nṛmedhas.

paruSha|परुष
परुष<BR> seems to mean ‘reed’ in the Atharvaveda (viii. 8, 4) and ‘arrow’ in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xiv. 22, 20).

paruShNii|परुष्णी
परुष्णी<BR> is the name of a river which is mentioned in the Nadī-stuti (‘Praise of Rivers’), 1) x. 75, 5. and in the song of Sudās’ victory over the ten kings, 2) vii. 18, 8. 9. which seems to have been made decisive by the rise of the river drowning the fugitives. 3) It is impossible to decide precisely what part the river played in the battle. It is usually held that the enemies of Sudās tried to divert the stream, but failed, and were drowned in its current. So Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 11; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 154; Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 103, holds that Sudās was caught between two opposing armies, and had to escape over the Paruṣṇī, that his enemies tried to divert it to render him more accessible to their attack, but failed, and were overwhelmed in the river. Hopkins, India, Old and New, 52 et seq., may be right in rejecting in toto the theory of the attempted diversion of the waters, though in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 261 et seq., he accepted the traditional view. In these passages and one of the eighth book of the Rigveda, 4) viii. 74, 15. where it is called a ‘great stream’ (mahenadi), the name is certainly that of the river later called Ravi (Irāvatī), as recognized by Yāska. 5) Nirukta, ix. 26. Pischel 6) Vedische Studien, 2, 208-210. sees a reference to it in two other passages of the Rigveda, 7) iv. 22, 2; v. 52, 9. where ‘wool’ (ūṛṇā) is connected with the word paruṣṇī, and the allusion to the river is accepted by Max Müller 8) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 315, 323. and Oldenberg, 9) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 348. though they are not fully agreed as to the exact sense of the passages in question. Pischel suggests that the name is derived from the ‘flocks’ (parus) of wool, not from the bends of the river, as understood by the Nirukta, 5) Nirukta, ix. 26. or from its reeds, as Roth 10) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 4a. suggests. The mention of the Paruṣṇī and the Yamunā in the hymn celebrating the victory of Sudās has given rise to the conjectures of Hopkins, 11) Op. cit., 52. that the Yamunā in that hymn is merely another name for the Paruṣṇī, and of Geldner, 12) Ṛgveda, Glossar, 106. that the Paruṣṇī there is merely a tributary of the Yamunā (Jumna). But neither interpretation is either essential or even probable. The hymn is a condensed one, and may well be taken as celebrating two great victories of Sudās. There is a doubtful reference to the Paruṣṇī in the Atharvaveda. 13) vi. 12, 3. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 462; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 289.

parus|परुस्
परुस्<BR> means first a ‘limb’ or ‘member’ of the body, 1) Rv. i. 162, 18; x. 97, 12; 100, 5; Av. i. 12, 3; iv. 12, 2. 3, etc. and is then applied metaphorically to the divisions of the sacrifice 2) Rv. x. 53, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 9, 1. or of the year 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 6, 1. (cf. Parvan).

1. Parṇa denotes the ‘wing’ of a bird in the Rigveda 1) i. 116, 15; 182, 7; 183, 1; iv. 27, 4, etc. and later. 2) Av. x. 1, 29; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 5, etc. It also means the ‘feather’ of an arrow in a late passage of the Rigveda, 3) x. 18, 14. Cf. Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 386. and more often later; 4) Av. v. 25, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxv. 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 25; iii. 26, etc. and the ‘leaf’ of a tree from the Rigveda onwards. 5) Rv. x. 68, 10; Av. viii. 7, 12; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 1, 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 46, etc.

parNa|पर्ण
2. Parṇa denotes the tree Butea frondosa, later usually called Palāśa. It occurs in the Rigveda 1) x. 97, 5. in connexion with the Aśvattha, and with that tree as well as the Nyagrodha in the Atharvaveda, 2) v. 5, 5. which mentions both amulets 3) iii. 5, 4. 8. and the cover of sacrificial dishes 4) xviii. 4, 53. as made from its wood. Its use for the making of sacrificial implements like the ladle (juhū), 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 59, 7, 2. Cf. Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 1. or sacrificial posts, 6) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxi. 4, 13. or the small ladle called sruva, 7) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 2. Cf. viii. 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 3, 11; 7, 1, 9; 8, 7. is mentioned. The Taittirīya Saṃhitā 8) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, loc. cit., and cf. Kuhn, Die Herabkunft des Feuers und des Göttertranks, 148, 192; Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 20, 24; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 331, 332; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 91. ascribes its origin to the loss of a feather by the Gāyatrī when winning the Soma. The tree is also often mentioned elsewhere. 9) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 4, 10; vi. 5, 1, 1; xi. 1, 4, 2; 7, 28; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ix. 5, 4. Reference too is sometimes made to its bark (parṇa-valka). 10) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 3, 5; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, 4, 2, 18, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altinadisches Leben, 59; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 194, 195.

parNaka|पर्णक
पर्णक<BR> is the name of a man included in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 1) xxx. 16. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 2) iii. 4, 12, 1. According to Mahīdhara, 3) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit. a Bhilla is meant--i.e., presumably a wild hillman, for he glosses Niṣāda in the same way. 4) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 27. Sāyaṇa 5) On Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. explains the word as meaning ‘one who catches fish by putting over the water a parṇa with poison,’ but this is apparently a mere etymological guess. Weber's 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländiscnen Gesellschaft, 18, 281. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 119. rendering of the term as referring to a savage ‘wearing feathers’ is ingenious, but uncertain.

parNadhi|पर्णधि
पर्ण-धि<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 6, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 300; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 375; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 154. denotes the part of the shaft in which the feather of the arrow is fastened.

parNaya|पर्णय
पर्णय<BR> is the name in two passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 53, 8; x. 48, 2. either of a hero, as Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 149. thinks, or of a demon 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. overcome by Indra. 

paryanka|पर्यङ्क
पर्य्-अङ्क<BR> is the name of the seat of the Brahman in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad. 1) i. 5. It seems to correspond to what is elsewhere called Āsandi; 2) Av. xv. 3, 3. Cf. xiv. 2, 65; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5, 6, 12. as used in the Upaniṣad, it can, however, hardly mean a long seat for reclining on, but rather a throne. 3) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 397, 401; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 155; Lanmar in Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 765, 776.

paryaasa|पर्यास
पर्य्-आस<BR> is used in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (iii. 1, 2, 18) to denote the woof of cloth, the warp being called anuchāda.

parvata|पर्वत
1. Parvata in the Rigveda 1) i. 37, 7; v. 56, 4. and the Atharvaveda 2) Av. iv. 6, 8; vi. 12, 3; 17, 3; ix. 1, 18; xii. 1, 11. is conjoined with giri in the sense of ‘hill’ or ‘mountain.’ From the Rigveda 3) i. 39, 5; 52, 2; 155; 1; 191, 9; ii. 12, 2, 3; 17, 5, etc. onwards 4) Av. i. 14, 1; iii. 21, 10; iv. 9, 8; viii. 7, 17; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 5, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvii. 1; xviii. 13, etc. it is common in this sense as connected with the waters of rivers which flow in the hills. 5) Rv. vii. 34, 23; 35, 8; viii. 18, 16; 31, 10; x. 35, 2; 36, 1, etc.; Pischel, Vedische Studien, i. 80; 2, 66. The legend of the mountains having wings is already found in the Saṃhitās. 6) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvi. 9; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 10, 13; and Rv. iv. 54, 5, as explained by Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 174. In the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 7) ii. 13; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 407; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 28, n. 1. are mentioned the southern (dakṣiṇa) and the northern (uttara) mountains, evidently in allusion to the Himālaya and the Vindhya ranges. The plants (oṣadhi) and aromatic products (añjana) of the mountains are referred to in the Atharvaveda, 8) xix. 44, 6; 45. 7. and their mineral treasures in the Rigveda. 9) x. 69, 6.

parvata|पर्वत
2. Parvata in one passage of the Rigveda 1) vii. 87, 8 denotes, according to Ludwing, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159. a sacrificer whose generosity is praised. But it is probable that the god Parvata, the spirit of the mountain, is meant. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 

parvata|पर्वत
3. Parvata is mentioned several times in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) vii. 13, 34; viii. 21; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 17. 4. along with Nārada. The Anukramaṇī (Index) attributes to him the authorship of several hymns of the Rigveda. 2) viii. 12, ix, 104; 105.

parvan|पर्वन्
पर्वन्<BR> denotes the knots of the reed or the joints of a plant, 1) Av. xii. 3, 31; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i, 1, 2, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 3, 1, 31, and cf. Rv. x. 68, 9. and more generally a part or limb of the body. 2) Rv. i. 61, 12; iv. 19, 9; viii. 48, 5; x. 89, 8; Av. i. 11, 1; 12, 2; ii. 9, 1; vi. 14, 1; xi. 8, 12; xii. 5, 71; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 31; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 35 et seq.; iii. 4, 4, 2; vi. 1, 2, 31; x. 4, 5, 2, etc. It also designates a period of time, probably with reference to the breaks in the month at new and full moon. 3) Rv. i. 94, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 43; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 35; vi. 2, 2, 34, etc. Cf. Māsa. In the Sūtras the days of the four-monthly festivals (cāturmāsaya) are so called: Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, v. 2, 13; xxii. 7, 1. 16. 17; xxiv. 4, 30; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiv. 5, 6; 10, 4. 18; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ix. 2, 3; and more often the periods of the change of moon: Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra. xxiv. 6, 4. 25. 30; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iii. 2, 1; 3, 1; Lāṭyāyana Srauta Sūtra, viii. 8, 46, etc. In one passage 4) vii. 103, 5. Geldner 5) Ṛgveda, Glossar, 107. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 364, who quotes Tacitus, Germania, 11. thinks the word indicates a song section of the Sāmaveda.

parshaana|पर्शान
पर्शान,<BR> ‘hollow,’ is mentioned several times in the Rigveda (vii. 104, 5; viii. 7, 34; 45, 41).

parshu|पर्शु
1. Parśu denotes ‘rib’ in the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 7, 6; x. 9, 20; xi. 3, 12. and later. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 25, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxi. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, viii. 6, 2, 10; x. 6, 4, 1; xii. 3, 1, 6; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, etc. Cf. Śarīra.

parshu|पर्शु
2. Parśu seems in some passages 1) Av. xii. 3, 31 (Kauśika Sūtra, i. 24. 25; viii. 11; lxi. 38. 39); perhaps vii. 28, 1 = Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 4, 1. See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 407, 408; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 26 (where parśu is metrically needed), etc. Cf. Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. to denote a ‘sickle,’ being apparently a variant of Paraśu. 

parshu|पर्शु
3. Parśu in the Nirukta 1) iv. 6. is explained in one passage of the Rigveda 2) i. 105, 8; x. 33, 2. as meaning the sides of a cistern (kūpa). 3) Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 100; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 107. But the sense of ‘ribs’ is quite adequate there.

parshu|पर्शु
4. Parśu occurs in one passage in a Dānastuti (‘praise of gifts’) in the Rigveda 1) viii. 6, 46. as the name of a man. It is not certain that he is identical with Tirindira, but the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 2) xvi. 11, 20. mentions Tirindira Pāraśavya as the patron of Vatsa Kāṇva. In another passage occurring in the Vṛṣākapi hymn, 3) x. 86, 23. Apparently Vārttika 2, on Pāṇini, iv. 1, 177, where Parśu is explained as a feminine, Princess of the Parśus, refers to this passage. On the sense, cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 42; Rigveda, Glossar, 107; and Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 2, 2, where the expression occurs, but where the sense is very dubious. Parśu Mānavī occurs, apparently as a woman, daughter of Manu, but who is meant it is quite impossible to say. Excepting these two, there are no other occurrences in which the word has with any probability the value of a proper name in the Rigveda. Ludwig, 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 196 et seq. however, sees in several other places an allusion to the Parśus. Thus in one passage of the Rigveda 5) x. 33, 2. The sense here is, no doubt, ‘ribs.’ See Geldner, op. cit., 2, 184, n. 3; Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 2, 362, n. he finds a reference to the defeat of Kuruśravaṇa by the Parśus; in another 6) vii. 83, 1, pṛthu-parśavaḥ, which really means either ‘with large ribs’-i.e., ‘strong,’ as Roth, with Sāyaṇa, inclines to take it--or ‘with broad axes,’ according to Zimmer. he finds a reference to the Pṛthus and Parśus--i.e., the Parthians and the Persians. He also sees the Parthians in Pārthava, a name found in one hymn. 7) vi. 27, 8. The same view is taken by Weber, 8) Indische Studien, 4, 379; Indian Literature, 4; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 36 et seq. He confines his view to the equation of Parśu in Rigveda, viii. 6, 46, and the Persians. Hillebrandt, who is inclined to see relations with Iran in early times (see Paṇi, Pārāvata, Sṛñjaya), does not in this connexion quote Parśu at all, and, though he mentions Pārthava, does not regard it as probably referring to a Parthian (Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105). Brunnhofer, in his various works (Iran und Turan, 1889; vom Pontus bis zum Indus, 1890, etc.), finds constant references in the Veda to events in Iran, but his theories must be regarded as definitely unscientific. See also Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 264, n. who holds that historical connexions with the Persians are referred to. But Zimmer 9) Altindisches Leben, 134 et seq.; 433. Ibid., 434, 435, he refutes conclusively Ludwig's extraordinary view that Pṛthu and Parśu are dialectical forms of the same word. points out that this conclusion is not justified; the Parśus were known to Pāṇini 10) v. 3, 117. as a warrior tribe; the Pāraśavas were a tribe in south-west Madhyadeśa; and the Periplus 11) c. 38. knows a tribe of Parthoi in north India. At most the only conclusion to be drawn is that the Indians and Iranians were early connected, as was of course the case. Actual historical contact cannot be asserted with any degree of probability.

parSha|पर्ष
पर्ष<BR> occurs in the Rigveda, 1) x. 48, 7; Nirukta, iii. 10. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238. Perhaps parṣin, in the compound iṣu-parṣin in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 2, 5, means ‘having a bundle (of arrows).’ denoting in the plural ‘sheaves’ strewn over the threshing floor. Cf. Khala.

palada|पलद
पलद<BR> occurs twice in one hymn of the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 3, 5, 17. Cf. Zimmer. Altindisches Leben, 153; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 194, 195. in the description of a house. It seems to mean bundles of straw or reeds used to thatch the house and render the sides wind and weather proof.

palasti|पलस्ति
पलस्ति<BR> See Palita.

palaala|पलाल
पलाल<BR> is found with Anu-palāla in the Atharvaveda (viii. 6, 2) as the name of a demon. The meaning of the word is ‘straw,’ in which sense it occurs in the Kauśika Sūtra (lxxx. 27), while the feminine form, Palālī, is found in the Atharvaveda itself (ii. 8, 3) as the straw of barley (Yava).

palaava|पलाव
पलाव<BR> is found in the Atharvaveda 1) xii. 3, 19, where some manuscripts read palāvā. and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 2) i. 54, 1 in the sense of ‘chaff.’ 

palaasha|पलाश
पलाश,<BR> like Parṇa, denotes ‘leaf’ in the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, x. 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 4, 5; v. 2, 1, 17 etc.; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 14, 3. It also 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 3, 19; ii. 6, 2, 8, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 59. designates the tree Butea frondosa, of which Parṇa is the early name.

palita|पलित
पलित,<BR> ‘grey-haired,’ occurs frequently from the Rigveda 1) i. 144, 4; 164, 1; iii. 55, 9; x. 4, 5, etc. onwards. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 15, etc. It is the distinctive sign of old age. Those who, like certain descendants of Jamadagni, do not grow old, 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 9, 1; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxi. 10, 6. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 54, and Rv. iii. 53, 16, where palasti seems to mean palita. are said not to become grey-haired, while Bharadvāja is described as having in his old age become thin and grey-haired. 4) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 49. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5) xi. 4, 1, 6. 14. in one passage observes that grey hairs appear first on the head, and elsewhere 6) iii. 8, 2, 25. alludes to the hair on the arms having become grey.

palpuulana|पल्पूलन
पल्पूलन<BR> is found in the Atharvaveda 1) xii. 4, 9. Cf. Kauśika Sūtra, xi. 16. and the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 2) ii. 5, 5, 6. apparently meaning, properly, ‘lye,’ or water impregnated with some biting substance for washing clothes. In the Atharvan passage urine seems to be meant. 3) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 695. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 74, 175. The verb palpūlaya, ‘to wash with alkaline water,’ occurs in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 2) ii. 5, 5, 6. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa; 4) i. 3, 5, 2. 3. and the Sūtras refer to hides (carman) 5) Kauśika Sūtra, 67. and garments 6) Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iii. 8, 12. Cf. Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra. i. 6, 13, 15; Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. so washed. Cf. also Vāsaḥpalpūlī.

palliguptalauhitya|पल्लिगुप्तलौहित्य
पल्लि-गुप्त लौहित्य<BR> (‘descendant of Lohita’) is mentioned in a Vaṃśa (‘list of teachers’) in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 42, 1) as a pupil of Śyāmajayanta Lauhitya. The name is obviously a late one, for Palli is not found in the early literature, and the name of the Lauhitya family is otherwise known in post-Vedic works only.

pavana|पवन
पवन<BR> (‘purifier’) in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 34, 2; xviii. 3, 11. Cf. Nirukta, vi. 9. denotes an instrument for purifying grain from husks, etc.; either a ‘sieve’ or a ‘winnowing basket’ may be meant. In the Sūtras 2) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 5, 7. it is mentioned as used for cleaning the bones of the dead after cremation.

pavamaana|पवमान
पवमान<BR> is a term very frequently applied in the Rigveda to the Soma ‘purifying itself’ by running through the sieve. Later it appears in a few passages 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 20, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vi. 17; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7. in the sense of ‘wind’ (as a purifier).

pavasta|पवस्त
पवस्त<BR> in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 5, 6. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda. 156. apparently denotes ‘covers.’

pavi|पवि
पवि<BR> denotes the ‘tire’ of the wheel of a chariot in the Rigveda 1) i. 34, 2; 88, 2; 139, 3; 166, 10, etc.; Nirukta, v. 5. and later. 2) Sāmaveda, ii. 7, 1, 15, 3, etc. Reference is made 3) Rv. vi. 54, 3. to the necessity for fastening it on firmly, and the epithet su-pavi, ‘having a good tire,’ is found in the Atharvaveda 4) Av. iv. 12, 6. with su-nābhi, ‘having a good nave,’ and su-cakra, ‘having a good wheel.’ The tires were, of course, of metal, 5) Of gold in the case of the Aśvins and the Maruts, Rv. i. 64, 11; 180, 1. and being sharp, 6) Rv. i. 166, 10. could serve on occasion as weapons. 7) Rv. v. 52, 9. Cf. vi. 8, 5, and x 180, 2. The St. Petersburg Dictionary in one passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 8) vi. 30. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 9, 4, 5. Mahīdhara, on the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, takes pavinā as vajrasadṛśena, ‘like a thunderbolt,’ and Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 239, 240, renders pavi by ‘bolt.’ takes Pavi to mean a metal rim on the stone for pounding Soma, but this seems improbable, because no such metal attachment is elsewhere alluded to. Hillebrandt 9) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 44. seems clearly right in accepting the sense of ‘sharp edge’ in this passage, especially as the stones in the Rigveda 10) v. 31. 5. are, in allusion to their rolling action, styled ‘rims without horses and without chariots’ (anaśvāsaḥ pavayo 'rathāḥ). The Nirukta 11) xii. 30. ascribes to Pavi the sense of arrow (śalya), but this is very uncertain. The St. Petersburg Dictionary cites for this use two passages of the Rigveda, 12) ix. 50, 1; x. 180, 2. but in one the secondary sense of sharp-edged weapon with reference to the bolt of Indra is quite likely, and in the other, where the expression vāṇasya pavi occurs, the sharp-edged pounding-stone of the ‘reed,’ 13) Cf. Rv. iv. 24, 9, where the expression vāṇaṃ duhanti, ‘they milk out the reed,’ occurs. meaning the stalk of the Soma plant, may be meant. Hillebrandt 14) Op. cit., 1, 43, 44. thinks a reference to the shape of the Soma plant is intended. Pavī-nasa, the name of a demon mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 15) viii. 6, 21. seems to throw no light on this point, for while the St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it to mean ‘whose nose is like a spearhead,’ it is translated as ‘rim-nosed’ (presumably in allusion to the curved shape of the nose) by Whitney. 16) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 497. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 248; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 12, n. 1.

pavitra|पवित्र
पवित्र<BR> denotes in the Rigveda, 1) i. 28, 9; iii. 36, 7; viii. 33, 1; 101, 9, etc. and later, 2) Av. vi. 124, 3; ix. 6, 16; xii. 1, 30; 3, 3. 14. 25, etc. the sieve used for purifying the Soma, the only mode of purifying it certainly 3) Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 239, 240. known to the Rigveda. It seems clearly 4) Cf. the names of it: aṇva, Rv. ix. 16, 2; aṇvāni meṣyaḥ, 86, 47; 107, 11; avayaḥ, ii. 36, 1; ix. 86, 11; 91, 2; tvac with avya or avyaya, ix. 69, 3; 70, 7; meṣyaḥ, ix. 8, 5; rūpa avyaya, ix. 16, 6; roman, alone or with avyaya; vāra, alone or with avyaya, etc. to have been made of sheep's wool, whether woven or plaited is not certain, for the expressions used are too vague to be decisive, though Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 278, n. thinks hvarāṃsi 6) ix. 3, 2; 63, 4. points to plaiting.

paviira|पवीर
पवीर,<BR> according to the Nirukta, 1) xii. 30, In Rv. i. 174, 4, pavīrava seems to mean ‘thunderbolt.’ denotes a ‘lance.’ The epithet derived from this word, pavīravant or pavīrava, which is found in the Atharvaveda 2) iii. 17, 3. and the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 3) Pavīravant, Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xii. 71; pavīrava, Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 10, 2, 5, 6; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 7, 12; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvi. 11. is used of the plough, apparently in the sense of ‘having a metal share.’ The same epithet occurs in the Rigveda 4) x. 60, 3. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 116. applied to a man, in the sense of ‘having a goad’ or ‘having a spear.’

paviiru|पवीरु
पवीरु<BR> appears in a hymn of the Rigveda 1) viii. 51, 9 = Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxiii. 82. as a Ruśama, being a prince or at least a wealthy noble.

pashu|पशु
पशु<BR> means ‘animal’ generally, including man. There is frequent mention 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 10, 1-4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvi. 17; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 7, 17; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 47-51, Cf. Av. xi. 2, 9; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 10, 1-3; v. 5, 1, 1. 2; vi. 5, 10, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 28-31, etc. of the five sacrificial animals--the horse, the cow, the sheep, the goat, and man. Seven such domestic animals are spoken of in the Atharvaveda 2) Av. iii. 10, 6. and later; 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 8, 4, 16; ix. 3, 1, 20; xii. 8, 3, 13 (where they are called jāgatāḥ, perhaps as numbering 12); Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, x. 2, 7. probably, as Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 103. observes, merely as a sacred mystic number, not, as the commentator 5) On Av. iii. 10, 6. The St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests ‘mule’ and ‘ass’ as the two making up seven (cf. Mahābhārata, vi. 165 et seq.). Zimmer's view (Altindisches Leben, 76) is that ‘goat,’ ‘sheep,’ ‘ox,’ ‘horse,’ ‘dog,’ ‘ass,’ and ‘camel’ or ‘mule,’ are meant. explains, the usual five with the ass and the camel added. Animals are also referred to as ubhayadant and anyatodant. They are further 6) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 4, 5, 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 7 (where puruṣa must be read for paruṣa). classified as those which take hold with the hand (hastādānāḥ), man (puruṣa), elephant (hastin), and ape (markaṭa), and those which grasp by the mouth (mukhādānāḥ). Another division is that of biped (dvipād) and quadruped (catuṣpād). 7) Rv. iii. 62, 14; Av. iii. 34, 1, etc. Zimmer, 73, n., suggests that the division is Indo-European, as the Inguvenic tables make a distinction between dupursus and peturpursus. Man is a biped; 8) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 10, 1, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvii. 47, 48. he is the first (prathama) of the beasts; 9) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 2, 1, 18; vii. 5, 2, 6. he alone of animals lives a hundred years (śatāyus), 10) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 6, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 2, 5, 17. and he is king of the animals. 11) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xx. 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5, 5, 7. Cf. Weber, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 18, 274. He possesses speech (vāc) in conjunction with the other animals. 12) Rv. viii. 100, 11. In the Aitareya Āraṇyaka 13) ii. 3, 2, with Keith's note. an elaborate distinction is drawn between vegetables, animals, and man in point of intellect. Of animals apart from man a threefold division is offered in the Rigveda 14) x. 90, 8.<BR> --into those of the air (vāyavya), those of the jungle (āraṇya), and those of the village (grāmya), or tame animals. The division into āraṇya and grāmya animals is quite common. 15) Av. iii. 31, 3. Cf. ii. 34, 1, with Whitney's note, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 78; xi. 2, 24; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 3; 9, 7; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiii. 12; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iii. 2, 29. 32; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 1, 8; 2, 8. Cf. xi. 8, 3, 2, where there is reference to animals being tied up at night in their stalls. In the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 16) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv, 3, 10, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 30. is found a division into eka-śapha, ‘whole-hoofed’; kṣudra, ‘small’; and āraṇya, ‘wild,’ the two former classes denoting the tame animals. 16) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 10, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 30. The horse and the ass are eka-śapha; 17) Zimmer, 74. the kṣudra are the sheep, the goat, and the ox: this distinction being parallel to that of ubhayadant and anyatodant. 18) Cf. Av. v. 31, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 6, 3, with Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 1, 5: v. 1, 1, 3; 2, 6. Zimmer 19) Op. cit., 77, 78. sees in a passage of the Atharvaveda 20) xi, 2, 24. 25, compared with xii. 1, 40, 51. a division of wild animals (āraṇya) into five classes: (1) those of the jungle described as the ‘dread beasts which are in the wood’ (mṛgā bhīmā vane hitāḥ); (2) winged creatures, represented by the Haṃsa, ‘gander,’ Suparṇa, ‘eagle,’ Śakuna, ‘bird’; (3) amphibia--Śiṃśumāra, ‘alligator,’ and Ajagara, ‘crocodile’ (?); (4) ‘fish,’ Purīkaya, Jaṣa, and Matsya; (5) insects and worms (described as rajasāḥ). But this division is more ingenious than probable, and it is ignored by both Bloomfield 21) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 631. and Whitney. 22) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 633, 634. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72. 77.

pashupa|पशुप
पशु-प<BR> denotes ‘herdsman’ in the Rigveda. 1) i. 114, 9; 144, 6; iv. 6, 4; x. 142, 2. Metaphorically the term is applied to Pūṣan. 2) vi. 58, 2. Cf. of Pūṣan and Revatī, Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 2, 12.

paShThavaah|पष्ठवाह्
1. Paṣṭha-vāh occurs in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 5, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 9; xviii. 27; xxi. 17; xxiv. 13. 28. 29. etc. meaning an ox, four years old, according to the commentators. This qualification is, however, very doubtful, for Paṣṭhauhī, ‘cow,’ a word occurring quite frequently, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā vii. 1, 6, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 2; xii. 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 27; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 3, 3; 8. 3, 2; ii. 7, 2, 2, etc. is in one passage 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 6, 1, 11. accompanied by the adjective prathama-garbhāḥ, ‘having a first calf,’ which disproves the theory of the age adopted by the commentators.

paShThavaah|पष्ठवाह्
2. Paṣṭha-vāh is mentioned as a seer of Sāmans in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xii. 5, 11. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160.

pastyasad|पस्त्यसद्
पस्त्य-सद्<BR> (‘sitting in the house’) occurs in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) vi. 51, 9. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 211. where the sense seems to be ‘inmate,’ ‘companion.’ 

pastyaa|पस्त्या
पस्त्या<BR> (fem. pl.) is a word occurring in several passages of the Rigveda. 1) Rv. i. 25, 10; 40, 7; 164, 30; iv, 1, 11; vi, 49, 9; vii. 97, 5; ix, 65, 23; x. 46, 6. See also iv. 55, 3; viii. 27, 5, where Pastyā appears as a goddess. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. ascribes to it the meaning of ‘house’ or ‘dwelling,’ in the wide sense of the term, as well as that of the ‘family’ living in the house; and this view is accepted by Zimmer. 3) Altindisches Leben, 149. Cf. Weber, U7ber den Rājasūya, 43, n. 4; 63. On the other hand, Pischel 4) Vedische Studien, 2, 211-22. So Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 107. finds in two of the passages 5) vi. 49. 9; vii. 97, 5, where the sense is ‘householder’ (gṛha-stha or gṛhin, as Sāyaṇa renders it). usually referred to Pastyā the neuter Pastya, which appears in Pastya-sad and in Pastyā-vant (where the length of the second syllable is not primitive¤), and which is certainly found in the Rigveda 6) x. 96, 10. 11. In x. 96, 10, Roth takes pastyoḥ to denote the two parts of the Soma press, but Pischel, 2, 211, accepts Sāyaṇa's rendering ‘heaven and earth.’ In the compounds tripastya of Agni, Rv. viii. 39, 8; vājapastya of Pūṣan, vi. 58, 2, of Soma, ix. 98, 12; and vīra-pastya, v. 50, 4, the primitive word may very well be pastya, not pastyā. in the metaphorical sense of ‘dwelling,’ ascribed to it in the Naighaṇṭuka. 7) iii. 4, misquoted by Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 151, 2, as applying to pastyā, whereas it really refers to pastya. In the other passages 8) Rv. i. 25, 10 = Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 16, 1 = Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 6, 2; ii. 6, 12; 7, 16; iv. 4, 6 = Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 27; Rv. i. 40, 7; 164, 30 (used of Agni's home); iv. 1, 11; ix. 65, 23; x. 46, 6; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 12, 1 = Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 8 = Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 7. he thinks the word means ‘rivers’ or ‘waters’; in particular, where Soma in the middle of the Pastyās 9) Rv. ix. 65, 23. is spoken of, the sees a reference to Kurukṣetra, with its several rivers, 10) Rv. iii. 23, 4. Āpayā, Dṛṣadvatī, and Sarasvatī (cf. 2. Pastyāvant). In some passages 11) Rv. iv. 55, 3; viii. 27, 5; and in pastyāvant in ix. 97, 18. he sees in Pastyā the proper name of a stream, just as Sindhu primarily means ‘river,’ then the ‘Indus.’

pastyaavant|pastyaavat|पस्त्यावत्|पस्त्यावन्त्
1. Pastyā-vant, explained in the Pada text as Pastya-vant, occurs in several passages of the Rigveda. In two of them 1) i. 151, 2; ix. 97, 18; but the latter passage is explained by Pischel as referring to Pastyā, the river, and by Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v., as ‘kept in the stall.’ a rich householder seems meant, and in the two others reference to a ‘house’ is clear. 2) Barhis, Rv. ii. 11, 16, ‘of the house’; kṣayān pastyāvataḥ, iv. 54, 5, ‘abodes having (fixed) habitations.’ Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 212.

pastyaavant|pastyaavat|पस्त्यावत्|पस्त्यावन्त्
2. Pastyā-vant occurs in one passage of the Rigveda 1) viii. 7, 29. in the locative parallel with Suṣoma, Śaryaṇāvant, and Ārjīka. It must apparently denote a place, as Pischel 2) Vedische Studien, 2, 209. argues, probably corresponding to the locality ‘in the middle of the streams’ (madhye pastyānām), elsewhere 3) Rv. ix. 65, 23. referred to as the home of Soma. Pischel 4) Op. cit., 2, 219. suggests that Patiāla is meant, though he does not lay any stress on the similarity of name. In the north of Patiāla there are hills where the Soma might have grown. Roth 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 260, 398, 399, takes Pastyāvant as a place-name, but thinks that pastyā denotes ‘hamlet,’ or, as an epithet of Aditi, refers to her as a ‘housewife’ (Rv. iv. 55, 3; viii. 27, 5). thought that something connected with the Soma press was meant.

paaMsu|पांसु
पांसु<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) vii. 109, 2; xii. 1, 26. and later 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 10, 2; Nirukta, xii. 19, etc. denotes ‘dust’ or ‘sand,’ usually in the plural. Among the portents enumerated in the Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa 3) vi. 8 (Indische Studien, 1, 40). Cf. Varāhamihira, Bṛhatsaṃhitā, xxii. 6. is a rain of dust or sand (pāṃsuvarṣa), a phenomenon not rare in India. 4) The adjective pāṃsura is found in Rv. i. 22, 17, with a variant, pāṃsula, Sāmaveda, i. 3, 1, 3, 9. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5, 1, 9.

paakaduurvaa|पाकदूर्वा
पाक-दूर्वा<BR> is, in a verse of the Rigveda, 1) x. 16, 13. included with Kiyāmbu and Vyalkaśā among the plants used for growing on the spot where the corpse of the dead man has been consumed with fire. 2) See Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 11, 342-350; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, xxxix. The verse is repeated in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 3) vi. 4, 1, 2. with the variant Kyāmbu. In the Atharvaveda 4) xviii. 3, 6. the word is read Śāṇḍadūrvā. Pākadūrvā is probably, as Sāyaṇa-understands it, paripakva-dūrvā, ‘ripe or edible millet.’ Śāṇḍadūrvā is explained by the commentator 5) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 850. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70. in various ways, as millet ‘having egg-shaped roots’ (i.e., sāṇḍa, not śāṇḍa), or as ‘having long joints,’ with the additional remark that it was called bṛhaddūrvā, ‘large millet.’ In the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, on the other hand, the commentary explains Pākadūrvā as small millet.

paakasthaamankaurayaaNa|पाकस्थामन्कौरयाण
पाक-स्थामन् कौरयाण<BR> is celebrated as a generous donor  in a hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 3, 21. 24. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160. suggests, without much reason, that he may have been a king of the Anus.

paakaru|पाकरु
पाकरु<BR> is mentioned as a disease, together with Viṣūcikā and Arśas, ‘hæmorrhoids,’ in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 1) xii. 97 Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 393. Its nature is unknown; the etymology 2) From pāka, ‘maturity,’ and aru = arus, ‘sore.’ points to the sense of ‘developed sores,’ ‘ulcers.’

paanktra|पाङ्क्त्र
पाङ्क्त्र<BR> is the name of an animal mentioned in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha, or ‘horse-sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 26. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 85. The ‘field-rat’ seems to be meant.

paancajanya|पाञ्चजन्य
पाञ्च-जन्य,<BR> ‘relating to the five peoples.’ See Pañcajanāḥ.

paancaala|पाञ्चाल
पाञ्चाल<BR> means a ‘king of the Pañcāla people,’ and is applied to Durmukha in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) viii. 23. and to Śoṇa in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 2) xiii. 5, 4, 7. The term is also found in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 3) iii. 29, 1. Cf. Kāṭhaka Anukramaṇī in Indische Studien, 3 460. See also Pañcāla. 

paanci|पाञ्चि
पाञ्चि,<BR> ‘descendant of Pañcan,’ is the name of a teacher mentioned with disapproval in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) i. 2, 5, 9; ii. 1, 4, 27. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 434.

paaTava|पाटव
पाटव,<BR> ‘descendant of Paṭu,’ is a patronymic of Cākra in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xii. 8, 1, 17; 9, 3, 1).

paaTaa|पाटा
पाटा<BR> is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 27, 4. and in the Kauśika Sūtra. 2) xxxvii. 1; xxxviii. 18. Cf. Ṛgvidhāna, iv. 12, 1. It is assumed by the commentator to be identical with the later Pāṭhā, the plant Clypea hernandifolia, which was much used medicinally, and is still so used at the present day according to Roth. 3) Quoted in Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 68. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 190; 17, 266; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 305, n. 1; Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, May, 1885, xlii-xliv. Very possibly the word should be read as Pāṭhā.

paaNighna|पाणिघ्न
पाणि-घ्न,<BR> ‘hand-clapper,’ is enumerated among the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 20; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 15, 1. Presumably a man who drives away birds from the fields by making a noise is intended.

paaNDva|पाण्ड्व
पाण्ड्व<BR> in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (v. 3, 5, 21) denotes an uncoloured woollen garment.

paatalya|पातल्य
पातल्य<BR> is found in one passage of the Rigveda 1) iii. 53, 17. meaning some part of the chariot. What it was is quite uncertain. Hopkins 2) Journal of the American Oriental Socicty, 13, 242, 243; 20, 224. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 251; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 108. suggests that, as in the Epic, it was possibly a piece of wood on the axle to hold the pole of the car. 

paatra|पात्र
पात्र,<BR> primarily a ‘drinking vessel’ (from pā, ‘to drink’) denotes a vessel generally both in the Rigveda 1) i. 82, 4; 110, 5; 162, 13 (to hold the broth from the flesh of the horse); 175, 1; ii. 37, 4; vi. 27, 6, etc. and later. 2) Av. iv. 17, 4; vi. 142, 1; ix. 6, 17; xii. 3, 25. 36; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 6, 2; vi. 3, 4, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 62; xix. 86. etc. It was made either of wood 3) Rv. i. 175, 3. or clay. 4) Av. iv. 17, 4. In some passages 5) Av. x. 10, 9; xii. 3, 30; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 1, 5; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Śūtra, xvi. 1, 7, etc. the word is, according to Roth, used to indicate a measure. The feminine Pātrī occasionally occurs 6) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 17; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 8; ii. 5, 3, 6; 6, 2, 7; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, v. 8, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 271. in the sense of ‘vessel.’

paathya|पाथ्य
पाथ्य,<BR> a word occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) vi. 16, 15. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 4, 2, 4; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 153. is either an epithet meaning ‘being in heaven’ (pāthas), or a patronymic, as Sāyaṇa interprets it, of Vṛṣan.

paada|पाद
1. Pāda in the Atharvaveda 1) xiv. 1, 60. and later 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5. 12; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 8, 3, 6, etc.; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, i. 5. denotes the ‘foot’ of an animal, a bird, and other creatures.

paada|पाद
2. Pāda, as a measure of length, denotes ‘foot’ in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) vi. 5, 3, 2; vii. 2, 1, 7; viii. 7, 2, 17; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, vi. 10, etc. The term is occasionally 2) Nirukta, ii. 7; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 1, 2. used to express a measure of weight. As a fraction it means a ‘quarter,’ a sense derived from that of ‘foot’ of a quadruped (just as śapha, the divided hoof, comes to mean an ‘eighth’). ^3) Rv. x. 90, 3. 4.

paada|पाद
3. Pāda is the regular expression for a ‘quarter verse’ in the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 4; Kauṣīaki Brāhmaṇa, xxvi. 5; Nirukta, vii. 9; xi. 6; Lāṭyāyana Srauta Sūtra, i. 2, 1; x. 6, 9, etc. This sense is merely a limitation of ‘quarter’ = the ‘foot’ of a quadruped 

paana|पान
पान,<BR> ‘drink,’ occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 4, 2, 17. and the Upaniṣads. 2) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 1, 43; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 2, 7, etc.

paanta|पान्त
पान्त<BR> occurs several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 122, 1; 155, 1; viii. 92, 1; ix. 65, 28 (a very doubtful passage); x. 88, 1. apparently 2) So Nirukta, vii. 25; Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 122, 123. meaning ‘drink,’ ‘beverage’ (cf. Pāna). Geldner, 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 139; Rigveda, Glossar, 108. however, thinks that in one passage^4 Pānta is the name of a prince.

paannejana|पान्नेजन
पान्-नेजन<BR> in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) iii. 8, 2, 1; 9, 3, 27; xiii. 5, 2, 1. denotes a ‘vessel for washing the feet.’

paapayaxma|पापयक्ष्म
पाप-यक्ष्म<BR> See Yakṣma.

paapasama|पापसम
पाप-सम,<BR> a ‘bad season,’ is in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) iii. 3, 8, 4. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 342. opposed to Puṇya-sama, a ‘good season.’

paaman|पामन्
पामन्<BR> occurs in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 22, 12. Cf. for the reading, Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 261. See also Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 1, 8. as the name of a skin disease. The derivative adjective, Pāmana, ‘suffering from skin disease,’ is found in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 3, 8; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiii. 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 1, 31. Cf. Grohmann, Indische Studien, 9, 401 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 388; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 421, n.; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 450, 451; Atharvaveda, 63. Since it is mentioned as an accompaniment of fever, probably a cutaneous eruption or scab consequent on fever is meant.

paayu|पायु
1. Pāyu, meaning ‘guard,’ ‘protector,’ occurs several times in the Rigveda. 1) i. 147, 3; ii. 1, 7; iv. 2, 6; 4, 3. 12; vi. 15, 8; viii. 18, 2; 60, 19; x, 100, 9. 

paayu|पायु
2. Pāyu is found in the Rigveda 1) vi. 47, 24. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 128. as the name of a poet, a Bhāradvāja. In the Bṛhaddevatā 2) v. 124 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. he is credited with assisting Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna and Prastoka Sārṅjaya by consecrating their weapons with a hymn. 3) vi. 75 (the ‘battle’ hymn).

paara|पार
पार,<BR> in accordance with its derivation (pṛ, ‘bring across’), denotes the ‘farther bank’ of a river or stream, in which sense 1) It also often has the generalized sense of ‘extreme limit’ or ‘end,’ as in i. 92, 6 (tamasas, ‘of darkness’); v. 54, 10 (adhavanaḥ, ‘of a road’). it occurs in the Rigveda 2) i. 121, 13 (nāvyānām, ‘of streams’); viii. 96, 11 (nadīnām); i. 167, 2 (samudrasya); x. 155, 3 (sindhoḥ), etc. and later. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 1, 2. 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiii. 5; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 6, 2, 4 (salilasya); Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 21 (pāra-kāma, ‘desiring the farther bank’), etc.

paarashavya|पारशव्य
पारशव्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Paraśu,’ is the patronymic of Tirindira in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Śūtra (xvi. 11, 20). Cf. Parśu.

paaraavata|पारावत
1. Pārāvata occurs in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’), in the Yajurveda, 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 25. meaning ‘turtle-dove.’

paaraavata|पारावत
2. Pārāvata occurs in several passages of the Rigveda. Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. thinks that in most places 2) Rv. v. 52, 11; viii. 100, 6; Av. xx. 135, 14; pārāvata-ghnī of the Sarasvatī, Rv. vi. 61, 2. it means ‘coming from a distance,’ but in two passages 3) Rv. viii. 34, 18; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ix. 4, 11. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 53. he regards it as the proper name of a people on the Yamunā (Jumna). It is certain that in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa the Pārāvatas are a people on that river (cf. Turaśravas). Hillebrandt 4) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 97 et seq.; 3, 310, following Brunnhofer, Iran und Turan, 99. sees in all the passages 5) See notes 2 and 3. the name of a people, comparing the  of Ptolemy, 6) vi. 20, 3. It is suggested by Hillebrandt that the  of Herodotus, iii. 91, may be the same. who apparently were settled on the northern border of Gedrosia, or the , who were found in  7) Ptolemy, vi. 17. He suggests that they were originally ‘mountaineers’ (Cf. Parvata). Ludwig 8) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 162. 197. holds a similar view, and Geldner 9) Rigveda, Glossar, 109. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 91; Max Mūller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 316. recognizes a people as meant. The mention of the Sarasvatī in connexion with the Pārāvatas 2) Rv. v. 52, 11; viii. 100, 6; Av. xx. 135, 14; pārāvata-ghnī of the Sarasvatī, Rv. vi. 61, 2. in the Rigveda accords generally with their position on the Yamunā in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 3) Rv. viii. 34, 18; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ix. 4, 11. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 53.

paaraashariikauNDiniiputra|पाराशरीकौण्डिनीपुत्र
पाराशरी-कौण्डिनी-पुत्र<BR> is mentioned in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhādāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 4, 30), in the Mādhyaṃdina recension, as a pupil of Gārgīputra.

Different men are no doubt meant.

paaraasharya|पाराशर्य
पाराशर्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Parāśara,’ is mentioned in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad as a pupil of Jātūkarṇya 1) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3, Kāṇva; ii. 5, 21; iv. 5, 27, Mādhyaṃdina. or of Bhāradvāja. 2) ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 26, Mādhyaṃdina; ii. 6, 2; iv. 6, 2, 3. Kāṇva. A Pārāśarya is also mentioned as a pupil of Baijavāpāyana, 3) ii. 6, 2, Kāṇva. Cf. Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, i. 9, 2. and Vyāsa Pārāśarya is the pupil of Viṣvaksena according to the Vaṃśa at the end of the Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa. 4) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 41. 1. See also Aṣāḍha, Jayanta, Vipaścit, Sudatta. 

paaraasharyaayaNa|पाराशर्यायण
पाराशर्यायण<BR> is mentioned in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1) ii. 5, 21; iv. 5, 27 (Mādhyaṃdina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3, Kāṇva). as a pupil of Pārāśarya.

paarikuTa|पारिकुट
पारिकुट<BR> is an obscure word--probably corrupt--occurring in a verse cited in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 22, 7), and apparently meaning ‘attendant.’

paarixita|पारिक्षित
पारिक्षित,<BR> ‘descendant of Parikṣit,’ is the patronymic of Janamejaya in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) vii. 27 and 34; viii. 11. and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 2) xiii. 5, 4, 1. Cf. Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 6; ii. 6, 12. The Pārikṣitīya appear in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3) xiii. 5, 4, 3. and the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 4) xvi. 9. 7. as performers of the horse sacrifice. In a Gāthā there cited they are called Pārikṣitas. Apparently they were the brothers of Janamejaya, named Ugrasena, Bhīmasena, and Śrutasena. In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5) iii. 3, 1. the question whither they have gone is made the subject of a philosophical discussion. It is clear that the family had passed away before the time of the Upaniṣad, and it is also clear that there had been some serious scandal mingled with their greatness which they had, in the opinion of the Brahmins, atoned for by their horse sacrifice with its boundless gifts to the priests. Weber 6) Indian Literature, 125, 126; 135, 136. The later legend of the Pārikṣitas and Vāmadeva's mares is dealt with by Weber in Vedische Beiträge (1894). sees in this the germ of the Epic stories which are recorded in the Mahābhārata. The verses relating to Parikṣit in the Atharvaveda 7) xx. 127, 7-10; Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xii. 17; Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 156, 157. are called Pārikṣityaḥ in the Brāhmaṇas. 8) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 32, 10; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxx. 5; Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 12; Weber, op. cit., 136, n. 144.

paariplava|पारिप्लव
पारि-प्लव,<BR> ‘cyclic,’ is a term applied to the Ākhyāna, or ‘tale,’ which is to be recited at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’), and to be repeated at intervals throughout the year. It is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 4, 3, 2. 15. and in the Sūtras. 2) Āśvalāyana Srauta Sūtra, x. 6; Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xvi. 1, 26; 2, 36; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ix. 9, 11.

paariiNahya|पारीणह्य
पारी-णह्य<BR> denotes household utensils' in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 1) vi. 2, 1, 1. where it is said that the wife (patnī), as mistress of the house, has charge of all these. 2) The word occurs later in the variant form of pāri-ṇāhya in Manu, ix. 11.

paaruuShNa|पारूष्ण
पारूष्ण,<BR> occurring in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 24. appears to mean some kind of bird.

paarovaryavid|पारोवर्यविद्
पारोवर्य-विद्<BR> in the Nirukta (xiii. 12) denotes ‘knowers of tradition.’

paarNavalki|पार्णवल्कि
पार्ण-वल्कि,<BR> ‘descendant of Parṇavalka,’ is the patronymic of Nigada in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372; Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 443.

paarthava|पार्थव
पार्थव,<BR> ‘descendant of Pṛthu,’ occurs once in the Rigveda, 1) vi. 27, 8. where the Pārthavas are mentioned as generous donors. The passage is somewhat obscure, as there is a reference 2) vi. 27, 7. to a defeat of the Turvaśas and the Vṛcīvants by Sṛñjaya Daivavāta, followed in the next verse by the praise of the bounty to the singer of Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna, who was clearly a Pārthava, and who, in the earlier part of the hymn, has been referred to as victorious over Varaśikha. It is uncertain whether, as Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 133, 134. suggests, the two princes, Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna and Sṛñjaya Daivavāta, are identical or not. 4) Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105. That Pārthava has any direct connexion with the Parthians, as held by Brunnhofer, is most improbable. 5) Cf. Ludwing, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 196 et seq. Herodotos, iii. 93, mentions the . Cf. Parśu.

paarthashravasa|पार्थश्रवस
पार्थ-श्रवस,<BR> ‘descendant of Pṛthu-śravas,’ is found as the name of a demon in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 1) iv. 26, 15. This form of the name is supported by its occurrence in the Kauśika Sūtra, ix. 10; xvii. 27. But Pārthu-is also possible.

paarthya|पार्थ्य
पार्थ्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Pṛthi,’ is the patronymic of some donor in a hymn of the Rigveda. 1) x. 93. 15. The form of the name in the Aśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra 2) xii. 10. Cf. the Anukramaṇī on Rv. x. 93. is Pārtha.

paarvati|पार्वति
पार्वति,<BR> ‘descendant of Parvata,’ is the patronymic of Dakṣa in the Śatapatha (ii. 4, 4, 6) and the Kauṣītaki (iv. 4) Brāhmaṇas.

paarShada|पार्षद
पार्षद,<BR> which first appears in the Nirukta, 1) i. 17. Cf. Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 128 et seq.; Weber, Studien, 3, 269; 4, 217. denotes a textbook recognized by a school of grammarians.

paarShadvaaNa|पार्षद्वाण
पार्षद्-वाण,<BR> ‘descendant of Pṛṣadvāṇa,’ is mentioned as a wonder-worker in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 51, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 139.

paarShNashailana|पार्ष्णशैलन
पार्ष्ण शैलन<BR> is mentioned as a teacher in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (ii. 4, 8).

paalaagala|पालागल
पालागल<BR> occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) v. 3, 1, 11. Eggeling; Sacred Books of the East, 26, 64, renders it ‘courier.’ apparently in the sense of ‘messenger,’ or ‘bearer of false news.’ 

paalaagalii|पालागली
पालागली<BR> is the name of the fourth and least respected wife of the king. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 1, 8; 5, 2, 8, etc. See Pati.

paavamaanii|पावमानी
पावमानी<BR> means the verses (ṛcas) in the ninth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda ‘relating to Soma Pavamāna’ (‘purifying itself’). The name is found in the Atharvaveda 1) xix. 71, 1. and later, 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 20; ii. 37; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xv. 1; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 8, 1, 10; Nirukta, xi. 2; xii. 31; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 2, 2, etc.; Maitrāyaṇī Gṛhya Sūtra, ii. 14. possibly even in one hymn of the Rigveda itself. 3) ix. 67, 31. 32; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 99. n. 3.

paasha|पाश
पाश<BR> denotes in the Rigveda 1) i. 24, 13. 15; ii. 27, 16; 29, 5. etc. and later 2) Av. ii. 12, 2; ix. 3, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vi. 8. 45, etc. a ‘rope’ used for fastening or tying up. Rope and knot (granthi) are mentioned together in the Atharvaveda. 3) ix. 3, 2. Pāśa is in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 4) i. 8, 1, 5. used of the rope by which Manu's ship was fastened to the mountain. It is often employed metaphorically of the ‘fetter’ of Varuṇa. 5) Rv. vi. 74, 4; vii. 88, 7; x. 85, 24; Av. iv. 16, 6; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 5, 1, etc.

paashin|पाशिन्
पाशिन्,<BR> ‘having a noose,’ denotes a ‘hunter’ in the Rigveda 1) iii. 45, 1; ix. 73, 4. So of Nirṛti in Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 10. and in the Atharvaveda. 2) xvii. 1, 8.

paashadyumnavaayata|पाशद्युम्नवायत
पाश-द्युम्न वायत<BR> is the name of a king to whom the Vasiṣṭhas claim to have been preferred by Indra in one hymn of the Rigveda. 1) vii. 33. 2. Apparently he was, as Sāyaṇa says, son of Vayat, who may be compared with the Vyat of another passage of the Rigveda. 2) i. 122, 4. Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173. sees in him a priest of the Pṛthus and Parśus, but this is most improbable. 4) Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 130, 139.

paaShya|पाष्य
पाष्य<BR> occurs in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 56, 6. with reference to the defeat of Vṛtra, and apparently denotes ‘stone bulwarks.’ In another passage 2) ix. 102, 2. Cf. Macdone, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1893, 457, 458. the word may mean the stones used for pressing Soma.

pika|पिक
पिक,<BR> the Indian ‘cuckoo,’ is mentioned in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 15, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 20; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 39. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 92. Cf. Anyavāpa, Koka.

pingaa|पिङ्गा
पिङ्गा<BR> is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 69, 9. where it is explained by the St. Petersburg Dictionary with Sāyaṇa as ‘bowstring,’ but where Hillebrandt 2) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 144, n. thinks that a musical instrument of some kind is meant.

pijavana|पिजवन
पिजवन<BR> is the name of the father of Sudās according to the Nirukta. 1) ii. 24. Probably this statement is based on a mere conjecture from the epithet Paijavana used of Sudās in a verse of the Rigveda, 2) vii. 18, 19. So Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 21. but may very well be correct.

pinjuula|पिञ्जूल
पिञ्जूल<BR> denotes a ‘bundle’ of grass or stalks, especially of Darbha. The word is only found in the Brāhmaṇa style. 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiii. 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xviii. 8. It appears in the form of piñjula in Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 8, 7; Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 15; of Puñjīla in Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 1, 7; 2, 4, 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 6, 4; ii. 7, 9, 5.

piThiinas|पिठीनस्
पिठीनस्<BR> is the name of a man, a friend of Indra, in the Rigveda. 1) vi. 26, 6. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 156.

piNDa|पिण्ड
पिण्ड,<BR> denoting specifically a ball of flour offered to the Manes, especially on the evening of new moon, occurs in the Nirukta, 1) iii. 4. and repeatedly in the Sūtras. 2) Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ii. 10, 4, etc. 

pitaaputra|पितापुत्र
पिता-पुत्र,<BR> ‘father and son,’ is a compound of rare occurrence. 1) Av. vi. 112, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2, 4, 4.

pitaaputriiya|पितापुत्रीय
पिता-पुत्रीय<BR> (‘relating to father and son’), used with Sampradāna (‘handing over’) means the ceremony by which a father, when about to die, bequeathes his bodily and mental powers to his son. It is described in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad. 1) ii. 15. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 408.

pitaamaha|पितामह
पिता-मह,<BR> beside Tatāmaha, denotes from the Atharvaveda onwards 1) Av. v. 5, 1; ix. 5, 30; xi. 1, 19; xviii. 4, 35; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 5, 1; vii. 2, 7, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 36; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 5, 4. the ‘paternal grandfather,’ apparmtly as a ‘father in a higher sense.’ 2) Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 474. The great-grandfather is Prapitāmaha and Pratatāmaha. 3) Av. xviii. 4, 75. It is significant that there are no corrésponding Vedic words for maternal grandparents, and that the words used in the latter language, such as Mātāmaha, are imitations of the terms for paternal relations. In one passage of the Rigveda 4) vi. 20. 11. Delbrück 5) Ibid., 473. suggests that mahe pitre means ‘grandfather,’ a sense which would well suit the napātam, ‘grandson,’ following, but the sense of the whole passage is uncertain. 6) See Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 128, n. 1. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., also doubts the view which is accepted by Delbrück, and denies that in Rv. i. 71, 5, the sense of ‘grandfather’ can be found. We learn very little from the texts of the position of grandparents. No doubt they were entitled to marks of respect similar to those shown to parents, 7) Delbrück, op. cit., 480, citing Mahābhārata, ii. 1634. as the epic expressly testifies. A grandfather might easily be the head of the family, or be living with his eldest son, after he ceased to be able to control the family. The grandmother (Pitāmahī) is not mentioned in the extant Vedic literature. 

pitu|पितु
पितु<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 61, 7; 132, 6; 187, 1; vi. 20, 4, etc. and later 2) Av. iv. 6, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 7, 2, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ii. 20; xii. 65; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 13. has the general sense of ‘nutriment,’ whether food or drink.

pitR|पितृ
पितृ,<BR> common from the Rigveda onwards, denotes ‘father,’ not so much as the ‘begetter’ (janitṛ), 1) Pitā janitā, is used of gods in the Rigveda--e.g., iv. 17, 12. but rather as the protector of the child, this being probably also the etymological sense of the word. 2) As derived from pā, ‘protect.’ But, as Böhtlingk and Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Mātar, footnote, suggest, pa and mā were probably the much older original onomatopoetic names for ‘father’ and ‘mother,’ which in a later reflective age influenced the formation of pitṛ and mātṛ (which themselves go back to the Indo-European period). The father in the Rigveda 3) See, e.g., iv. 17, 17; viii. 86, 4. stands for all that is good and kind. Hence Agni is compared with a father, 4) Rv. x. 7, 3. while Indra is even dearer than a father. 5) Rv. vii. 32, 19; viii. 1, 6. The father carries his son in his arms, 6) Rv. i. 38, 1. and places him on his lap, 7) Rv. v. 43, 7. while the child pulls his garment to attract attention. 8) Rv. iii. 53, 2. In later years the son depends on his father for help in trouble, 9) In Rv. x. 48, 1, the jantavaḥ possibly are the sons. and greets him with joy. 10) Rv. vii. 103, 3. Cf. 1, 24, 1. It is difficult to ascertain precisely how far the son was subject to parental control, and how long such control continued. Reference is made in the Rigveda 11) Rv. ii. 29, 5. to a father's chastising his son for gambling, and Ṛjrāśva is said to have been blinded by his father. 12) Rv. i. 116, 16; 117, 17. There is also the case of the sale of Sunaḥśepa, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 12-18; and cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 3, 3. From the latter statement Zimmer 13) Altindisches Leben, 316. infers the existence of a developed patria potestas, but to lay stress on this isolated and semi-mythical incident would be unwise. It is, however, quite likely that the patria potestas was originally strong, for we have other support for the thesis in the Roman patria potestas. If there is no proof that a father legally controlled his son's wedding, 14) Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 576. Ibid., 582, he quotes Mahābhārata, xii. 6108 et seq., which refers in one line to the control of the marriage of the son by the father, and in the next to a case of free marriage. The fact is, no doubt, that the son could marry freely, unless his father had arranged matters for him when he was too young to object. and not much that he controlled his daughter's, 15) Zimmer, op. cit., 309, assumes this as certain, but it is far from proved. See, however, Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 12, 2, which is in favour of Zimmer's view. Cf. Kaegi, Dev Rigveda, 15, and Pati. the fact is in itself not improbable. There is again no evidence to show whether a son, when grown up, normally continued to stay with his father, his wife becoming a member of the father's household, or whether he set up a house of his own: probably the custom varied. Nor do we know whether the son was granted a special plot of land on marriage or otherwise, or whether he only came into such property after his father's death. But any excessive estimate of the father's powers over a son who was no longer a minor and naturally under his control, must be qualified by the fact that in his old age the sons might divide their father's property, 16) Rv. i. 70, 10; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 14; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 156 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 61, 62). or he might divide it amongst them, 17) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 9, 4-6. Cf. the handing over from father to son in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, ii. 15. If the father recovered, he lived subject to his son. and that when the father-in-law became aged he fell under the control of his son's wife. 18) Rv. x. 85, 46. There are also obscure traces that in old age a father might be exposed, though there is no reason to suppose that this was usual in Vedic India. 19) Cf. Rv. viii. 51, 2; Av. xviii. 2, 34. The first passage need not refer to exposure, and the second merely refers to the exposure of a dead body; but Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 326-328, thinks that they prove exposure. Cf. Dharma. Normally the son was bound to give his father full obedience. 20) Rv. i. 68, 5 The later Sūtras show in detail the acts of courtesy which he owed his father, and they allow him to eat the remnants of his father's food. 21) Āpastamba Dharma Sūtra, i. 1, 4, 11. On the other hand, the father was expected to be kind. The story of Śunaḥśepa in the Aitareya Brāh maṇa 22) vii. 12 et seq.; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 17 et seq. emphasizes the horror with which the father's heartless treatment of his son was viewed. The Upaniṣads 23) E.g., Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, ii. 15; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 5, 25 (Mādhyaṃdina = i. 5, 17, Kāṇva). insist on the spiritual succession from father to son. The kissing of a son 24) See Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 28, 120-134; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 26, n. 3. was a frequent and usual token of affection, even in mature years. On the failure of natural children, adoption was possible. 25) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 318; Mayr, Indisches Erbrecht, 73; Jolly, Die Adoption in Indien (Würzburg, 1910), 7 et seq. It was even resorted to when natural children existed, but when it was desired to secure the presence in the family of a person of specially high qualifications, as in Viśvāmitra's adoption of Śunaḥśepa. 26) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 17 et seq.; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 17. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 157. It is not clear that adoption from one caste into another was possible, for there is no good evidence that Viśvāmitra was, as Weber 27) Episches im vedischen Ritual, 33, 34. holds, a Kṣatriya who adopted a Brāhmaṇa. Adoption was also not always in high favour: it may be accidental or not that a hymn of the Vasiṣṭha book of the Rigveda 28) vii. 4, 7. 8. condemns the usage. It was also possible for the father who had a daughter, but no sons, to appoint her to bear a son for him. At any rate the practice appears to be referred to in an obscure verse of the Rigveda 29) iii. 31, 1. as interpreted by Yāska. 30) iii. 5 ad fin. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 343; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 34; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 239-241. Moreover, it is possible that the difficulty of a brotherless maiden finding a husband 31) Cf. Bhrātṛ. may have been due in part to the possibility of her father desiring to make her a Putrikā, the later technical name for a daughter whose son is to belong to her father's family. There can be no doubt that in a family the father took precedence of the mother. 32) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 1, 18; a citation in Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 9; Chāndogya Upaniṣad vii. 15, 2. Delbrück 33) Die {|indogermanischen|} Verwandtschaftsnamen, 577. explains away the apparent cases to the contrary. 34) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 7, 5. Some passages in the Sūtras present difficulties, but they are of no importance for Vedic times proper. There is no trace of the family as a land-owning corporation. 35) Baden Powell, whose various works (Indian Village Community, 1896; Village Communities in India, 1899, etc.) have done most to combat the view of the village community in India as a land-holding institution, is prepared to recognize the family as a land-owning unit, considering that the patria potestas is a later growth, and not Indian (see, e.g., Village Communities in India, 128 et seq.). Hopkins, India, Old and New, 218 et seq., adopts a theory which allows of individual and joint family ownership side by side, the latter being apparently the earlier but the decadent stage. He expressly considers (p. 222) that the son had an indefeasible right to prevent the father from alienating the hereditary land, which could only be parted with by the consent of the village if it were a case of joint ownership (cf. the verse cited by Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 94). But it must be remembered that, as is very clearly shown in the case of English law by Pollock and Maitland (History of English Law, 2, 337-352), the recognition of the rights of sons may well be, not a sign of original joint or family ownership, but a development from the existence of intestate succession, and as in England, so in India, there is no trace of a corporate joint family in the early books. And, as Jolly (op. cit., 76, 80) shows, there are clear traces, both in old and modern times, of a despotic control of the family by the father even after his sons grew up, provided only that he was physically able to control them. The same state of affairs seems proved for early English law, as it is beyond question for Roman law (see Smith's Dictionary of Antiquities, 2, 351 et seq.). In Greece also, which is sometimes contrasted with Rome, there is the clearest trace of both a real patria potestas, and of the absolute ownership of the land by the father as against the son, especially in the archaic laws of Gortyn (see Gardner and Jevons, Greek Antiquities, 404, 405, 563, 566). The dual form Pitarau regularly means ‘father and mother,’ ‘parents.’ 36) Rv. i. 20, 4; 160, 3; ii. 17, 7; vii. 67, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiii 10; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 11, etc.

pitRyaaNa|पितृयाण
पितृ-याण,<BR> the ‘way of the fathers,’ mentioned in the Rigveda 1) x. 2, 7. Cf. the allusion to it in x. 18, 1, as other than the Devavāna, which appears in x. 98, 11. and later, 2) Av. viii. 10, 19; xii. 2, 10, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 45; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 3, 2, etc. is opposed to the Deva-yāna, or ‘way of the gods.’ Tilak 3) Orion, 22 et seq. considers that the Devayāna corresponds with the Uttarāyaṇa, ‘northern journey’ of the sun, and the Pitṛyāṇa with the Dakṣiṇāyana, its ‘southern journey.’ He concludes from a passage of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 4) ii. 1, 3, 1-3. where three of the seasons--spring, summer, and the rains--are ascribed to the gods, but the others to the Pitṛs, or Fathers, that the Devayāna began with the vernal equinox, and the Pitṛyāṇa with the autumnal equinox. With this he connects the curious distinction of Devaand Yama-Nakṣatras in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 5) i. 5, 2, 6. These conclusions are, however, very improbable. Cf. Nakṣatra and Sūrya.

pitRhan|पितृहन्
पितृ-हन्,<BR> ‘parricide,’ is found in the Atharvaveda, 1) ix. 4, 3. Cf. Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. Paippalāda recension.

pitrya|पित्र्य
पित्र्य<BR> occurs in the list of sciences given in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 1) vii. 1, 2, 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 267; Little, Grammatical Index, 98. Apparently it is to be taken as the science relating to the cult of the Manes, as explained by Śaṅkara in his commentary. As it is in that list followed by Rāśi, the St. Petersburg Dictionary is inclined to take Pitrya Rāśi as one expression, but in what exact sense does not appear.

pitva|पित्व
पित्व<BR> 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 17, 1. or Pidva 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 13; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 32. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 79; Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 29, 290. is the name of an animal included in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. According to the commentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 17, 1. it means ‘lion.’ But it may be identical with Petva.

pinaaka|पिनाक
पिनाक,<BR> ‘club,’ is found in the Atharvaveda. 1) i. 27, 2. Later 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 6, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 61; xvi. 51. etc. it is used to denote the club of Rudra-Śiva.

pinvana|पिन्वन
पिन्वन<BR> occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 1, 2, 17; 2, 1, 11; 3, 1, 22) as the name of a vessel used in the ritual.

pipiila|पिपील
पिपील,<BR> ‘ant,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda (x. 16, 6) as eating the flesh of the dead. 

pipiilikaa|पिपीलिका
पिपीलिका<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) vii. 56, 7. Cf. xx. 134. 6. and later 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 6, 7; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 6, 10; xv. 17, 8; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 4, 9. 29 (Mādhyaṃdina = i. 4, 4, 16 Kāṇva); Nirukta, vii. 13; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, i. 3, 8; ii. 1, 6. denotes an ‘ant,’ the form of the word referring doubtless not so much to the small species of ant, as it is taken in the later lexicons, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. but rather to the insect's tiny size, which would naturally be expressed by a diminutive formation of the name. The form Pipīlaka 4) Cf. kanīnaka beside kanīnikā, ‘pupil of the eye.’ is found in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 5) vii. 2, 1; 7, 1; 8, 1; 10, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 97; Edgerton, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 31, 128.

pippakaa|पिप्पका
पिप्पका<BR> is mentioned in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 19, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 21; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 40. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93. Some bird seems to be meant.

pippala|पिप्पल
पिप्पल,<BR> n., is found in two passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 164, 20 = Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad, iii. 1, 1; Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad, iv. 6, 22; v. 54, 12 (the ‘berry’ of heaven, nāka). meaning ‘berry,’ used with a mystic signification, and in neither case with any certain reference to the berry of the fig-tree. 2) The word Pippala appears in the later literature as a masculine, denoting the Ficus veligiosa (Aśvattha in Vedic literature). In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3) iv. 1, 41. the general sense of ‘berry’ is not necessary, and the special sense of ‘berry’ of the Peepal is quite possible: the latter meaning is perhaps intended in the Satapatha Brāhmana. 4) iii. 7, 1, 12. In the Atharvaveda 5) vi. 109, 1, 2. the feminine form of the word, Pippalī, appears denoting berries used as a remedy for wounds, like Arundhatī. 6) Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 61; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 516; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 359, 360; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 389; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 331. 

pippalaada|पिप्पलाद
पिप्पलाद<BR> (‘eater of berries’) is the name of a teacher mentioned in the Praśna Upaniṣad. 1) i. 1. In the plural the name denotes a school of the Atharvaveda. 2) Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 277; Indian Literature, 153, 159, 160, 164. Their (Paippalāda) recension of the text of the Saṃhitā has been reproduced in facsimile by Garbe and Bloomfield, 3) Baltimore, 1901. and in part published. 4) The variants of the Paippalāda are given in part in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, and the text of books i. and ii. has been edited by Barret in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 197-295; 30, 187 et seq. Cf. also Lanman in Whitney's Translation, lxxix et seq.

pipru|पिप्रु
पिप्रु<BR> is the name of a foe of Indra in the Rigveda. He was repeatedly defeated by Indra for Ṛjiśvan. 1) i. 101, 1, 2; iv. 16, 13; v. 29, 11; vi. 20, 7; viii. 49, 10; x. 99, 11; 138, 3. In i. 103, 8; ii. 14, 5; vi. 18, 8, the reference is general to a defeat of Pipru by Indra. Mentioned as possessing forts, 2) Rv. i. 51, 5; vi. 20, 7. he is called a Dāsa 3) Rv. viii. 32, 2. as well as an Asura. 4) Rv. x. 138, 3. He is described as having a black brood, 5) Rv. i. 101, 1. and as being allied with blacks. 6) iv. 16, 13. It is uncertain whether he was a demon, according to Roth's 7) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. view, which is favoured by the use of the word Asura, or a human foe, as Ludwig, 8) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 149. Oldenberg, 9) Religion des Veda, 155. and Hillebrandt 10) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 273. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 161 (C). believe. The name may mean ‘resister,’ from the root pṛ.

pisha|पिश
पिश<BR> is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 64, 8. Cf. Av. xix. 49, 4; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 118; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 110. where Sāyaṇa takes it to mean a deer (ruru).

pishanga|पिशङ्ग
पिशङ्ग<BR> is the name of one of the two Unnetṛ priests officiating at the snake festival mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35. Cf. Caka. 

pishaacha|पिशाच
पिशाच<BR> is the name of a class of demon mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 18, 4; iv. 20, 6. 9; 36, 4; 37, 10; v. 29, 4. 5. 14; vi. 32, 2; viii. 2, 12; xii. 1, 50. The word occurs once in the Rv. (i. 133, 5) in the form of Piśāci. and later. 2) See St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 3) ii. 4, 1, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 14. they are associated with Rakṣases and Asuras, while opposed to gods, men, and fathers. In the Atharvaveda 4) v. 25, 9. they are described as kravyād, ‘eaters of raw flesh,’ which may be the etymological sense of the word Piśāca itself. 5) Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 264, n. It is possible that the Piśācas were, as suggested by Grierson, 6) Cf. Grierson, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1905, 285-288. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 164 (B). really human foes, like the north-western tribes, who even in later times were reputed eaters of raw flesh (not necessarily as cannibals, but rather as eaters of human flesh in ritual). This is, however, not at all likely, the Piśācas having in all probability only meant ‘ghouls’ originally: when they appear as human tribes, they were presumably thus designated in scorn. A science called Piśācaveda 7) Gopatha Brāhmaṇa. i. 1, 10. or Piśāca-vidyā 8) Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 7, 6. is known in the later Vedic period.

pishita|पिशित
पिशित<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 19, 5. and later 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 11; Kauśika Sūtra, xii. 8; xxxv. 18; xxxix. 14. etc. denotes raw flesh (of. Piśāca). In one passage of the Atharvaveda 3) vi. 127, 1. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 531; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 376. the sense seems to be ‘small piece,’ ‘bit,’ but the St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests that Piśita here stands for piṣita, equivalent to piṣṭa (what is ‘pounded,’ then ‘particle’).

pishiila|पिशील
पिशील<BR> is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ii. 5, 3, 6) as the name of a wooden vessel or dish. In the Lāṭyāyana Śrautā Sūtra (iv. 2, 4. 5) a Piśīla-vīṇā is mentioned, which seems to have been a kind of guitar, with strings stretched over a body of wood. 

pishuna|पिशुन
पिशुन,<BR> ‘traitor,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) vii. 104, 20. and occasionally later. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 13; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vii. 6, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 7, 1.

piShTa|पिष्ट
पिष्ट<BR> (‘pounded’), n., ‘meal,’ ‘flour,’ is mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 9; Śatapatha Brāhṃaṇa, i. 1, 4, 3; 2, 1, 2; vi. 5, 1, 6, etc. In the Atharvaveda 2) xii. 2, 53. reference is made to pounded beans (māṣāḥ).

piiTha|पीठ
पीठ,<BR> ‘stool,’ does not occur as an uncompounded word before the Sūtras, but the compound pīṭha-sarpin (‘moving about in a little cart’) is found as the designation of a ‘cripple’ in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (xxx. 21) and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 4, 17, 1) in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’).

piitudaaru|पीतुदारु
पीतु-दारु<BR> is found in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxv. 6. and later 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 2, 15; xiii. 4, 4, 5, 17; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxiv. 13, 5. denoting the Deodar (deva-dāru) tree, or, according to others, the Khadira or Udumbara tree. 3) Mahīdhara on Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, v. 14; Sāyaṇa on Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 28. Cf. Pūtadru.

piiyuuSha|पीयूष
पीयूष<BR> is found in the Rigveda 1) Cf. ii. 35, 5, where it is applied figuratively to the mothers of Agni. and later 2) Kauśika Sūtra, xix. 15. Cf. Av. viii. 9, 24. in the sense of the first milk of the cow after calving, ‘biestings.’ Usually the term is applied metaphorically to the sap of the Soma plant. 3) Rv. ii. 13, 1; iii. 48, 2; vi. 47, 4; x. 94, 8, etc. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 110.

piilaa|पीला
पीला<BR> occurs once in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 37, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 69; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 211. as the name of an  Apsaras, being no doubt originally a name of some fragrant plant, like Naladī and Guggulū, two other names of Apsarases given in the same verse.

piilu|पीलु
पीलु<BR> is the name in the Atharvaveda 1) xx. 135, 12. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62; Weber, Transactions of the Berlin Academy, 1895, 861. of a tree (Careya arborea or Salvadora persica) on the fruit of which doves fed.

पीलुमती<BR> is in the Atharvaveda (xviii. 2, 48) the name of the intermediate heaven lying between the udanuvatī, ‘watery,’ and the pra-dyauḥ, ‘farthest heaven.’ It presumably means ‘rich in Pīlu.’ Cf. Div.

puMshchalii|पुंश्चली
पुंश्-चली<BR> (‘running after men’) is found in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 1) xxx. 22. the Atharvaveda, 2) xv. 2, 1 et seq. and later, 3) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, viii. 1, 10; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxvii. 1; Lāṭyāyana Srauta Sūtra, iv. 3, 9, 11. to denote a ‘wanton woman.’ In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 4) xxx. 5. 20; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 1, 1; 15, 1; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 3, 6. also occurs the form Puṃścalū. See also Dharma and Pati.

puMsavana|पुंसवन
पुं-सवन<BR> (‘male-production’ ceremony) is found in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 11, 1. in a hymn which is obviously intended to accompany a rite aiming at securing the birth of a male child and which is so applied in the ritual. 2) Kauśika Sūtra, xxxv. 8. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 460; whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 288. The later Gṛhya ritual knows a special rite called Puṃsavana. See Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 13; Sāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 20; Gobhila Gṛhya Sūtra, ii. 6, 1 et seq.; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 41.

Pauñjiṣṭha. 

punjiila|पुञ्जील
पुञ्जील<BR> is found in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) vi. 1, 1, 7; 2, 4, 3. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 2) i. 7, 6, 4; ii. 7, 9, 5. in the sense of a ‘bundle’ of grass, being a variant of Piñjūla.

puNDariika|पुण्डरीक

The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 3) xviii. 9, 6. states that the lotus flower is born of the light of the Nakṣatras, and the Atharvaveda 4) x. 8, 43; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 1, 1. compares the human heart to the lotus. 5) In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 18, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 2, 1, puṇḍari-srajā denotes a ‘wreath of lotus leaves.’ Cf.

Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 56, 553; Būhler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, 148; Oldenberg, Buddha, 394, n. For the later geographical position of the Puṇḍras, cf. the map in Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 333. In the Epic their country corresponds with Bengal and Bihar.

putra|पुत्र
पुत्र<BR> is, with Sūnu, the usual name for ‘son’ from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. ii. 29, 5; v. 47, 6; vi. 9, 2, etc.; Av. iii. 30, 2, etc. The original sense of the word was apparently ‘small,’ or something analogous. 2) Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 454. The form Putraka 3) Rv. viii. 69, 8; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 14; vi. 33 (here the narrative uses Putra; the reported words have Putraka); Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 6, 1, 2; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 21, etc. is often used with the distinct intention of an affectionate address to a younger man, not merely a son proper. Reference is frequently made to the desire for a son. 4) Rv. x. 183, 1; Av. vi. 81, 3; xi. 1, 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 6, 1; vii. 1, 8, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 9, 1. Cf. Pati. 

putrasena|पुत्रसेन
पुत्र-सेन<BR> is the name of a man in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (iv. 6, 6).

putrikaa|पुत्रिका
पुत्रिका<BR> in the later literature 1) Mānava Dharma Śāstra, ix. 127 et seq.; Gautama Dharma Sūtra, xxviii. 20; Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, xvii. 17. has the technical sense of the daughter of a man without sons, whom he gives in marriage on the express terms that her son shall perform the funeral rites for him, and be counted as his. The thing as well as the name is recognized by Yāska in the Nirukta, 2) iii. 5 ad fin. and traced to the Rigveda. 3) i. 124, 7. Cf. iii. 31, 1. But the passages in the Rigveda are of very uncertain meaning, 4) Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 34; Rigveda, Kommentar, 48, 49; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 239 et seq.; Roth, Nirukta,' Erlāuterungen, 27; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 72, 73; Bṛhaddevatā, iv. 110. 111, with Macdonell's note; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 924, 925; Jolly, Die Adoption in Indien, 32. and in all probability do not refer to this custom at all.

punardatta|पुनर्दत्त
पुनर्-दत्त<BR> (‘given again’) is the name of a teacher in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka (viii. 8).

punarbhuu|पुनर्भू

punarvasu|पुनर्वसु
पुनर्-वसु<BR> (‘bringing goods again’), used in the dual, denotes the fifth in the series of the Vedic Nakṣatras, or ‘Lunar Mansions.’ Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. takes the word to have this sense in its only occurrence in the Rigveda, 2) x. 19, 1. but this must be regarded as decidedly doubtful. The term is, however, found in the ordinary lists of the Nakṣatras in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. 3) Av. xix. 7, 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 5, 1, 4; iv. 4, 10, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 3; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, i. 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, viii. 15; xxxix. 13; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2, 10, etc. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 289, 290; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 355.

पुनः-सर,<BR> ‘recurrent,’ is the epithet of the barking dog in the Rigveda, 1) vii. 55, 3; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 56, n. 1. which is told to bark at the thief. It refers, not doubt, to the dog's practice of running to and fro when it barks. It is also applied to a plant, Apāmārga (Achyranthes aspera), in the Atharvaveda, 2) iv. 17, 2; vi. 129, 3; x. 1, 9. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 179. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 394, prefers the sense of ‘attacking,’ which is the meaning of prati-sara, Av. viii. 5, 5. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 4, 20. with the sense of ‘having revertent leaves.’

pumaaMs|पुमांस्
पुमांस्<BR> denotes in the Rigveda 1) i. 124, 7; 162, 22; iii. 29, 13; iv. 3, 10, etc. and later 2) Av. iii. 6, 1; 23, 3; iv. 4, 4; vi. 11, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, viii. 5, etc. man as the ‘male.’ It has no special reference to marriage like Pati, or to heroism like Nṛ or Nara. In grammar it denotes the masculine gender. 3) Nirukta, iii. 8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 1, 1, 8; 5, 1, 3; Cf. iv. 5, 2, 10, and puṃṣā nakṣatreṇa, ‘a Nakṣatra with a masculine name,’ in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 3, 1.

pur|पुर्
पुर्<BR> is a word of frequent occurrence in the Rigveda 1) i. 53, 7, 58, 8; 131, 4; 166, 8; iii. 15, 4; iv. 27, 1, etc. and later, 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 7, 5; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 23; ii. 11; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 4, 3; vi. 3, 3, 25; xi. 1, 1, 2, 3; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 5, 3, etc. meaning ‘rampart,’ ‘fort,’ or ‘stronghold.’ Such fortifications must have been occasionally of considerable size, as one is called ‘broad’ (pṛthvī) and ‘wide’ (urvī). 3) i. 189, 2. Elsewhere 4) Rv. iv. 30, 20. Perhaps sun-dried bricks are alluded to by āmā (lit. ‘raw,’ ‘unbaked’) in Rv. ii. 35, 6. a fort ‘made of stone’ (aśmamayī) is mentioned. Sometimes strongholds ‘of iron’ (āyasī) are referred to, 5) Rv. i. 58, 8; ii. 20, 8; iv. 27, 1. vii. 3, 7; 15, 4; 95, 1; x. 101, 8. See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2^2, 378 et seq. but these are probably only metaphorical. A fort ‘full of kine’ (gomatī) is mentioned, 6) Av. viii. 6, 23. showing that strongholds were used to hold cattle. ‘Autumnal’ (śāradī) forts are named, apparently as belonging to the Dāsas: this may refer to the forts in that season being occupied against Āryan attacks or against inundations caused by overflowing rivers. Forts ‘with a hundred walls’ (śatabhuji) are spoken of. 7) Rv. i. 166, 8; vii. 15, 14. It would probably be a mistake to regard these forts as premanently occupied fortified places like the fortresses of the mediæval barony. They were probably merely places of refuge against attack, ramparts of hardened earth with palisades and a ditch (cf. Dehī). Pischel and Geldner, 8) Vedische Studien, 1, xxii, xxiii, where kṣiti dhruvā, i. 73, 4, is compared. however, think that there were towns with wooden walls and ditches ( and ) like the Indian town of Pāṭaliputra known to Megasthenes 9) Strabo, p. 702; Arrian, Indica, 10. and the Pāli texts. 10) Mahāparinibbānasutta, p. 12. Cf. Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 262. This is possible, but hardly susceptible of proof, and it is not without significance that the word Nagara is of late occurrence. On the whole it is hardly likely that in early Vedic times city life was much developed. In the Epic, according to Hopkins, 11) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 77; 174 et seq. there are found the Nagara, ‘city’; Grāma, ‘village’; and Ghoṣa, ‘ranch.’ Vedic literature hardly seems to go beyond the village, no doubt with modifications in its later period. The siege of forts is mentioned in the Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas. 12) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 3, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 23; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 4, 3-5; Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 7, etc. According to the Rigveda, 13) vii. 5, 3. Possibly, in some cases, the palisade was no more than a hedge of thorn or a row of stakes (cf. Rv. x. 101, 8), as suggested by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 143, 145; and cf. Rv. viii. 53, 5, as corrected by Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 109. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 142148, who compares the fact that neither the Germans (Tacitus, Germania, 16) nor the Slavs (Procopius, De bello Gotico, iii. 14) lived in towns, but, like the ancient Indians, were scattered in villages, each consisting of the houses and steadings of the several families living in the village. The evidence seems pretty convincing. It is true that the Greeks, when we first find them, evidently knew castles and fortresses of the mediæval type; but the Greeks were clearly an invading race, superimposed on an older and in civilization more advanced people (see, e.g., Burrows, Discoveries in Crete). But the Pur may, as Zimmer allows, have sometimes been built within the limits of the village. Whether, as he urges (144), the śāradī pur was a protection against the floods of antumn is uncertain. Cf. Rv. i. 131, 4; 174, 2; vi. 20, 10. In particular, it is not legitimate to connect the mention of those forts with the fact that the Pūrus lived on either side of the Sindhu (Indus), and to assume that Purukutsa's attack on the aborigines was directed against the forts in which they normally protected themselves on the rising of the river. No argument for the large size of cities can be drawn from the mention in the Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad, v. 1, of ekādaśa-dvāra as an epithet of Pura (cf. Śvetāśvatara Upaniśad, iii. 18; nava-dvāra pura, ‘the citadel of nine doors’), because it is used metaphorically of the body, and the number of doors depends on the nature of the body (Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 185). The evidence of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 1, 1, 2, 3, seems rather to point to only one gate in a city. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 412; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 451; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 229; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 203, and Mahāpur. fire was used. 

puraMdhi|पुरंधि
पुरं-धि<BR> occurs in the Rigveda, 1) i. 116, 13. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 398. possibly as the name of a woman, a protégée of the Aśvins, who gave her a son, Hiraṇyahasta.

puraya|पुरय
पुरय<BR> is the name of a patron celebrated in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda. 1) vi. 63, 9. Cf. Ludwing, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158.

puraaNa|पुराण
1. Purāṇa, denoting a tale ‘of olden times,’ is often found 1) Satāpatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 6, 8; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iii. 4, 1. 2; vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. in the combination Itihāsa-Purāṇa, which is probably a Dvandva compound meaning ‘Itihāsa and Purāṇa.’ It sometimes 2) Av. xv. 6, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 3, 13; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii 4, 10; iv. 1, 2; 5, 11; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 9; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 53; Purāṇa-veda: Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 2, 27; Purāṇavidyā: Āśvalāyana Srauta Sūtra, x. 7, etc. occurs as a separate word, but beside Itihāsa, no doubt with the same sense as in the Dvandva. Sāyaṇa 3) Introduction to Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, cited by St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. defines a Purāṇa as a tale which deals with the primitive condition of the universe and the creation of the world, but there is no ground for supposing that this view is correct, or for clearly distinguishing Itihāsa and Purāṇa. See Itihāsa.

puraaNa|पुराण
2. Purāṇa is the name of a Ṛṣi in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (xxxix. 7). 

puriikaya|पुरीकय
पुरीकय<BR> is the name of a water animal in the Atharvaveda, 1) xi. 2, 25. being clearly a variant of the name that appears as Pulīkaya in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 2) iii. 14, 2. Pulīkā, ibid., 5, is a variant of Kulīkā. and as Kulīpaya in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 3) xxiv. 21. 35. and as Kulīkaya in the Taittirī, Brāhmaṇa. 4) v. 5, 13, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 96; Bloomfield, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 557; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 621. What animal is meant is quite unknown.

puriiShiNii|पुरीषिणी
पुरीषिणी<BR> is found in a hymn of the Rigveda 1) v. 53, 9. apparently either as the name of a river, 2) An alternative suggested by Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. or much more probably as an epithet of the Sarayu, 3) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 17; Geldner, Riveda, Glossar, 111. meaning, perhaps, ‘abounding in water,’ ‘swollen,’ 4) Geldner, loc. cit. or ‘carrying rubble.’ 5) Roth, loc. cit.

purukutsa|पुरुकुत्स
पुरु-कुत्स<BR> is the name of a king who is mentioned several times in the Rigveda. In one passage 1) i. 63, 7. he is mentioned as a contemporary of Sudās, but whether as a foe, according to Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 174, emending sudāse in the text to sudāsam, plausibly, but not, of course, convincingly. or merely as a contemporary, according to Hillebrandt, 3) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 115. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 204. 205, 219. is uncertain. In two other passages 4) i. 112, 7, 14; 174, 2. he is mentioned as victorious by divine favour, and in another 5) vi. 20, 10. Cf. i. 63, 7, where Pūru also is mentioned. Ludwig suggests reading in vi. 20, 10, saudāsīḥ for dāsīḥ, referring to the forts of Sudās; but this must be regarded as illegitimate. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift, 55, 330. he appears as a king of the Pūrus and a conqueror of the Dāsas. His son was Trasadasyu, 6) Rv. iv. 42, 8. 9. who is accordingly called Paurukutsya 7) Rv. v. 33, 8; viii. 19, 36. or Paurukutsi. 8) Rv. vii. 19, 3. Different conclusions have been drawn from one hymn of the Rigveda 9) Rv. iv. 42, 8. 9, with Sāyaṇa's note; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 266, 267. in which the birth of Purukutsa's son, Trasadasyu, is mentioned. The usual interpretation is that Purukutsa was killed in battle or captured, whereupon his wife secured a son to restore the fortunes of the Pūrus. But Sieg 10) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 96-102. offers a completely different interpretation. According to him the word daurgahe, which occurs in the hymn, and which in the ordinary view is rendered ‘descendant of Durgaha,’ an ancestor of Purukutsa, is the name of a horse, the hymn recording the success of an Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) undertaken by Purukutsa for his wife, as by kings in later times, to secure a son. This interpretation is supported by the version of daurgahe given in the Śatapatha, 11) xiii. 5, 4, 5. but is by no means certain. Moreover, if Purukutsa was a contemporary of Sudās, the defeat of the Pūrus by Sudās in the Dāśarājña 12) vii. 18. Cf. also the reference to a Pūru defeat in vii. 8, 4. might well have been the cause of the troubles from which Purukutsānī, by the birth of Trasadasyu, rescued the family. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13) xiii. 5, 4, 5. Cf. Ikṣvāku, Tryaruṇa, and Oldenberg, Buddha, 403. Purukutsa is called an Aikṣvāka.

purukutsaanii|पुरुकुत्सानी
पुरुकुत्सानी,<BR> ‘wife of Purukutsa,’ is mentioned as the mother of Trasadasyu in one hymn of the Rigveda (iv. 42, 9).

puruNiithashaatavaneya|पुरुणीथशातवनेय
पुरु-णीथ शात-वनेय<BR> (‘descendant of Śatavani’) is the name of a sacrificer, or perhaps a priest, a Bhāradvāja, in the Rigveda. 1) i. 59, 7. It is doubtful whether he is also mentioned as a singer in another passage of the Rigveda. 2) vii. 9. 6. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 60. In both places Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. sees in Puru-ṇītha merely a word meaning ‘choral song.’

purudama|पुरुदम
पुरु-दम<BR> occurs in the plural in the Atharvaveda, 1) vii. 73, 1. where, according to Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, xxv. it is probably the proper name of the singers, but by Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. and Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 437. is understood as merely an adjective meaning ‘possessed of many houses’ 

purupanthaa|पुरुपन्था
पुरु-पन्था<BR> is mentioned as a generous donor to a Bharadvāja in one hymn of the Rigveda (vi. 63, 10).

purumaayya|पुरुमाय्य
पुरु-माय्य<BR> occurs in one hymn of the Rigveda 1) viii. 68, 10. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. as a protégé of Indra. It is quite possible that he was the father of, or at least connected with, Atithigva, Ṛkṣa, and Aśvamedha, who are celebrated in the hymn.

purumitra|पुरुमित्र
पुरु-मित्र<BR> is mentioned twice in the Rigveda (i. 117, 20; x. 39, 7) as the father of a maiden who wedded Vimada, apparently against her father's will.

purumiiळ्ha|पुरुमीळ्ह
पुरु-मीऌह<BR> is mentioned twice in the Rigveda 1) i. 151, 2; 183. 5. as an ancient sage, in which capacity he appears in the Atharvaveda 2) iv. 29, 4; xviii. 3, 15. also. Perhaps the same 3) See, however, Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 27, n. 3; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 62, n. 3 Purumīḷha is intended in an obscure hymn in the Rigveda, 4) v. 61, 9. where, according to the legends reported in the Bṛhaddevatā 5) v. 49 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. and by Ṣaḍguruśiṣya in his commentary on the Sarvānukramaṇī, 6) Edition Macdonell, pp. 118 et seq. and by Sāyaṇa in his commentary on the Rigveda, 4) v. 61, 9. he as well as Taranta was a son of Vidadaśva, and a patron of the singer Śyāvāśva. The correctness of the legend has been shown to be most improbable by Oldenberg, 7) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 353, 354. Cf. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 359. who points out 8) Op. cit., 354, n. 1. that the legend misinterprets the Rigveda by making Purumīḷha a Vaidadaśvi, for he is there only compared in generosity to one. In another legend found in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 9) xiii. 7, 12. and based on a hymn of the Rigveda, 10) ix. 58, 3. Purumīḷha and Taranta appear as persons who received gifts from Dhvasra and Puruṣanti, and as sons of Vidadaśva. The legend, which also occurs in the Śāṭyāyanaka, 11) Cited by Sāyaṇa on Rv., loc. cit. is apparently best explained by Sieg, 12) Op, cit., 63. who says that as the two were kings they could not under the rules of caste accept gifts, unless for the nonce they became singers. The legend has no claim at all, as Oldenberg 13) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 232, n. 1. He points out, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 354, that the legend is not accepted by the Anukramaṇī (Index), since its list of authors gives Avatsāra as the Ṛṣi, not the two Taranta and Purumīḷha. shows, to validity. [Page 1-title-001+ 24]

puruSha|पुरुष
पुरुष,<BR> or Pūruṣa, is the generic term for ‘man’ in the Rigveda 1) vii. 104, 15; x. 97. 4. 5. 8; 165, 3. and later. 2) Av. iii. 21, 1; v. 21, 4; viii. 2, 25; 7, 2; xii. 3, 51; 4, 25; xiii. 4, 42, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 1, 5; 2, 2, 8; v. 2, 5, 1, etc. Man is composed of five parts according to the Atharvaveda, 3) xii. 3, 10; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 5, 26; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 14; vi. 29. or of six according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 4) ii. 39. or of sixteen, 5) Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 4, 16. or of twenty, 6) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxiii. 14, 5. or of twenty-one, 7) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 8, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 1, 6; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 18; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, i. 2, 4, etc. or of twenty-four, 8) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 2, 1, 23. or of twenty-five, 9) Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 12, 10; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, i. 1; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, i. 2, 4. all more or less fanciful enumerations. Man is the first of animals, 10) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 2, 1, 18; vii. 5, 2, 17. He is the master of animals, Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xx. 10. but also essentially an animal (see Paśu). The height of a man is given in the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra 11) xvi. 8, 21. 25. as four Aratnis (‘cubits’) , each of two Padas (‘feet’), each of twelve Aṅgulis (‘finger's breadths’); and the term Puruṣa itself is found earlier 12) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 5, 14; xiii. 8, 1, 19; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 5, 1. as a measure of length. Puruṣa is also applied to denote the length of a man's life, a ‘generation’; 13) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 5, 5; v. 4, 10, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 3, 6; dvi-puruṣa (‘two generations’), Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 7, etc. the ‘pupil’ in the eye; 14) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 5, 2. 7. 8; xii. 9, 1, 12; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 3, 9. and in the grammatical literature the ‘person’ of the verb. 15) Nirukta, vii. 1, 2. 

puruShamRga|पुरुषमृग
पुरुष मृग<BR> the ‘man wild beast,’ occurs in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 15, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 16; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 35. Zimmer's 2) Altindisches Leben, 85. view that the ape is meant seems probable. According to him also, the word Puruṣa alone, in two passages of the Atharvaveda, 3) vi. 38, 4; xix. 39, 4. refers to the ape and its cry (māyu); but this sense is not necessary, and it is not adopted by Bloomfield, 4) Hymns of the Atharvaveda. 117. though Whitney 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 309. does not think the rendering ‘cry of a man’ satisfactory, the term māyu not being properly applicable to the noise made by human beings.

puruShahastin|पुरुषहस्तिन्
पुरुष हस्तिन्<BR> (‘the man with a hand’) is found in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 29; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 8. It must be the ‘ape.’

puruShanti|पुरुषन्ति
पुरुषन्ति<BR> is a name that occurs twice in the Rigveda, 1) i. 112, 23; ix. 58, 3. in the first passage denoting a protégé of the Aśvins, in the second a patron who gave presents to one of the Vedic singers. In both cases the name is joined with that of Dhvasanti or Dhvasra. The presumption from the manner in which these three names are mentioned is that they designate men, but the grammatical form of the words might equally well be feminine. Females must be meant, if the evidence of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 2) xiii. 7, 12. Roth thinks the feminine form Dhvasre here is a corruption, based on the dual form occurring in the Rigveda, Dhvasrayoḥ, which might be feminine as well as masculine. is to be taken as decisive, for the form of the first of the two names there occurring, Dhvasre Puruṣantī, ‘Dhvasrā and Puruṣanti,’ is exclusively feminine, though here as well as elsewhere Sāyaṇa 3) Also on the Śāṭyāyanaka, cited on Rv. ix. 58, 3, and on Rv. i. 112, 23. Cf. Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 27, n. 1; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 62, 63; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 232, n. 1. interprets the names as masculines. See also Taranta and Purumīḷha. 

puruhanman|पुरुहन्मन्
पुरु-हन्मन्<BR> is the name of a Ṛṣi in a hymn of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 70, an Āṅgirasa, according to the Rigvedic Anukramaṇī (Index), but according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 2) xiv. 9, 29. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 107. a Vaikhānasa.

puruuravas|पुरूरवस्
पुरू-रवस्<BR> is the name of a hero in a hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 95. containing a curious dialogue between him and a nymph, Urvaśī, an Apsaras. He is also mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 2) xi. 5, 1, 1. Cf. iii. 4, 1, 22; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, viii. 10; Nirukta, x. 46. where several verses of the Rigvedic dialogue find a setting in a continuous story. In the later literature he is recognized as a king. 3) See Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 283 et seq. His name is perhaps intended in one other passage of the Rigveda. 4) i. 31, 4. It is impossible to say whether he is a mythical figure pure and simple, or really an ancient king. His epithet, Aiḷa, 5) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 1, 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 196; Max Müller, Chips, 42, 109 et seq.; Kuhn, Die Herabkunft des Feuers, 85 et seq.; Roth, Nirukta, Erläuterungen, 153; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 124, 135; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 28, 323. ‘descendant of Iḍā’ (a sacrificial goddess), is certainly in favour of the former alternative.

puruuru|पुरूरु
पुरूरु<BR> is the name of a poet, an Ātreya, in the Rigveda, 1) v. 70, 1. according to Ludwig. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 126. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 215, n. 1; Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 360. But the only form of the word found, purūruṇā, seems merely an adverb meaning ‘far and wide.’

puruuvasu|पुरूवसु
पुरू-वसु<BR> (‘abounding in wealth’) is the name of a poet, an Ātreya, according to Ludwig, 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 126. in one passage of the Rigveda. 2) v. 36, 3. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 215, n. 1; Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 333. But this is very doubtful. 

puroDaash|पुरोडाश्
पुरो-डाश्<BR> is the name of the sacrificial cake in the Rigveda 1) iii. 28, 2; 41, 3; 52, 2; iv. 24, 5; vi. 23, 7; viii. 31, 2, etc. and later. 2) Av. ix. 6, 12; x. 9, 25; xii. 4, 35; xviii. 4, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 2, 8; vii. 1, 9, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 85; xxviii. 23, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 270.

purodhaa|पुरोधा
पुरो-धा<BR> denotes the office of Purohita, ‘domestic priest.’ Its mention as early as the Atharvaveda, 1) v. 24, 1. and often later, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 2, 9; vii. 4, 1, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 1, 2; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 12; 9, 27; xv. 4, 7; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 31; viii. 24, 27; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 4, 5. shows that the post was a fully recognized and usual one.

puronuvaakyaa|पुरोनुवाक्या
पुरो-ऽनुवाक्या<BR> (‘introductory verse to be recited’) is the technical term for the address to a god inviting him to partake of the offering; it was followed by the Yājyā, which accompanied the actual oblation. 1) Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 387, 388. Such addresses are not unknown, but are rare, according to Oldenberg, 2) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 243 et seq., against Bergaigne, Recherches surl'llistoire de la liturgie védique, 13 et seq. in the Rigveda; subsequently they are regular, the word itself occurring in the later Saṃhitās 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 10, 4; ii. 2, 9, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xx. 12, etc. and the Brāhmaṇas. 4) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 17; ii. 13, 26; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 1, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 2, 21, etc.

puroruch|पुरोरुच्
पुरो-रुच्<BR> is the technical description of certain Nivid verses which were recited at the morning libation in the Ājya and Praüga ceremonies before the hymn (sūkta) of the litany or its parts. It occurs in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 10, 13; vii. 2, 7, 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 39; iii. 9; iv. 5; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1, 4, 5; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 3, 15; 2, 1, 8; v. 4, 4, 20, etc. Cf. Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 102. 

purovaata|पुरोवात
पुरो-वात,<BR> the ‘east wind,’ is mentioned in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 11, 3; ii. 4, 7, 1; iv. 3, 3, 1; 4, 6, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 5; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 2, 18; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, ii. 3, 1, etc. Geldner 2) Vedische Studien, 3, 120, n. 2. thinks it merely means the wind preceding the rains.

purohita|पुरोहित
पुरो-हित<BR> (‘placed in front,’ ‘appointed’) is the name of a priest in the Rigveda 1) i. 1, 1; 44, 10. 12; ii. 24, 9; iii. 2, 8; 3, 2; v. 11, 2; vi. 70, 4, etc. and later. 2) Av. viii. 5, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ix. 23; xi. 81; xxxi. 20; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 24, etc.; Nirukta, ii. 12; vii. 15. The office of Purohita is called Purohiti 3) Rv. vii. 60, 12; 83, 4. and Purodhā. It is clear that the primary function of the Purohita was that of ‘domestic priest’ of a king, or perhaps a great noble; his quite exceptional position is shown by the fact that only one Purohita seems ever to be mentioned in Vedic literature. 4) Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 144, thinks that several Purohitas were possible, quoting Sāyaṇa, on Rv. x. 57, 1, who gives the tale of the Gaupāyanas and King Asamāti from the Śāṭyāyanaka, and comparing the case of Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra as Purohitas, probably contemporaneously, of Sudās. But that the two were contemporaneous is most unlikely, especially if we adopt the very probable view of Hopkins (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 260 et seq.) that Viśvāmitra was with the ten kings (Rv. vii. 18) when they unsuccessfully attacked Sudās. The other narrative has, as Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 375, n. 3, observes, a markedly fictitious character; while every other passage that mentions a Purohita speaks of him in the singular, and as there was only one Brahman priest at the sacrifice, so the Purohita acted as Brahman. Examples of Purohitas in the Rigveda are Viśvāmitra 5) iii. 33. 53. Cf. vii. 18. or Vasiṣṭha 6) Rv. vii. 18. 83. in the service of the Bharata king; Sudās, of the Tṛtsu family; the Purohita of Kuruśravaṇa; 7) Rv. x. 33. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 150, 184. and Devāpi, the Purohita of Śantanu. 8) Rv. x. 98. The Purohita was in all religious matters the alter ego of the king. In the ritual 9) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 24. it is laid down that a king must have a Purohita, else the gods will not accept his offerings. He ensures the king's safety and victory in battle by his prayers; 10) See Av. iii. 19; Rv. vii. 18, 13, from which Geldner, op. cit., 2, 135, n. 3, concludes that the priest prayed in the Sabhā, ‘house of assembly,’ while the king fought on the field of battle. See Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 12. 19. 20. Cf. Pūru, n. 2. he procures the fall of rain for the crops; 11) Rv. x. 98. he is the flaming fire that guards the kingdom. 12) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 24. 25. Divodāsa in trouble is rescued by Bharadvāja; 13) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xv. 3, 7. and King Tryaruṇa Traidhātva Aikṣvāka reproaches his Purohita, Vṛśa Jāna, when his car runs over a Brahmin boy and kills him. 14) Ibid., xiii. 3, 12. See Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 64, et seq. The close relation of king and Purohita is illustrated by the case of Kutsa Aurava, who slew his Purohita, Upagu Sauśravasa, for disloyalty in serving Indra, to whom Kutsa was hostile. 15) Ibid., xiv. 6, 8. Other disputes between kings and priests who officiated for them are those of Janamejaya and the Kaśyapas, and of Viśvantara and the Śyāparṇas; 16) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 27. 35. and between Asamāti and the Gaupāyanas. 17) See Śāṭyāyanaka, cited by Sāyaṇa, on Rv. x. 57, 1; and cf. Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 167 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 41). In some cases one Purohita served more than one king; for example, Devabhāga Śrautarṣa was the Purohita of the Kurus and the Sṛṅjayas at the same time, 18) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 4, 5. According to Sāyaṇa, on Rv. i. 81, 3. is was Rāhūgaṇa Gotama who was Purohita; but this is hardly more than a mere blunder. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 152; Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 9, n. and Jala Jātūkarṇya was the Purohita of the kings of Kāśi, Videha, and Kosala. 19) Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 29, 5. There is no certain proof that the office of Purohita was hereditary in a family, though it probably was so. 20) See Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 375, who compares the permanent character of the relation of the king and the Purohita with that of husband and wife, as shown in the ritual laid down in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 27. At any rate, it seems clear from the relations of the Purohita with King Kuruśravaṇa, and with his son Upamaśravas, 21) See Rv. x. 33, and n. 7. that a king would keep on the Purohita of his father. Zimmer 22) Altindisches Leben, 195, 196. thinks that the king might act as his own Purohita, as shown by the case of King Viśvantara, who sacrificed without the help of the Śyāparṇas, 23) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 27; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 436-440. and that a Purohita need not be a priest, as shown by the case of Devāpi and Śantanu. 24) Rv. x. 98. But neither opinion seems to be justified. It is not said that Viśvantara sacrificed without priests, while Devāpi is not regarded as a king until the Nirukta, 25) ii. 10. and there is no reason to suppose that Yāska's view expressed in that work is correct. According to Geldner, 26) Op. cit., 2, 144; 3, 155. Cf. Pischel, Göttingisehe Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1894, 420; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 13. Rv. i. 94, 6, does not prove that the Purohita was a Ṛtvij: it merely shows that he could be one when he wished. the Purohita from the beginning acted as the Brahman priest in the sacrificial ritual, being there the general superintendent of the sacrifice. In favour of this view, he cites the fact that Vasiṣṭha is mentioned both as Purohita 27) Rv. x. 150, 5. and as Brahman: 28) Rv. vii. 33, 11. But this need mean no more than Brahmin. at the sacrifice of Śunaḥśepa he served as Brahman, 29) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 16, 1; Sāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xv. 21, 4. but he was the Purohita of Sudās; 30) Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 11 14. Bṛhaspati is called the Purohita 31) Rv. ii. 24, 9; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 17, 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 1, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 1, 2; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiv. 23, 1 and the Brahman 32) Rv. x. 141, 3; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, vi. 13; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 4, 21; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 6, 9. of the gods; and the Vasiṣṭhas who are Purohitas are also the Brahmans at the sacrifice. 33) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 5, 2, 1. This point is not in the parallel versions, Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 17 (but cf. xxvii. 4: brahma-purohitaṃ kṣatram, unless this means ‘the Kṣatra is inferior to the Brahma’); Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xv. 5, 24, and cf. Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 13. The Atharvan literature (Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, lx, lxi) requires a follower of that Veda to act as Brahman, and the spells of the Atharvan are, in fact, closely allied to the spells of the Purohita as represented in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 24-28. Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 193, 195. It is thus clear that the Brahman was often the Purohita; and it was natural that this should be the case when once the Brahman's place became, as it did in the later ritual, the most important position at the sacrifice. 34) See Bloomfield, op. cit., lviii, lxii, lxv, lxviii et seq. But the Brahman can hardly be said to have held this place in the earlier ritual; Oldenberg 35) Religion des Veda, 380, 381. seems to be right in holding that the Purohita was originally the Hotṛ priest, the singer par excellence, when he took any part at all in the ritual of the great sacrifices with the Ṛtvijs. So Devāpi seems clearly to have been a Hotṛ; 36) Rv. x. 98; and cf. Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 6, 8; Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 12, 7. Agni is at once Purohita 37) Rv. i. 1, 1; iii. 3, 2; 11, 1; v. 11, 2. In viii. 27, 1; x. 1, 6, he is called Purohita, and credited with the characteristic activities of the Hotṛ priest. and Hotṛ; 38) Rv. i. 1, 1; iii. 3, 2; 11, 1; v. 11, 2. etc. and the ‘two divine Hotṛs’ referred to in the Āprī litanies are also called the ‘two Purohitas.’ 39) Rv. x. 66, 13; 70, 7. Later, no doubt, when the priestly activity ceased to centre in the song, the Purohita, with his skill in magic, became the Brahman, who also required magic to undo the errors of the sacrifice. 40) Cf. Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 26. There is little doubt that in the original growth of the priesthood the Purohita played a considerable part. In historical times he represented the real power of the kingship, and may safely be deemed to have exercised great influence in all public affairs, such as the administration of justice and the king's conduct of business. But it is not at all probable that the Purohita represents, as Roth 41) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 117 et seq. and Zimmer 42) Altindisches Leben, 195. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 168, 169; 195 et seq.; Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 485; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 31-35; 138; Haug, Brahma und die Brahmanen, 9 et seq.; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 144; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 374-383; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, lxx et seq. thought, the source which gave rise to caste. The priestly class is already in existence in the Rigveda (see Varṇa).

pulasti|पुलस्ति
पुलस्ति<BR> 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 9, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 43. or Pulastin 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhītā, xvii. 15. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 265. in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās denotes ‘wearing the hair plain,’ as opposed to kapardin, ‘wearing the hair in braids.’

pulinda|पुलिन्द
पुलिन्द<BR> is the name of an outcast tribe mentioned with the Andhras in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 1) vii. 18. but not in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 2) xv. 26. in connexion with the story of Śunaḥśepa. The Pulindas again appear associated with the Andhras in the time of Aśoka. 3) Vincent Smith, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 56, 652. 

puliikaya|पुलीकय
पुलीकय<BR> See Purīkaya.

puliikaa|पुलीका
पुलीका<BR> seems to designate some kind of bird in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (iii. 14, 5). The name appears in the form of Kulīkā in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (xxiv. 24).

puluShapraachiinayogya|पुलुषप्राचीनयोग्य
पुलुष प्राचीन-योग्य<BR> (‘descendant of Prācīnayoga’) is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Dṛti Aindroti Śaunaka, in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 40, 2). He taught Pauluṣi Satyayajña.

puShkara|पुष्कर
पुष्कर<BR> is the name in the Rigveda 1) vi. 16, 13; vii. 33, 11, may be so taken, though Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3, and Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 112, prefer to see in these passages a reference to the bowl of the sacrificial ladle. and later 2) Av. xi. 3, 8; xii. 1, 24; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 4, 1; 2, 6, 5; 6, 4, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 29; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 1, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5, 1, 16; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 5. of the blue lotus flower. The Atharvaveda 3) Av. xii. 1, 24. mentions its sweet perfume. The lotus grew in lakes, which were thence called puṣkariṇī, ‘lotus-bearing.’ 4) Rv. v. 78, 7; x. 107, 10; Av. iv. 34, 5; v. 16, 17; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 3, 11, etc. That the flower was early used for personal adornment is shown by an epithet of the Aśvins, ‘lotuscrowned’ (puṣkara-sraj). 5) Rv. x. 184, 2; Av. iii. 22, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 5, 16, etc. Presumably because of its likeness in shape to the flower of the lotus, the bowl of the ladle is called Puṣkara, perhaps already in the Rigveda, 6) Rv. viii 72, 11, where the sense is doubtful, and the bowl of the ladle is not particularly appropriate. See also note 1. and certainly in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 7) vii. 5. Moreover, according to the Nirukta, 8) v. 14. Puṣkara means ‘water,’ a sense actually found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 9) vi. 4, 2, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71.

puShkarasaada|पुष्करसाद
पुष्कर-साद,<BR> ‘sitting on the lotus,’ is the name of an animal in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 14, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 12; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 5. It can hardly be a ‘snake,’ 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95, so takes it. but rather either, as Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. thinks, a ‘bird,’ or perhaps, according to the commentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 14, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 12; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 5. a ‘bee.’

puShTigu|पुष्टिगु
पुष्टि-गु<BR> is the name of a Ṛṣi mentioned in a Vālakhilya hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 51, 1. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 140, 141.

puShpa|पुष्प
पुष्प<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 7, 12. Cf. x. 8, 34. and later 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 28; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, viii. 4, 1; xv. 3, 23; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 4, 4, 2; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iii. 1, 2; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 1, etc. denotes a ‘flower’ generally.

puShya|पुष्य
पुष्य<BR> is the name in the Atharvaveda (xix. 7, 2 for the Nakṣatra called Tiṣya elsewhere. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 371. On Tiṣya, see also Journal of the Royal Asatic Society, 1911, 514-518; 794-800.

puutakrataa|पूतक्रता
पूत-क्रता<BR> is the name of a woman in a Vālakhilya hymn of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 64, 4. perhaps the wife of Pūtakratu, but this is doubtful, since the more regular form would be Pūtakratāyī, 2) Pāṇini, iv. 1, 36. which Scheftelowitz 3) Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 41, 42. reads in the hymn.

puutakratu|पूतक्रतु
पूत-क्रतु<BR> (‘of clear insight’) is the name of a patron in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 68, 17. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 41, reads Pūtakratu for Pautakrata in Rv. viii. 56, 2, but this is improbable. See Oldenberg, Göttingische Gelekrte Anzeigen, 1907, 237, 238; Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 39, n. 4. apparently the son of Aśvamedha. 

puutirajju|पूतिरज्जु
पूति-रज्जु<BR> is the name of a certain plant of unknown kind in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 8, 2. according to Roth. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. The Kauśika Sūtra 3) xvi. 10. treats it as a ‘putrid rope,’ but Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 527. Cf. Whitney's Translation of the Rigveda, 503; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 583. suggests that a snake is meant.

puutiika|पूतीक
पूतीक<BR> is the name of a plant often mentioned 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 3 (pūtika,  as quoted in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1, 2, 12. Cf. iv. 5, 10, 4; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, viii. 4, 1; ix. 5, 3, etc. as a substitute for the Soma plant. It is also given in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 2) ii. 5, 3, 5. as a means of making milk curdle, being an alternative to the bark of the Butea frondosa (parṇa-valka). It is usually identified with the Guilandina Bonduc, but Hillebrandt 3) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 24, n. 3. Cf. Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 35, 689; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 63, 276. makes it out to be the Basella Cordifolia.

puutudru|पूतुद्रु
पूतु-द्रु<BR> is another name for the Deodar (deva-dāru) in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 2, 28. and the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 8, 4 (in 6 the fruit is meant); Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 8, 5. The longer form, Pūtu-dāru, is found in the Kauśika Sūtra. 3) viii. 15; lviii. 15. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 59.

puuru|पूरु
पूरु<BR> is the name of a people and their king in the Rigveda. They are mentioned with the Anus, Druhyus, Turvaśas, and Yadus in one passage. 1) i. 108. 8. They also occur as enemies of the Tṛtsus in the hymn of Sudās’ victory. 2) vii. 18, 13. Cf. Turvaśa. Apparently, as Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 263, n., and Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 135, think, in this verse the words jeṣma Pūruṃ vidathe mṛdhravācam refer to the Pūru king and to the priest Viśvāmitra, who prayed for the defeat of Sudās, though in vain. Hopkins seems to take the words vidathe mṛdhravācam generally as ‘the false speaker in the assembly’; but, according to Geldner, the meaning intended is that, while the king fought, the Purohita prayed in the Sabhā, or meeting house of the people. In another hymn 3) Rv. vii. 8, 4. Agni of the Bharatas is celebrated as victorious over the Pūrus, probably a reference to the same decisive overthrow. On the other hand, victories of the Pūrus over the aborigines seem to be referred to in several passages. 4) i. 59, 6; 131, 4; 174, 2; iv. 21, 10; 38, 1; vi. 20, 10; vii. 5, 3; 19, 3. Cf. note 13. The great kings of the Pūrus were Purukutsa and his son Trasadasyu, whose name bears testimony to his prowess against aboriginal foes, while a later prince was Tṛkṣi Trāsadasyava. In the Rigveda the Pūrus are expressly 5) vii. 96, 2. Perhaps they are also meant as living on the Śaryaṇāvant in Rv. viii. 64, 10. 11. mentioned as on the Sarasvatī. Zimmer 6) Altindisches Leben, 124. thinks that the Sindhu (Indus) is meant in this passage. But Ludwig 7) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 175. and Hillebrandt 8) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 50, 115; 3, 374. with much greater probability think that the eastern Sarasvatī in Kurukṣetra is meant. This view accords well with the sudden disappearance of the name of the Pūrus from Vedic tradition, a disappearance accounted for by Oldenberg's 9) Buddha, 404. Cf. Ludwig, 3, 205. conjecture that the Pūrus became part of the great Kuru people, just as Turvaśa and Krivi disappear from the tradition on their being merged in the Pañcāla nation. Trāsadasyava, the patronymic of Kuruśravaṇa in the Rigveda, 10) x. 33, 4. shows that the royal families of the Kurus and the Pūrus were allied by intermarriage. Hillebrandt, 11) Op. cit., 1, 114 et seq. admitting that the Pūrus in later times lived in the eastern country round the Sarasvatī, thinks that in earlier days they were to be found to the west of the Indus with Divodāsa. This theory must fall with the theory that Divodāsa was in the far west. It might, however, be held to be supported by the fact that Alexander found a --that is, a Paurava prince on the Hydaspes, 12) Arrian, Indica, viii. 4; ix. 1; xix. 3, etc. See Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 132, 133. a sort of half-way locality between the Sarasvatī and the West. But it is quite simple to suppose either that the Hydaspes was the earlier home of the Pūrus, where some remained after the others had wandered east, or that the later Paurava represents a successful onslaught upon the west from the east. In several other passages of the Rigveda 13) In Rv. i. 36, 1, Pūrūṇām might be read for purūṇām, with improvement in the sense. In i. 63, 7, there is a reference to the Pūru king, Purukutsa, and Sudās, but in what relation is uncertain (see Purukutsa). In i. 130, 7. the Pūru king and Divodāsa Atithigva are both mentioned, apparently as victorious over aboriginal foes. See also i. 129, 5; iv. 39, 2; v. 17, 1; vi. 46, 8; x. 4, 1; 48, 5. the Pūrus as a people seem to be meant. The Nirukta 14) vii. 23; Naighaṇṭuka, ii. 3. recognizes the general sense of ‘man,’ but in no passage is this really necessary or even probable. So utterly, however, is the tradition lost that the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 15) vi. 8, 1, 14. explains Pūru in the Rigveda 16) vii. 8, 4. as an Asura Rakṣas; it is only in the Epic that Pūru revives as the name of a son of Yayāti and Śarmiṣṭhā. 17) Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 26, etc. Cf. Hillebrandt, op. cit., 1, 110 et seq.; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 398.

puuruSha|पूरुष
पूरुष<BR> has in several passages 1) Rv. vi. 39, 5 (cf., however, Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 43); x. 97, 4; Av. iv. 9, 7; x. 1, 17; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 3, 1, 22, etc. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 383. the sense of ‘menial’ or ‘dependent,’ like the English ‘man.’

puurNamaasa|पूर्णमास
पूर्ण-मास<BR> denotes the full moon and the festival of that day, occurring frequently in the later Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 7, 2; ii. 2, 10, 2; 5, 4, 1; iii. 4, 4, 1; vii. 4, 8, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 1, 14; iii. 5, 7, 13; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 2, 4, 8, etc. Cf. Māsa.

puurta|पूर्त
पूर्त,<BR> 1) Rv. vi. 16, 18; viii. 46, 21; Av. vi. 123, 5; ix. 5, 13; 6, 31; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 64; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 21, 24, etc. or Pūrti, 2) Rv. vi. 13, 6; x. 107, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 2, 3, 2; ii. 4, 7, 1, etc. occurs in the Rigveda and later denoting the reward to the priest for his services. Cf. Dakṣiṇā.

puurpati|पूर्पति
पूर्-पति,<BR> ‘lord of the fort,’ occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) i. 173. 10. is of somewhat doubtful interpretation. The term may denote a regular office, 2) Cf. Sāyaṇa's note, on Rv. i. 173, 10; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 456. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 204. similar to that of the Grāmaṇī: the Pur would then be a permanently occupied settlement. The expression may, however, merely mean the chief over a fort when it was actually occupied against hostile attack. The rarity of the word seems to favour the latter sense.

puurvapaxa|पूर्वपक्ष
पूर्व-पक्ष<BR> denotes the first half of the month. See Māsa.

puurvavayasa|पूर्ववयस
पूर्व-वयस,<BR> the ‘first period of life,’ is a term used in the Brāhmaṇas 1) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xix. 4, 3; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 2, 3, 4; 9, 1, 8; pūrva-vayasin, Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 13, 3. Cf. Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v. 3, 3, where vatsa and tṛtīya, ‘the third (stage),’ are used to cover ‘youth’ and ‘old age,’ as opposed to manhood, when the knowledge of the doctrines of the Āraṇyaka is to be imparted. to denote ‘youth.’

puurvavah|पूर्ववह्
पूर्व-वह्<BR> is a term applied to the horse (Aśva) in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 1) i. 1, 5, 6 and elsewhere. 2) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 4, 17; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiii. 3. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. It may either refer to a horse fastened in front as a ‘leader,’ or merely mean ‘drawing (a chariot) for the first time,’ as understood by the commentator on the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.

puurvaahNa|पूर्वाह्ण
पूर्वाह्ण,<BR> ‘the earlier (part of the) day,’ ‘forenoon,’ is a common designation of time from the Rigveda 1) x. 34, 11. onwards. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 20; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 12; iii. 4. 4, 2; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 11, 7; Nirukta, viii. 9, etc. Cf. Ahan.

puulya|पूल्य
पूल्य,<BR> or Pūlpa, in the Atharvaveda 1) xiv. 2, 63. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 765. seems to mean ‘shrivelled grain’ (cf. Lājā). 

pRxa|पृक्ष
पृक्ष<BR> (literally, perhaps ‘swift’) is the proper name of a man in an obscure verse of the Rigveda. 1) ii. 13, 8. Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 97.

pRxayaama|पृक्षयाम
पृक्ष-याम<BR> occurs once in the plural in the Rigveda. 1) i. 122, 7. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. suggests the sense of ‘faring with swift steeds,’ and thinks a proper name is meant. Pischel 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 97, 98. holds that the word is an epithet of the Pajras, and that it means ‘performing splendid sacrifices.’

pRDa|पृड
पृड<BR> See Mṛḍa.

pRt|पृत्
पृत्<BR> 1) Only in the locative, Rv. ii. 27, 15; 26, 1; iii. 49, 3; vi. 20, 1, etc.; pṛtsuṣn, i. 129, 4 (with double case-ending). and Pṛtanā 2) Rv. i. 85, 8; 91, 21; 119, 10; 152. 7; ii. 40, 5; iii. 24, 1; vi. 41, 5; x. 29, 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 76; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xv. 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 1, 6; 2, 6, etc. denote, in the Rigveda and later, ‘contest,’ whether in arms or in the chariot race. Pṛtanā has also the concrete sense of ‘army’ in some passages; 3) Rv. vii. 20, 3; viii. 36, 1; 37, 2; Av. vi. 97, 1; viii. 5, 8; Nirukta, ix. 24; perhaps also as neuter in Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 7, 5. in the Epic system 4) Mahābhārata, i. 291. it denotes a definite body of men, elephants, chariots, and horses. Pṛtanājya 5) Rv. iii. 8, 10; 37, 7; vii. 99, 4; viii. 12, 25; ix. 102, 9; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 4, 1. has only the sense of ‘combat.’

pRtha|पृथ
पृथ,<BR> the ‘palm’ of the hand in the sense of its breath, is used as a measure of length in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇā. 1) i. 6, 4, 2, 3; cf. Kātyāyana Śrauṭa Sūtra, vi. 1, 28; Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, ii. 2, 7; viii. 5, 10.

pRthavaana|पृथवान
पृथवान<BR> is in the Rigveda 1) x. 93, 14. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 433. the name of a man, perhaps also called Duḥśīma, but this is uncertain. Cf. Pṛthi. 

pRthi|पृथि
पृथि,<BR> 1) Rv. i. 112, 15, as a seer; as Vainya, Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 7, 4, and perhaps ii. 7, 5, 1 (Pṛthaye). Pṛthī, 2) As Vainya, Rv. viii. 9, 10; Av. viii. 10, 24; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 19; as Pṛthi or Pṛthī, Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 5, 1; as Vainya, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 5, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 4 (Indische Studien, 3, 463). Venya mentioned with Pṛthī in Rv. x. 148, 5, may be meant for his patronymic (= Vainya): cf. Tugrya, n. 1. or Pṛthu 3) Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 186 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 125); Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 10, 9; 34, 6; 45, 1. is the name of a semi-mythical personage who is mentioned in the Rigveda and later as a Ṛṣi, and more specially as the inventor of agriculture 4) Av., loc. cit. and the lord of both worlds, of men and of animals. 5) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. Cf. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 5, 1. He bears in several passages 6) See notes 1-3. the epithet Vainya, ‘descendant of Vena,’ and must probably be regarded as a culture hero rather than as a real man. According to other accounts, 7) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit.; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, loc. cit.; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 7, 4. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 221, 222; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 50, n. 2; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 134. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 81, gives the name as Pṛthin Vainya; but the oblique cases, when found, are all in favour of Pṛthi or Pṛthī as the stem. he was the first of consecrated kings. Cf. Pārthiva.

pRthivii|पृथिवी
पृथिवी<BR> denotes the ‘earth’ as the ‘broad’ one in the Rigveda 1) Rv. vii. 7, 2, 5; 99, 3; v. 85, 1, 5; viii. 89, 5, etc. and later, 2) Av. xii. 1, 1 et seq.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 53, etc. being often personified as a deity 3) Rv. iv. 3, 5; 51, 11; v. 49, 5; 84, 1 et seq.; vi. 50, 13, 14; vii. 34, 23, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xii. 103, etc. both alone and with Div, ‘heaven,’ as Dyāvā-Pṛthivī. 4) Rv. iv. 56, 1; vii. 53, 1, etc. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 20, 21, 123, 126. Mention is often made of three earths, 5) Rv. i. 34, 8; iv. 53, 5; vii. 104, 11; Av. iv. 20, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, v. 9, etc. of which the world on which we live is the highest. 6) Av. vi. 21, 1; xix. 27, 3; 32, 4; 53, 5; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 1, 31; v. 1, 5, 21. The earth is girdled by the ocean, according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 7) viii. 20. This idea is not found in the Saṃhitās, Macdonell, op. cit., p. 9. The Nirukta 8) ix. 31; xi. 36; xii. 30; Naighaṇṭuka, v. 3, 5, 6. Cf. Bruce, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 19, 321 et seq. places one of the three earths in each of the worlds into which the universe is divided (see Div). In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 9) xiv. 1, 2, 10. the earth is called the ‘firstborn of being,’ and its riches (vitta) are referred to; 10) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 6, 3. hence in a late passage of the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 11) xiii. 1. the earth is styled vasu-matī, ‘full of wealth.’ The word also occurs in the Rigveda, 12) vi. 12, 5; x. 187, 2. Cf. Macdonell, op. cit., 34. though rarely, in the form of Pṛthvī. 13) The regular adjectival feminine form of pṛthu, ‘broad.’

pRthu|पृथु
पृथु<BR> See Pṛthi. Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 196 et seq. also finds a mention of the Pṛthus as a tribe, allied with the Parśus, in one passage of the Rigveda 2) vii. 83, 1. as opponents of the Tṛtsu Bharatas. But this interpretation is certainly incorrect. 3) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 134 et seq.; 433, 434; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 184, n. 3; Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 2, 362, n. See Parśu.

pRthushravas|पृथुश्रवस्
1. Pṛthu-śravas (‘far-famed’) is mentioned in connexion with Vaśa in two hymns 1) i. 116, 21; viii. 46, 21. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 162. of the Rigveda. In the second passage the generosity of Pṛthuśravas Kānīta to Vaśa Aśvya is celebrated, and the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 2) xvi. 11, 13. refers to the episode.

pRthushravasdaureshravasa|पृथुश्रवस्दौरेश्रवस
2. Pṛthu-śravas Daure-śravasa (‘descendant of Dūreśravas’) is the name of the Udgātṛ priest at the snake festival mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

pRdaaku|पृदाकु
पृदाकु,<BR> the name of a ‘snake’ in the Atharvaveda, 1) i. 27, 1; iii. 27, 3; vi. 38, 1; vii. 56, 1; x. 4, 11 et seq.; xii. 3, 57. is mentioned in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’), in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 10, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 14; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 33. and occasionally else where. 3) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vi. 12; Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 27. Its skin was specially valuable, according to the Atharvaveda. 4) i. 27. 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94.

pRdaakusaanu|पृदाकुसानु
पृदाकु-सानु,<BR> ‘having the surface of a snake,’ is taken by Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 161. and Griffith 2) Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 141. as the name of the institutor of a sacrifice in one hymn of the Rigveda. 3) viii. 17, 15.

pRshana|पृशन
पृशन<BR> in one passage of the Rigveda 1) ix. 97, 54. is considered by Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 16. to denote a place where a battle was fought.

pRshnigu|पृश्निगु
1. Pṛśni-gu is the name of a man who is mentioned with Purukutsa and Śucanti as a protégé of the Aśvins in one hymn of the Rigveda (i. 112, 7). Possibly the word is only an epithet of Purukutsa. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 114.

pRshnigu|पृश्निगु
2. Pṛśni-gu, pl., is taken in one passage of the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 10. by Geldner 2) Rigveda, Glossar, 114. as denoting the name of a people. But this is not probable.

pRshniparNii|पृश्निपर्णी
पृश्नि-पर्णी<BR> (‘having a speckled leaf’) is the name of a plant mentioned in a hymn of the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 25, 1 et seq. as a protection against evil beings procuring abortion, called Kaṇvas (presumably a sign of hostility to the Kaṇva family). 2) Cf. Lanman in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 65; Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 2, 465; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 207. It also appears in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 3) xiii. 8, 1, 10. being identified with Hermionitis cordifolia by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, but Roth 4) Cited by Whitney, loc. cit. in a subsequent contribution suggests that it is the same as a plant later called lakṣmaṇā, and regarded as curing barrenness. The scholiast on the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra 5) xxv. 7, 17. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 187; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 69; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 302. thinks that the Glycine debilis is meant.

pRShata|पृषत
पृषत<BR> is the name of an animal mentioned in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 17, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 9. 21; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 27. 40. The dappled antelope or gazelle seems to be meant. 2) Nirukta, ii. 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83.

pRShatii|पृषती
पृषती<BR> in some passages 1) Rv. viii. 64, 10. 11, where ‘deer’ is nonsense, and ‘mares’ is improbable. The regular donation is ‘cows’; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 2, 9 (see Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 125); Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 2 (though this is not certain); Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 14, 23, etc. clearly means a ‘speckled’ cow. The term is, however, generally 2) Rv. i. 37, 2; 39, 6; 64, 8; 85, 4, 5; ii. 34, 3; 36, 2; iii. 26, 4; v. 55, 6; 58, 6; 60, 2; i. 162, 21. applied to the team of the Maruts, when its sense is doubtful. The commentators usually explain it as ‘speckled antelope.’ But Mahīdhara, 3) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ii. 16. followed by Roth, 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. He had earlier (ibid., 1, 1091) been inclined to follow the usual interpretation given by Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 37, 2, etc., which Benfey, Orient und Occident, 2, 250, accepted. prefers to see in it a ‘dappled mare’: it is true that the Maruts are often called 5) Rv. i. 87, 4; 89, 7; 186, 8; ii. 34, 4; iii. 26, 6; v. 42, 15; vii. 40, 3 pṛṣad-aśva, which is more naturally interpreted as ‘having dappled steeds,’ than as ‘having Pṛṣatīs as steeds.’ 6) So Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 87, 4. This view is far-fetched, but is supported, in so far as the interpretation of Pṛṣatī and Aśva is concerned, by such passages as v. 55, 6, where the Maruts are said to yoke the Pṛṣatīs as aśvān to their chariots; but the sense may be ‘horses (and) dappled (mares).’ See, however, Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 226. In the later literature, which Grassmann 7) Wörterbuch, s.v. prefers to follow, the word means the female of the dappled gazelle. Aufrecht 8) See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 152. concurs in the view of Roth, but Max Müller 9) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 70; 184. is inclined to accept the traditional interpretation, while Muir 10) Op. cit., 5, 151, 152. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83. leaves the matter open.

pRShadaajya|पृषदाज्य
पृषद्-आज्य<BR> denotes ‘sprinkled butter’--that is, butter (Ājya) mixed with sour milk, in the Rigveda 1) x. 90, 8. and later. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 6, 2; vi. 3, 9, 6; 11, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 2, 41; 4, 2; iii. 8, 4, 8, etc. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 404, n. 1.

pRShadhra|पृषध्र
पृषध्र<BR> occurs in a Vālakhilya hymn of the Rigveda 1) viii. 52, 2. as the name of a man. He is also mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 2) xvi. 11, 25-27. as a patron of Praskaṇva, and called Pṛṣadhra Medhya Mātariśvan (or Mātariśva); but for once there is a discrepancy between the statement of the Sūtra and the text of the Rigveda, for the hymns 3) viii. 55. 56. there attributed to Praskaṇva as in praise of Pṛṣadhra have nothing in them connected with Pṛṣadhra, while the Anukramaṇī (Index) ascribes to Pṛṣadhra himself the authorship of one of them. 4) viii. 56. Cf. Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 39. On the other hand, Medhya and Mātariśvan appear as separate persons in the Rigveda 1) viii. 52, 2. along with Pṛṣadhra.

pRShaataka|पृषातक
पृषातक<BR> is the name of a mixture like Pṛṣadājya, and consisting, according to the late Gṛhyasaṃgraha, 1) ii. 59. of curds (Dadhi), honey (Madhu), and Ajya. It is mentioned in a late passage of the Atharvaveda 2) xx. 134, 2. and in the Sūtras. 3) Mānava Gṛhya Sūtra, ii. 3, etc. Cf. Bloomfield, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 35, 580.

pRShTyaa|पृष्ट्या
पृष्ट्या<BR> 1) So Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. Pṛṣṭhyā is read in the St. Petersburg Dictionary. See, however, Grill, Hundert Lieder,^2 169; Bloomfield; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 513. denotes in the Atharvaveda (vi. 102, 2) the side horse (mare). 

pRShTyaamaya|पृष्ट्यामय
पृष्ट्य्-आमय<BR> denotes in the Atharvaveda 1) xix. 34, 10. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 65, 391. a pain in the sides or ribs. 2) The derivative adjective Pṛṇṭyāmayin, ‘suffering from a pain in the side,’ occurs in Rv. i. 105, 18. It appears to be mentioned there merely as an accompaniment of fever (Takman).

petva|पेत्व
पेत्व<BR> is found twice in the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 4, 8; v. 19, 2. In the first passage reference is made to its vāja, which Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 229, 230. argues can only mean ‘strength,’ ‘swiftness,’ though naturally the sense of ‘male power’ would seem more appropriate in a spell intended to remove lack of virility. In the second passage the Petva is mentioned as overcoming the horse (see Ubhayādant), a miracle which has a parallel in the Rigveda, 3) vii. 18, 17. where the Petva overcomes the female 4) Siṃhyam in the text. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 264, takes it as masculine, and as a play on śiṃyum, the name of one of the kings or peoples defeated in the battle of the ten kings. But, admitting the play, siṃhī as fem. seems to be still more pointed than siṃha, contrasting with the masculine petva. lion. The animal also occurs in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 22; 1. Though not in the parallel passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, it appears to be found in the Kāṭhaka, according to Weber's note in his edition of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. and occasionally elsewhere. 6) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 8, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxix. 58. 59; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 5, 3. etc. It appears to be the ‘ram’ or the ‘wether,’ the latter 7) Galita-retasko meṣaḥ. being the sense given to it by the commentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. But there is no conclusive evidence in favour of this meaning, while on the whole the passage of the Atharvaveda, in which vāja is found, accords best with the sense of ‘ram.’ Hopkins, 8) Loc. cit.; India, Old and New, 58. He thinks the born of the goat pierced the lion. Curiously enough, Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 253. renders the word a ‘goat’ in Av. v. 19, 2, but (p. 151) as ‘ram’ in iv. 4, 8; and Bloomfield Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 434, speaks Both of a ‘ram’ and a ‘goat’ in connexion with v. 19, 2. however, renders the word as ‘goat,’ though for what reason is not clear. Whether it is connected in any way with Pitva or Pidva is quite uncertain. 

pedu|पेदु
पेदु<BR> is the name in the Rigveda 1) Rv. i. 117, 9; 118, 9; 119, 10; vii. 71, 5; x. 39, 10. of a protégé of the Aśvins, who gave him, in order, as it seems, to replace a bad steed, a mythical horse, hence called Paidva, 2) Rv. ix. 88, 4; Av. x. 4, 5 et seq. which probably represents the horse of the sun. 3) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 52, 149.

peruka|पेरुक
पेरुक<BR> occurs in an obscure verse of the Rigveda 1) vi. 63, 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158. as the name of a patron of the poet.

pesas|पेसस्
पेसस्<BR> denotes in the Rigveda 1) ii. 3, 6; iv. 36, 7; vii. 34, 11; 42, 1. and later 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 82. 89; xx. 40; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 19, etc. an embroidered garment such as a female dancer would wear. 3) Rv. i. 92, 4. 5. The fondness of the Indians for such raiment is noted by Megasthenes 4) See S¤trabo, p. 509, where he refers to a . and by Arrian, 5) Indica, 5, 9. who refer to their . So in one passage 6) Rv. x. 1, 6. a garment (vastra) is called peśana, with which Roth 7) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. happily compares the Roman vestis coloribus intexta. The making of such garments was a regular occupation of women, as is indicated by the Peśas-kārī, the ‘female embroiderer,’ figuring in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda, 8) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 9; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 5, 1. though the, commentator on the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa interprets the word as ‘wife of a maker of gold.’ 9) Cf. perhaps suvarṇaṃ hiraṇyaṃ peśalam in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 4, 5, where peśala probably refers to cunningly-worked gold. But this does not suit the compound peśas-kārī, which must denote a ‘maker of peśas,’ and peśas has not the sense of wrought gold in any passage. Cf. also Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 4, 5; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 261. Pischel, 10) Vedische Studien, 2, 113-125. however, thinks that Peśas never means anything but colour or form.

pesitR|पेसितृ
पेसितृ<BR> is the name of one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 12; Taittirīya Bṛāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 8, 1. The sense is quite uncertain. The word is rendered by the St. Petersburg Dictionary and by Weber 2) Indische Streifen, 1, 75, n. 5. as ‘one who cuts in pieces,’ a ‘carver,’ but Sāyaṇa 3) On Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. thinks that it means one who causes an enmity which has been lulled to rest to break out again.

paingaraaja|पैङ्गराज
पैङ्ग-राज<BR> is the name of one of the victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 13, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 16; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 34. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99. That a bird is meant is certain, but what particular kind is quite unknown.

paingiiputra|पैङ्गीपुत्र
पैङ्गी-पुत्र<BR> (‘son of a female descendant of Piṅga’) is the name of a teacher, pupil of Śaunakīputra, in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 4, 30 Mādhyaṃdina).

paingya|पैङ्ग्य
पैङ्ग्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Piṅga,’ is the name of a teacher who is repeatedly mentioned as an authority in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, 1) viii. 9; xvi. 9; xxvi. 3, 4, 14; xxviii. 7. 9; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, ii. 2. where 2) iii. 1; xix. 9; xxiv. 4. Cf. Paiṅgī saṃpad, xxv. 7. Paiṅgya is found also in the Sāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, iv. 2, 11; xi. 11, 5; 14, 9; xv. 3, 1; xvii. 7, 1, 3; 10, 3; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 11. also his doctrine is called the Paiṅgya. This teacher is further referred to in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 3) xii. 2, 2, 4; 4, 8. (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 3, 17.) which also speaks of Madhuka Paiṅgya. 4) xi. 7, 2, 8; 16. It is, of course, impossible to say whether there was only one Paiṅgya or several Paiṅgyas. The followers of Paiṅgya are called Paiṅgins in the Nidāna 5) iv. 7. and Anupada 6) i. 8; ii. 2, 4, 10; vi. 7; xi. 8. Sūtras. His text-book is called Paiṅga in the Anupada Sūtra, 7) ii. 4; iii. 12; iv. 5. while the Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra 8) v. 15, 8; 29, 4. mentions a Paiṅgāyani Brāhmaṇa. It is clear that Paiṅgya was a teacher of a Rigveda school allied to the Kauṣītakis. Paiṅgi is a patronymic of Yāska in the Anukramanī of the Ātreyī Śākhā. 9) Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 71, n.; 3, 396. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 44, 45, 404 et seq.; 2, 295; Indian Literature, 41, 46, 47, 56, 81, 90, 130, etc. 

paijavana|पैजवन
पैजवन,<BR> ‘descendant of Pijavana,’ is the patronymic of Sudās. 1) Rv. vii. 18, 22. 25; Nirukta, ii. 24. 25; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 34; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 11, 14. It seems most probable that Pijavana intervened in the line of succession between Divodāsa and Sudās, because the two kings have, according to tradition, quite different Purohitas, the former being served by the Bharadvājas as his priests, the latter by Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra; 2) See Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie 1, 104 et seq. this is more natural if they were divided by a period of time than if they had been, as is usually supposed, father and son. Geldner, 3) Rigveda, Glossar, 115. however, identifies Divodāsa and Pijavana.

paidva|पैद्व
पैद्व<BR> See Pedu.

potR|पोतृ
पोतृ<BR> is the name of one of the priests (Ṛtvij) of the sacrificial ritual. Already known to the Rigveda, 1) i. 94, 6; ii. 5, 2; iv. 9, 3; vii. 16, 5; ix. 67, 22. he is frequently mentioned later in the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 10 et seq.; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 3, 4, 22; v. 4, 5, 22; xii. 1, 1, 8, etc. But as Oldenberg 3) Religien des Veda, 383, 391, 395. observes, the Potṛ is not in the later literature a priest of any importance, but is practically a mere name. Judging by the derivation of the name from the root pū, ‘purify,’ it would seem that he was properly engaged in the purification of the Soma pavamāna, ‘Soma purifying itself,’ and was perhaps employed to sing hymns to this Soma. Potra 4) Rv. ii. 1, 2, and probably i. 76, 4, though the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., gives this as an example of the second use. denotes both the office and the Soma vessel of the Potṛ. 5) Rv. i. 15, 2; ii. 36, 2; 37, 2. 4.

pauMshchaleya|पौंश्चलेय
पौंश्चलेय<BR> in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 8, 4, 2) denotes the son of a courtesan (Puṃśealī).

pauMsaayana|पौंसायन
पौंसायन<BR> is the patronymic of Duṣṭarītu in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xii. 9, 3, 1). 

paunjiShTha|पौञ्जिष्ठ
पौञ्जि-ष्ठ<BR> is the form in the Atharvaveda, 1) x. 4, 9. the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 2) xxx. 8. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 3) iii. 4, 5, 1, where Sāyaṇa glosses it with the word kaivarta, also probably the name of a functional caste. of the word Puñjiṣṭha, denoting ‘fisherman.’ It is probably a caste name, ‘son of a Puñjiṣṭha,’ as the designation of a functional caste.

pauNDariika|पौण्डरीक
पौण्डरीक<BR> is the patronymic of Kṣemadhṛtvan in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xxii. 18, 7).

pautakrata|पौतक्रत
पौत-क्रत,<BR> ‘descendant of Pūtakratā,’ is the metronymic of a man, apparently Dasyave Vṛka, in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 56, 2. Scheftelowitz 2) Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 41, 42. proposes to read Pūtakratu with the Kashmir MS. of the Rigveda, arguing that in the same hymn Pūtakratāyī, the wife of Pūtakratu, is referred to, and that therefore Pūtakratu is appropriate, Pūtakratāyī 3) See Pāṇini, iv. 1, 36. being the feminine, like Manāyī, 4) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 8, 6; Pāṇini, iv. 1, 38. Perhaps also Vasāvī, Rv. x. 73, 4. for Manāvī. But the ordinary reading in the sense of descendant is perfectly legitimate, as Oldenberg 5) Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1907, 237. has pointed out.

pautimaaShiiputra|पौतिमाषीपुत्र
पौतिमाषी-पुत्र,<BR> ‘son of a female descendant of Pūtimāṣa,’ is the metronymic of a teacher in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Kāṇva recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 5, 1).

pautimaaShya|पौतिमाष्य
पौति-माष्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Pūtimāṣa,’ is the patronymic of a teacher, a pupil of Gaupavana, in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the Kāṇva recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (ii. 6, 1; iv. 6, 1).

pautimaaShyaayaNa|पौतिमाष्यायण
पौतिमाष्यायण,<BR> ‘descendant of Pautimāṣya’ is the patronymic of a teacher, who, with Kauṇḍinyāyana, taught Raibhya, in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 26). 

pautra|पौत्र
पौत्र<BR> (‘descended from a son’) is the regular term for a ‘grandson’ from the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 5, 30; xi. 7, 16; xviii. 43, 9. onwards. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 10; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 8, 3, etc. When it is used beside Naptṛ, 3) Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 3, 18; Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, x. 11, 5; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 10, 3. Cf. Delbrūck, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 478. the latter word must denote ‘great-grandson.’

paura|पौर
पौर,<BR> ‘descendant of Pūru,’ is the name of a man, presumably a Pūru prince helped by Indra, in a hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 3, 12. The Greek  the name of Alexander's rival, is probably the representative of this word. Oldenberg 2) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 362; as also Grassmann, Wörterbuch, s.v. sees the same name in another passage also. 3) v. 74, 4.

paurukutsa|पौरुकुत्स
पौरु-कुत्स,<BR> 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxii. 3; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 16, 3. Pauru-kutsi, 2) Rv. vii. 19, 3. Pauru-kutsya, 3) Rv. v. 33, 8; viii. 19, 36; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 5, 3. are variant forms of the patronymic of Trasadasyu, the descendant of Purukutsa.

paurushiShTi|पौरुशिष्टि
पौरु-शिष्टि,<BR> ‘descendant of Puruśiṣṭa,’ is the patronymic of Taponitya in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad (i. 9, 1 = Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, vii. 8, 1).

paurNamaasii|पौर्णमासी
पौर्ण-मासी,<BR> denoting the ‘night of the full moon,’ is celebrated in the Atharvaveda 1) vii. 80. as sacred, while it is repeatedly mentioned later. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 9, 1; ii. 2, 2, 1; iii. 4, 9, 6; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 11; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 2, 4, etc. Gobhila 3) i. 5, 7. Three sorts of full moon are distinguished by Gobhila--that which occurs when the full moon rises at the meeting of day and night (sandhyā), when it rises shortly after sunset, or when it stands high in the sky. The two former alternatives are apparently those described in the passage (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 11 = Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1) as pūrvā and uttarā. See Weber, Jyotiṣa, 51; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 30, 26, n. defines it as the greatest separation (vikarṣa) of the sun and the moon. Cf. Māsa. 

pauluShi|पौलुषि
पौलुषि,<BR> ‘descendant of Puluṣa,’ is the patronymic of Satyayajña in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (x. 6, 1, 1) and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (v. 11, 1). In the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (i. 39, 1) the form is Pauluṣita, which is perhaps merely an error.

paulkasa|पौल्कस
पौल्कस<BR> is the name of one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 17; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 14, 1. The name also occurs in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2) iv. 3, 22. as that of a despised race of men, together with the Cāṇḍāla. The Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 3) i. 6, 11. has the variant Puklaka or Pulkaka, clearly the same as Pulkasa, of which Paulkasa is a derivative form, showing that a caste is meant (cf. Kaulāla, Pauñjiṣṭha). In the accepted theory 4) Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., Pukkaśa. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 217, takes Paulkasa as a mixed caste. the Pulkasa is the son of a Niṣāda or Śūdra by a Kṣatriya woman, but this is merely speculative; the Paulkasa may either have been a functional caste, or, as Fick 5) Die sociale Gliederung, 206. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 416, n. 6. believes, an aboriginal clan living by catching wild beasts, and only occasionally reduced to menial tasks.

pauShkarasaadi|पौष्करसादि
पौष्कर-सादि<BR> (‘descendant of Puṣkarasādi’) is the name of a teacher mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 1) vii. 17. Cf. Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 371. as well as the Taittirīya Prātiśākhya. 2) i. 5; ii. 1, 2, 5; Pāṇini, viii. 4, 48; Vārttika, 3; Kielhorn, Indian Antiquary, 16, 103; Pischel, ibid., 34, 26. A Puṣkarasādi is mentioned in the Dharma Sūtra 3) i. 6, 19, 7; 10, 28, 1. of Āpastamba and elsewhere.

pauShpiNDya|पौष्पिण्ड्य
पौष्पिण्ड्य<BR> is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Jaimini, in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) at the end of the Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa. 1) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 377.

pyuxNa|प्युक्ष्ण
प्युक्ष्ण<BR> is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (v. 3, 1, 11) denoting the ‘covering’ for a bow (Dhanus), presumably made of skin. 

prauga|प्रउग
प्रौ१ग<BR> is apparently equivalent to pra-yuga, denoting the fore part of the pole of the cart, the part in front of the yoke. It is mentioned in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 4, 11, 1, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxi. 4. and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 9; iii. 5, 3, 4, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 248; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 14, n. 1. where it is said to be the part of the pole behind the Kastambhī, or prop on which the pole rests.

prakankata|प्रकङ्कत
प्र-कङ्कत<BR> is the name of some noxious insect in the Rigveda. 1) i. 191, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

prakaritR|प्रकरितृ
प्र-करितृ<BR> is the name of one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 12; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 8, 1. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 315, n. 1; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 79, n. 6. The exact sense is uncertain; the commentator Sāyaṇa on the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa explains it to mean the ‘divider of dear ones by producing enmity,’ but the sense of ‘sprinkler’--that is, ‘seasoner’--is more likely.

prakasha|प्रकश
प्र-कश<BR> in the Atharvaveda (ix. 1, 21) seems to mean either the ‘thong’ or the ‘lash’ of a whip.

prakrama|प्रक्रम
प्र-क्रम,<BR> ‘stride,’ is mentioned as a measure of distance in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (x. 2, 3, 1 et seq.), but its exact length in unknown.

praxa|प्रक्ष
प्रक्ष<BR> is the form in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) vi. 3, 10, 2. of the usual name, Plakṣa, of a tree, being merely a phonetic alteration for the sake of the etymology. According to Aufrecht, 2) Rigveda, 2, xlvi. n. the same word is found in two passages of the Sāmaveda, 3) i. 444; ii. 465. the same reading occurring in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka. 4) v. 2, 2, with Keith's notes. Oldenberg, 5) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 344. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 59. however, questions the correctness of the reading Prakṣa, both in the latter passage and in the Sāmaveda. 

pragaatha|प्रगाथ
प्रगाथ<BR> is the name given in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka (ii. 2, 2) to the poets of the eighth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda, so called because they composed Pragātha strophes (that is, verses consisting of a Bṛhatī or Kakubh followed by a Satobṛhatī).

praghaata|प्रघात
प्र-घात<BR> is found in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 1, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiii. 1. The word does not occur in Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 6, 2, 3. and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) iii. 1, 2, 18. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 10, n. 1. in the sense of the closely woven ends of a cloth from which depend the loose threads of the Nīvi, or unwoven fringe.

prachalaakaa|प्रचलाका
प्र-चलाका<BR> in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (vii. 5, 11, 1) and the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (Aśvamedha, v. 2) seems to mean a ‘cloudburst.’

prajaavantpraajaapatya|प्रजावन्त्प्राजापत्य
प्रजावन्त् प्राजापत्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Prajāpati,’ is, according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (i. 21), the author of a hymn of the Rigveda (x. 183).

praNapaat|प्रणपात्
प्र-णपात्<BR> in the Rigveda (viii. 17, 13) denotes ‘greatgrandson.’

praNejana|प्रणेजन
प्र-णेजन<BR> is the word used in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (i. 2, 2, 18) to denote the ‘water used for washing.’

pratataamaha|प्रततामह
प्र-ततामह,<BR> ‘great-grandfather,’ is found in the Atharvaveda (xviii. 4, 75).

pratardana|प्रतर्दन
प्र-तर्दन<BR> is the name in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 1) xxi. 10. of a king who had a Bharadvāja for his Purohita. In the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 2) xxvi. 5. he appears as arriving at the sacrifice of the Ṛṣis in the Naimiṣa forest, and asking them how errors in the sacrifice could be remedied; and as finding Alīkayu Vācaspata, the Brahman priest at the sacrifice, unable to say what was to be done. In the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 3) iii. 1. it is said that Pratardana Daivodāsi went to Indra's world through his death in battle. The patronymic connects him with Divodāsa, the ancestor or father of Sudās, and the mention of Bharadvāja (probably ‘a Bharadvāja’ is meant) as his priest supports the patronymic, for Divodāsa is a special favourite of the singers of the Bharadvāja family. The name, moreover, is reminiscent of the Tṛtsus (the root tard appears in both) and of the Pratṛdaḥ (see Pratṛd). But he is not in Vedic literature a king of Kāśi. 4) As in the Epic; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 38 Geldner 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 138. regards him as Divodāsa's son, but this is not likely. Cf. Prātardani.

pratithidevataratha|प्रतिथिदेवतरथ
प्र-तिथि देव-तरथ<BR> is the name of a teacher, pupil of Devataras Śāvasāyana in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373, 385; Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 444.

pratidiivan|प्रतिदीवन्

pratiduh|प्रतिदुह्
प्रति-दुह्<BR> has the specific sense of ‘fresh milk,’ warm from the cow, in the later Saṃhitās 1) Av. ix. 4, 4; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 3, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 6, etc. and the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ix. 5, 5; xviii. 4, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 3, 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 6, 2, etc.

pratidhaa|प्रतिधा
प्रति-धा<BR> apparently means ‘draught’ or ‘pull’ in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 77, 4; Nirukta, v. 11. where Indra is said to have drunk thirty streams (sarāṃsi) with one Pratidhā.

pratidhi|प्रतिधि
प्रति-धि<BR> is mentioned in the Sūryā hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 85, 8. as part of the chariot on which the bride is taken home. It is impossible to determine with certainty exactly what is meant; Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. understands it to mean a cross-piece of wood fastened to the pole.

pratipaNa|प्रतिपण
प्रति-पण<BR> is found in the Atharvaveda (iii. 15, 4) denoting ‘barter’ or ‘exchange.’ Cf. Paṇa.

pratiprashna|प्रतिप्रश्न
प्रति-प्रश्न<BR> occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) i. 4, 5, 11; iv. 1, 3, 14; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 131, and 26, 267, renders pratipraśnam by ‘(went to Prajāpati) for his decision,’ which leaves it ambiguous how he took the passages. applied to Prajāpati as the decider of doubts; it may have been a technical term for an ‘arbitrator’ (cf. Madhyamaśī and harma).

pratiprasthaatR|प्रतिप्रस्थातृ
प्रति-प्र-स्थातृ<BR> is the name of a priest (Ṛtvij), one of the assistants of the Adhvaryu, in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 3, 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 29; vii. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 2, 2; 3, 13, 22, etc. He is not mentioned in the Rigveda, 2) Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 384, n. 2. but mention is once made in that Saṃhitā 3) ii. 16, 5. of the two Adhvaryus. These may have meant, as later, the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasthātṛ. Oldenberg, 4) Op. cit., 390, n. 2. however, thinks that the Adhvaryu and the Agnīdh are intended, a conjecture for which there is some authority. 5) Cf. Rv. x. 41, 3; Mantra in Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 6, 3. Cf. Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 97.

pratipraash|प्रतिप्राश्
प्रति-प्राश्<BR> See Prāś.

pratibodhiiputra|प्रतिबोधीपुत्र
प्रतिबोधी-पुत्र<BR> is a wrong reading for Prātībodhī-putra. 1) Indische Studien, 1, 391; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 244, 310,

pratimit|प्रतिमित्
प्रति-मित्<BR> is found in the description of a house in the Atharvaveda. 1) ix. 3, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 153; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 596. The sense must be ‘support’ of some sort, probably beams leaning up at an angle against the Upamits. 

prativesha|प्रतिवेश
प्रति-वेश,<BR> ‘neighbour,’ occurs, often metaphorically, from the Rigveda 1) x. 66, 13. onwards. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 97; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 75; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvi. 9; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 5, 2; Taittirīya Upaniṣad, i. 4, 3.

prativeshya|प्रतिवेश्य
प्रति-वेश्य<BR> is mentioned in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) at the end of the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka (xv. 1) as the pupil of Bṛhaddiva. Cf. Prātiveśya.

pratishrutkaa|प्रतिश्रुत्का
प्रति-श्रुत्का,<BR> ‘echo,’ shows that this phenomenon had already received a name as early as the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 14, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 13; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, Aśvamedha, vii. 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 32; xxx. 19. and the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad (iv. 13).

pratiShThaa|प्रतिष्ठा
प्रति-ष्ठा<BR> is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 32, 3 = viii. 8, 21 = Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 14. where Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 181. thinks the word is used as a technical term of law; possibly a ‘sanctuary’ may be meant, but it is more than doubtful whether the sense of ‘home’ or ‘abode,’ as given by Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 3. So a pratiṣṭhā-kāma, ‘one desirous of a fixed abode,’ Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 3, 4; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxiii. 18, 1, etc. is not quite adequate. Cf. Jñātṛ.

pratisara|प्रतिसर
प्रति-सर<BR> is used in several passages of the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 11, 2; iv. 40, 1; viii. 5, 1. 4. and later 2) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 4, 20; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 30, etc. to denote an amulet, according to Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., followed by Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 53, n. 2. because it was a band, and so returned on itself (prati-sṛ, ‘go back’). The sense is doubtful; perhaps ‘attacking’ may really be the root idea. 4) Cf. Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, cxxxiii; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 576. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 263; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 345; Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 164. Cf. Punaḥsara. 

pratihartR|प्रतिहर्तृ
प्रति-हर्तृ<BR> is the name of the assistant of the Udgātṛ in the list of the sixteen priests (Ṛtvij). It is found in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 3, 2, 1. and the Brāhmaṇas, 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 2, 3; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 3, 4, 22; xii. 1, 1, 8; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 15, 3; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 10, 11; 11, 8. but not in the Rigveda. 3) Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 227.

pratiidarshashvaikna|प्रतीदर्शश्वैक्न
प्रती-दर्श श्वैक्न<BR> is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) ii. 4, 4, 3. as sacrificing with the Dākṣāyaṇa offering, and as teaching Suplan Sārñjaya, who thence became Sahadeva Sārñjaya. In a second passage 2) xii. 8, 2, 3. he is called Pratīdarśa Aibhāvata, and again brought into connexion with Suplan Sārñjaya. According to Eggeling, 3) Sacred Books of the East, 44, 239, n. 2. he is to be deemed a king of the Śviknas; apparently, too, he was a descendant of Ibhāvant. A Pratīdarśa is also mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 4) iv. 8, 7.

pratiipapraatisatvana|प्रतीपप्रातिसत्वन
प्रतीप प्रातिसत्वन,<BR> 1) So Khila, v. 15, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 33, 2. or Prātisutvana, 2) So Av. xx. 129, 2. Cf. Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 161; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 18, 1. is the name of a man mentioned in a hymn of the Atharvaveda. 2) So Av. xx. 129, 2. Cf. Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 161; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 18, 1. Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 131. with great ingenuity, compares the fact that Parikṣit is mentioned as a Kuru king in the Atharvaveda, 4) xx. 127. and that, according to the Epic genealogies, his grandson was Pratiśravas, with which name Prātisutvana, as very possibly a Prākritized version of Prātiśrutvana may be compared, and his great-grandson was Pratīpa. The identification cannot, however, be regarded as at all certain, and while the Epic may have derived its genealogy from the Atharvaveda, it may have preserved an independent tradition. Böhtlingk 5) Dictionary, s.v. renders prātisatvanam as ‘in the direction opposed to the Satvans’, and this may be right. 

pratiibodha|प्रतीबोध
प्रती-बोध<BR> is mentioned with Bodha in two passages of the Atharvaveda, 1) v. 30, 10; viii. 1, 13. Cf. Mānava Gṛhya Sūtra, ii. 15, 1. apparently as the name of a very mythic Ṛṣi, ‘Intelligence.’

pratRd|प्रतृद्
प्रतृद्<BR> occurs once in the plural in a hymn of the Ṛgveda, 1) vii. 33, 14. where it is clearly a variant of the word Tṛtsu. Moreover, the name of King Pratardana, a descendant of the Tṛtsu king, Divodāsa, confirms the identification of Tṛtsu and Pratṛd. 2) See Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 138.

pratoda|प्रतोद
प्र-तोद<BR> denotes in the Atharvaveda 1) xv. 2, 1. and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 2) xvii. 1, 14. See Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 8; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxii. 4, 10; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 6, 7; Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xiv. 72, 3. The rendering ‘lance’ seems to have no authority. But see Weber, Indian Literature, 67. the ‘goad’ of the Vrātya, the non-Brahminical Āryan or aborigine. Later the word is regularly used for ‘goad’ in general.

pratyaxadarshana|प्रत्यक्षदर्शन
प्रत्यक्ष-दर्शन,<BR> n., means ‘seeing with one's own eyes,’ as opposed to seeing in a vision (svapna). A section on such visions appears in the Rigveda Āraṇyakas. 1) Aitareva Āranyaka, iii. 2, 4; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, viii. 7.

pratyenas|प्रत्येनस्
प्रत्य्-एनस्<BR> is found with Ugra and Sūta-grāmaṇī in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 1) iv. 3, 43. 44 (Mādhyaṃdina = iv. 3, 37. 38 Kāṇva). clearly denoting an officer of police. The sense must be that of the humbler ‘servants’ of the king 2) Böhtlingk's Translation, p. 66, where he takes ugra as an adjective. rather than ‘magistrates,’ as Max Müller, in his translation, takes it. In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 3) viii. 4 (Indische Studien, 3, 463). and the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 4) iv. 16, 16. 17. the word means, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, the next heir, who is responsible for the debts of a dead man. 

pradara|प्रदर
प्र-दर<BR> in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 35, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 10, 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 2, 3, 8; xiii. 8, 3, 10, etc. denotes a ‘cleft’ in the ground. ^1 Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 8, 5; v. 2, 4, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxv. 7.

pradiv|प्रदिव्
प्र-दिव्<BR> in the Atharvaveda (xviii. 2, 48) is the third and highest heaven, in which the Fathers dwell. In the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (xx. 1) it is the fifth of a series of seven heavens.

pradish|प्रदिश्
प्र-दिश्,<BR> like Diś, normally designates only a ‘quarter’ of the sky, or ‘point’ of the compass. Four, 1) Rv. i. 164, 42; vii. 35, 8; x. 19, 8; Av. i. 11, 2; ii. 10, 3. five, 2) Rv. ix. 86, 29; Av. i. 30, 4; iii. 4, 2; 20, 9. six, 3) Av. iv. 11, 1; 20, 2; x. 7, 35. and seven 4) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 32. such points are enumerated, or more generally ‘all’ are mentioned. 5) Rv. vi. 75, 2; x. 121, 4. In some passages, 6) Av. v. 28, 2; ix. 2, 21; xix. 20, 2, etc. on the other hand, the word has the definite sense of an ‘intermediate quarter,’ which is more precisely denoted by avāntara-diś.

pradhana|प्रधन
प्र-धन<BR> denotes ‘contest,’ whether the real conflict of war or the competition of the chariot race, in the Rigveda. 1) i. 116, 2; 154, 3; 169, 2; x. 102, 5, etc.

pradhi|प्रधि
प्र-धि<BR> is the name of some part of the wheel of a chariot, probably the ‘felly.’ In one passage of the Rigveda, 1) ii. 39, 4. and in one of the Atharvaveda, 2) vi. 70, 3. the ‘nave’ (Nabhya) and the ‘felly’ (pradhi) are mentioned along with the Upadhi, which must then be either a collective name for the spokes or an inner rim within the felly and binding the spokes. In the riddle hymn of the Rigveda 3) i. 164, 48. twelve Pradhis are mentioned with three naves, one wheel, and three hundred and sixty spokes; what exactly is here meant by this particular term it would be useless to conjecture, though it is clear that the passage as a whole symbolizes the year with three seasons, twelve months, and three hundred and sixty days. Elsewhere 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 11, 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 15; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 5, 23. the nave and the Pradhi alone are mentioned, or the Pradhi occurs by itself. 5) Rv. iv. 30, 15; x. 102, 7, etc. In Av. xviii. 2, 14, Pradhāv adhi is merely an incorrect variant of the pradhāvati of Rv. x. 154, 1. The same corruption is seen by Lanman (in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, xcii) in Av. vi. 70, 3 (n. 2). Cf. Whitney, op. cit., 334; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 248.

pradhvaMsana|प्रध्वंसन
प्र-ध्वंसन<BR> See Prādhvaṃsana

prapaNa|प्रपण
प्र-पण<BR> in the Atharvaveda (xii. 15, 4. 5) denotes ‘barter’ or ‘exchange,’ balanced by Pratipaṇa.

prapatha|प्रपथ
प्र-पथ<BR> in the Rigveda 1) x. 17, 4. 6; 63, 16. and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 2) vii. 15. denotes a ‘long journey.’ Wilson 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 151. has seen in one passage 4) Rv. i. 166, 9. the sense of ‘resting-place,’ where travellers can obtain food (khādi). Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 231. shows that this is impossible, and the reading (prapatheṣu) in the passage in question is not improbably 6) Roth. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 108; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 166. Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v., does not follow Roth. an error for prapadeṣu. In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 7) xxxvii. 14 (Indische Studien, 3, 466). the word means a ‘broad road.’

prapathin|प्रपथिन्
प्र-पथिन्<BR> 1) Prapathī might be the stem, the word occurring as a proper name in the nominative singular only (cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammer, 377, 3); but this is not probable, the stem prapathin being otherwise found as an adjective is the name of a patron, perhaps a Yādava, in one hymn of the Rigveda. 2) viii. 1, 30. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 90. 

prapaa|प्रपा
प्र-पा<BR> seems to denote a ‘spring’ in the desert in the only Rigveda passage where it occurs. 1) x. 4, 1. In the Atharvaveda 2) iii. 30, 6. Cf. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 1, 2. it has merely the sense of ‘drinking,’ or a ‘drink.’

prapitaamaha|प्रपितामह
प्र-पितामह,<BR> ‘great-grandfather,’ is found in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 5, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 36; Av. xviii. 4, 35. and the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 2, 16; xii. 8, 1, 7.

prapitva|प्रपित्व
प्र-पित्व<BR> is found in several passages of the Rigveda as a designation of time. In one passage 1) viii. 1, 29. the sense is made clear by the context: ‘at the rising of the sun’ (sūra udite), ‘at midday’ (madhyaṃdine divaḥ), and ‘at the Prapitva, bordering on the night’ (apiśarvare). In another passage 2) vii. 41, 4. the sense of ‘late in the day’ also seems adequate, while the phrase 3) iv. 16, 12. abhipitve ahnaḥ, ‘at the close of day,’ also denotes the evening. According to Geldner, 4) Vedische Studien, 2, 174 et seq. the sense of the word is the ‘decisive moment’ in a race or a battle, and so the ‘end of the day.’ 5) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., took it to mean ‘daybreak’; so also Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 362. Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v., on the other hand, gives the meaning as ‘decline of day,’ ‘evening.’ See also Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 24 et seq.; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 183 et seq. Cf. Ahan.

praprotha|प्रप्रोथ
प्र-प्रोथ<BR> is the name in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (viii. 4, 1) of a plant used as a substitute for Soma.

prapharvii|प्रफर्वी
प्र-फर्वी<BR> denotes a ‘wanton woman’ in the Rigveda (x. 85, 22), the Atharvaveda (v. 22, 7), and the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 5, 6; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 7, 12; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvi. 12; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xii. 71.

prabudh|प्रबुध्
प्र-बुध्,<BR> occurring in one passage of the Rigveda (viii. 27, 19), is used in the locative parallel with nimruci, ‘at the setting (of the sun),’ and clearly means ‘at the rising (of the sun).’ 

pramaganda|प्रमगन्द
प्र-मगन्द<BR> is the name of a prince in the Rigveda, 1) iii. 53, 14. where he is mentioned as the king of the Kīkaṭas, and where he seems to be designated by the epithet naicāśākha, ‘belonging to a low branch or race.’ On the other hand, Yāska 2) Nirukta, vi. 32. takes Pramaganda to mean the ‘son of a usurer,’ an explanation that is hardly probable. Hillebrandt 3) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 14-16. 241-245. thinks that naicāśākha refers not to Pramaganda, but to the Soma plant, the plant being called nīcāśākha, ‘having shoots turned downwards,’ and that the passage refers to a raid against the Kīkaṭas, who were not observers of the milk cult or the Soma cult, with the intention of winning their lands where the Soma grew and where there were cows. Böhtlingk, 4) Proceedings of the Saxon Academy, December 12, 1891. however, questions this view, which is not very probable. A place name is possibly meant by Naicāśākha. 5) Sāyaṇa, in his introduction to his commentary on the Rigveda, p. 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 31; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 6, 153; Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 58. The name Pramaganda seems un-Āryan.

pramandanii|प्रमन्दनी
प्र-मन्दनी<BR> is the name of an Apsaras in the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 37, 3. Probably the word primarily denoted a certain sweet-scented plant, which seems to be the sense of pra-manda in the Kauśika Sūtra. 2) viii. 17; xxv. 11; xxxii. 29; niṣpramanda, xxxvi. 15. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 69; Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, 15, n. 11.

pramara|प्रमर
प्र-मर<BR> in one passage of the Rigveda 1) x. 27, 20. is taken by Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165. to be a proper name.

pramota|प्रमोत
प्र-मोत<BR> is the name of some sort of disease in the Atharvaveda, 1) ix. 8, 4. according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary. Zimmer, 2) Altindisches Leben, 378, n. however, thinks that the word must be an adjective meaning ‘dumb.’ This view is accepted, though with doubt, by Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 550. and by Bloomfield. 4) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 601. 

prayoga|प्रयोग
प्र-योग<BR> is the name of a seer in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 10, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xix. 10 (Indische Studien, 3, 478).

prayogya|प्रयोग्य
प्र-योग्य<BR> denotes in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (viii. 12, 3) an animal yoked to a carriage, ‘draught animal.’

pralaapa|प्रलाप
प्र-लाप,<BR> ‘prattle,’ is found with other words of similar import in the Atharvaveda, 1) xi. 8, 25. and in the Brāhmaṇas 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 33; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxx. 5; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 17, 6, etc. of the Rigveda. The phrase Aitaśa-pralāpa, ‘Discourse of Aitaśa,’ occurs as a designation of certain passages of the Atharvaveda. 3) See Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, pp. 98, 101, n. 12; Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 159 et seq.; Macdonell, Bṛhaddevatā, 2, 323. The name has no justification in the text itself.

pravachana|प्रवचन
प्र-वचन<BR> means ‘oral instruction,’ ‘teaching,’ in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xi. 5, 7, 1. and later. 2) Taittirīya Upaniṣad, i. 1, 3, 9; Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad, ii. 23; Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad, iii. 2, 3, etc.

pravat|प्रवत्
प्र-वत्,<BR> ‘height,’ is contrasted with Nivat, ‘valley,’ in the Rigveda, 1) vii. 50, 4. where it occurs several times. 2) Rv. ii. 13, 2; iv. 17, 7; 22, 4; vi. 17, 12; vii. 32, 27; x. 14, 1; 57, 12; 75, 4. The word is also found later. 3) Av. i. 13, 2; 26, 3; vi. 28, 3; x. 10, 2; xii. 1, 2; xviii. 4, 7.

pravara|प्रवर
1. Pra-vara denotes properly the ‘summons’ addressed to Agni at the beginning of the sacrifice to perform his functions. But as Agni was then invoked by the names of the ancestors of the Purohita, 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 25. See Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 78. the term Pravara denotes the series of ancestors invoked. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 1, 9; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 1, 1. 20; iii. 7, 4, 9; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 31, etc. 

pravara|प्रवर
2. Pra-vara, 1) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 10. in the Mādhyaṃdina recension. or Pra-vāra, 2) Sāyaṇa on Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, loc. cit.; and Kāṇva recension, vi. 2, 7. denotes a ‘covering’ or ‘woollen cloth’ in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.

pravarta|प्रवर्त
प्र-वर्त,<BR> occurring in the description of the Vrātya in the Atharvaveda (xv. 2, 1, et seq.), is explained by the St. Petersburg Dictionary as a ‘round ornament.’ According to the commentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (2, 453 Bibl. Ind.), it means an ‘ear-ring.’

pravalhikaa|प्रवल्हिका
प्र-वल्हिका,<BR> a ‘riddle,’ is the name given in the Brāhmaṇas of the Rigveda 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 33; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxx. 7. to certain verses of the Atharvaveda. 2) xx. 133; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 22; Khila, v. 16. Cf. Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 98-100.

pravaata|प्रवात
प्र-वात,<BR> ‘a windy spot,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) x. 34, 1; Nirukta, ix. 8. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 119, thinks the reference here is to nuts being blown down in a storm of wind. as the place where the Vibhītaka nuts, used as dice (Akṣa) grow. In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 2) vi. 4, 7, 2. reference is made to the exposure of decaying matter in such a place.

pravaara|प्रवार
प्र-वार<BR> See 2. Pravara.

pravaasa|प्रवास
प्र-वा¤स,<BR> ‘dwelling abroad,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 29, 8. Ceremonies applicable to one who has returned from foreign residence are given in the Sūtras. 2) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 15; Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, ii. 17, etc.

pravaahaNajaivali|प्रवाहणजैवलि
प्र-वाहण जैवलि<BR> or Jaivala (‘descendant of Jīvala’) is the name of a prince, contemporary with Uddālaka, who appears in the Upaniṣads 1) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 1. 7 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 2, 1, 4 Kāṇva); Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 8, 1; v. 3, 1. as engaged in philosophical discussions. He is probably identical with the Jaivali of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 2) i. 38, 4.

prashas|प्रशस्
प्र-शस्<BR> in a Mantra in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) ii. 6, 5. Cf. Durga on Nirukta, v. 11. denotes, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, an ‘axe,’ or some similar instrument for cutting. 2) From śas, ‘to cut.’

prashaastR|प्रशास्तृ
प्र-शास्तृ<BR> is the name of one of the priests (Ṛtvij) at the Vedic sacrifice. In the lesser sacrifices he plays no part at all, but he appears in the animal (paśu) and Soma sacrifices, in the former as the only, in the latter as the main, assistant of the Hotṛ priest in the singing of the litanies. He is mentioned by name in the Rigveda, 1) i. 94, 6; ii. 5, 4; praśāstra, ‘the Soma bowl of the Praśāstṛ,’ 36, 6; praśāstra, ‘the office of the Praśāstṛ,’ ii. 1, 2 = x, 91, 10. and often later. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 21; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 34; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 6, 6, 6; xi. 5, 5, 9, etc. He is also in the Rigveda 3) iv. 9, 5; vi. 71, 5; ix. 95, 5. According to Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 226, the Upavaktṛ is the earliest equivalent of the Ashāvāka. called Upavaktṛ, this name, like Praśāstṛ, being derived from the fact that one of his chief functions was to issue directions (praiṣa) to the other priests. Another name for him was Maitrāvaruṇa, because his litanies were mainly addressed to Mitra and Varuṇa, a connexion already visible in the Rigveda. 4) ii. 36, 6. The ‘two divine Hotṛs’ of the Āprī litanies denote, according to Oldenberg, 5) Religion des Veda, 391. Ludwig, op. cit., 3, 227, identifies the Praśāstṛ with the Prastotṛ, but this is most improbable. Cf. Oldenberg, op. cit., 383, 390, 391; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 141 et seq. the heavenly counterparts of the Hotṛ and the Praśāstṛ.

prashna|प्रश्न
प्रश्न<BR> denotes generally ‘enquiry’ or ‘disputed question,’ the phrase praśnam eti having the sense ‘he asks a person for the decision of a disputed point’ in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) ii. 5, 8, 5; 11, 9. and elsewhere. 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 6, 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 28. Thus Praśna comes to have the definite meaning of ‘decision in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 3) v. 14. In the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda 4) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 10; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 6, 1. are included the Praśnin, the Abhi-praśnin, and the Praśna-vivāka; it is quite likely that here the three parties to a civil case are meant--the plaintiff, the defendant, and the arbitrator or judge (Madhyamaśī).

praShTi|प्रष्टि
प्रष्टि,<BR> like Pṛṣṭyā, denotes a ‘side horse,’ which, however, possibly 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. did not necessarily mean a horse running beside the yoke-horses, but may also have meant a third horse yoked in front as a leader. This seems to be indicated by the reference in the Rigveda 2) i. 39, 6; viii. 27, 8. In i. 100, 17, praṣṭibhiḥ seems to refer to the assistants or comrades of Ṛjrāśva (cf. Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iii. 12, 14); but Ludwig thinks that the word refers to the steeds by which a victory was won. to the Praṣṭi--here applied to the Maruts’ team--leading (vahati) the team (rohitaḥ). In an obscure passage of the Atharvaveda 3) x. 8, 8. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 597. there is a reference to the Praṣṭis in connexion with a pañca-vāhī, ‘drawn by five,’ but it is impossible to gain any clear idea of what is meant. The Praṣṭi is not rarely referred to elsewhere. 4) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 22; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 21, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 3, 9, etc. In one passage 5) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 12, 5. the dhuryau and the praṣṭyau are mentioned together; this probably means the two horses yoked to the pole, with two others fastened in some way one on each side. The adjectives praṣṭimant, 6) Rv. vi. 27, 24. praṣṭi-vāhana, 7) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 4, 9. praṣṭi-vāhin, 8) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 6, 4; 7, 1, 5; 9, 1; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 13, 12 (where praṣṭhi-vāhin and praṣṭi-vāhin are confused). Geldner's conjecture, Rigveda, Glossar, 119, that Praṣṭi denotes a horse yoked in the middle, is withdrawn by himself, Kommentar, 97. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 250; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 102. are all used of Ratha, ‘chariot,’ meaning ‘drawn by a side horse (or horses)’ in addition to the yoke-horses. Cf. Ratha. 

prasiti|प्रसिति
प्र-सिति<BR> in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (ii. 19) and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 7, 13, 4) denotes a divine ‘missile,’ but does not seem to be used of human combatants.

prasuu|प्रसू
प्र-सू<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 95, 10; iii. 5, 8; vii. 9, 3; 35, 7; viii. 6, 20. and later 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvi. 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 1, 18. denotes the young shoots of grass or herbs used at the sacrifice.

prasRta|प्रसृत

Cf. Nirukta, iii. 17. he is mentioned several times. The statement in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 3) xvi. 11, 26. that he obtained bounty from Pṛṣadhra Medhya Mātariśvan is apparently a blunder. 4) Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 39. Cf.

His not being mentioned by name in the Rigveda is merely an accident, for he is clearly referred to in one passage, 2) viii. 81, 5 (pra stoṣat). See Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 393, n. 3. and in the later literature 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 3, 2, 1; vi. 6, 3, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 2, 3; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 34; vii. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 2, 5, 3; v. 4, 5, 22; xii. 1, 1, 6, etc.; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 10, 8, etc. he is a frequent figure.

Somaśuṣma).

praachiinavaMsha|प्राचीनवंश
प्राचीन-वंश<BR> as an adjective denotes ‘having the supporting beam of the roof facing the east’ in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) iii. 1, 1, 6. 7; 6, 1, 23; iv. 6, 8, 20. and the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxii. 13; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 1, 3. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 3, n. 2. The reference is to the central beam running from the middle of the western end of a hall to the middle of the eastern end.

प्राचीन-शाल औपमन्यव<BR> (‘descendant of Upamanyu’) is the name of a householder and theologian in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 1) v. 11, 1. See Mahāśāla. A Prācīnaśāli appears as an Udgātṛ priest in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, 2) iii. 7, 2; 10, 2. and the Prācīnaśālas are mentioned in the same Upaniṣad. 3) iii. 10, 1.

Tilak, 3) Orion, 146, citing Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 1. however, thinks that these terms do not imply the wearing of a thread, but of a garment.

praachya|प्राच्य
प्राच्य<BR> denotes in the plural ‘dwellers in the east.’ They are mentioned in the list of peoples in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 1) viii. 14. It is very probable that the Kāśis, Kosalas, Videhas, and perhaps Magadhas, are meant, as Oldenberg 2) Buddha, 393, n. supposes. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3) i. 7, 3, 8. the Easterns are said to call Agni by the name of Śarva, and their mode of making tombs is there 4) xiii. 8, 1, 5; 2, 1. Cf. also ix. 5, 1, 64. These passages render improbable the earlier view of Weber (Indian Literature, 132, 133) that this Brāhmaṇa is a product of the Eastern peoples, and support his later view that the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, like the other great Brāhmaṇas, belongs to the Madhyadeśa (see Kuru, n. 1). referred to with disapproval. The Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra 5) viii. 6, 9. explains the Vipatha, ‘rough car,’ of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 6) xvii. 1. as a car of the Easterns (prācya-ratha). In the Saṃhitopaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 7) 2; Weber, Indian Literature, 34, n. 25. reference is made to the PrācyaPāñcālas.

praaNa|प्राण
प्राण,<BR> properly denoting ‘breath,’ is a term of wide and vague significance in Vedic literature. It is frequently mentioned from the Rigveda 1) i. 66, 1; x. 59, 6; 90, 13, etc. onwards; in the Āraṇyakas and Upaniṣads it is one of the commonest symbols of the unity of the universe. 2) Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 89 et seq. In the narrow sense Prāṇa denotes one of the vital airs, of which five are usually 3) See Udāna, n. 1. enumerated--Prāṇa, Apāna, Vyāna, Udāna, and Samāna; but often only two, Prāṇa and Apāna, 4) Av. ii. 28, 3; v. 4, 7 (Paipp.); vii. 53, 4 (in vii. 53, 3, Apāna, Prāṇa); Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 1, 4, etc. or Prāṇa and Vyāna, 5) Av. v, 4, 7; vi. 41, 2, etc. or Prāṇa and Udāna; 6) See Udāna, n. 3. or three, Prāṇa, Apāna, and Vyāna, 7) Av. xiii. 2, 46; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 6, 9; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 23; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 29; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, vi. 10; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, viii. 8; Taittirīya Upaniṣad, ii. 2, etc. or Prāṇa, Udāna, and Vyāna, 8) See Udāna, n. 2. or Prāṇa, Udāna, and Samāna; 9) Ibid. or four, Prāṇa, Apāna, Vyāna, and Samāna, 10) Av. x. 2, 13. or Prāṇa, Apāna, Udāna, Vyāna. 11) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad iii. 4, 1. The exact sense of each of these breaths when all are mentioned cannot be determined. 12) Cf. Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 273 et seq.

praaNa|प्राण
प्राण<BR> is also used in a wider sense to denote the organs of sense, 13) Colebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays, 1, 339, 355; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1. or as Sāyaṇa 14) On Aitareya Āraṇyaka, i. 3, 7. puts it, the ‘orifices of the head,’ etc. These are given as six in one passage of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 15) xiv. 1. 3, 32; 4, 1. presumably the eyes, ears, and nostrils. More frequently there are stated to be seven in the head, the mouth being then included. 16) Av. ii. 12, 7; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 17; iii. 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 3, 21; vi. 4, 2, 5; xiii. 1, 7, 2; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 9, 10; 6, 8, etc. Sometimes again they are mentioned as nine, 17) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 5, 10, 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 7, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 2, 5; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxii. 12, 5; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, i. 4, 1; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, ii. 2; Av. v. 28, 1; x. 8, 43 (navadvāram), etc. or as seven in the head and two below. 18) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 9, 10; 6, 8. Ten are counted in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 19) xi. 6, 3, 17, where the eleventh is given as the Ātman. and the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, 20) ii. 77 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 240). while even eleven are mentioned in the Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad, 21) v. 1. and twelve in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 22) xxxiii. 3. where the two breasts are added. Exactly what organs are taken to make up the numbers beyond seven is not certain. 23) Cf. Deussen, op. cit., 269; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaha, 185, 187. The tenth is the navel (nābhi) in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā; 24) iv. 6, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, ix. 16. when eleven are named the Brahma-randhra 25) Aitareya Upaniṣad, i. 3. (suture in the crown) may be included; in the Atharvaveda, 26) x. 8, 9. as interpreted by the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 27) ii. 2, 3, 4. the seventh and eighth are the organs of taste and speech respectively. But usually these make one only, and the eighth and ninth are either in the breast 28) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiii. 3. or below (the organs of evacuation). 29) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 9, 10; 6, 8. The word Prāṇa has sometimes merely the general sense of breath, even when opposed to Apāna. 30) Av. v. 4, 7 (Paippalāda) . See Blloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 552. But its proper sense is beyond question ‘breathing forth,’ ‘expiration,’ and not as the St. Petersburg Dictionary explains it, ‘the breath inspired,’ a version due to the desire to interpret Apāna as ‘expiration,’ a meaning suggested by the preposition apa, ‘away.’ This being clearly shown both by the native scholiasts 31) Rudradatta on Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 8, 8; xiv. 11, 1; Sāyaṇa on Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 3, 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 6, 4; Śaṅkara on Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 3, 2; Ānartīya on Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, vi. 8, 1, 2, etc. and by other evidence, 32) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 2, 15, as compared with Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 8, 29; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 2, 2; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 60, 5; ii. 1, 16. 19; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v. 1, 4. See Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 55, 261-265; 56, 556-558; and Apāna. Böhtlingk 33) Zeitschrift, 55, 518. later accepted the new view.

Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, p. 115. on the other hand, Kusurubinda is called Auddālaki, ‘descendant of Uddālaka,’ a fact which seems to indicate that little value is to be attached to these patronymics and allegations of contemporaneousness.

Its name is altered in the latter Saṃhitā 3) vi. 3, 10, 2. to Prakṣa for the sake of an etymology. It is also mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas. 4) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 32; viii. 16; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 19, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 3, 10, 12, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 58.

In the Rigveda Sūtras 3) Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 6, 1; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 29, 24. Cf.

plati|प्लति
प्लति<BR> is the name of a man, the father of the seer of two hymns of the Rigveda. 1) x. 63, 17; 64, 17. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 133.

Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93. Perhaps the ‘pelican’ is meant.

This version, repeated by Sāyaṇa in his commentary on the Rigveda, 3) viii. 1, 34. Cf. Hopkins, Religions of India, 150. is a mere blunder based on the fact that an additional verse, tacked on to the hymn, 3) viii. 1, 34. Cf. Hopkins, Religions of India, 150. contains the expression śaśvatī nārī, which has been taken to mean ‘his wife Śaśvatī,’ 4) So even Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 107. But see Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 354. instead of merely ‘every woman.’

Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 398; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 19, n. 1. and is explained as meaning an ‘ornament.’ But it is merely a misreading of the correct word phala in the compound phalahastāḥ, ‘bearing fruits in their hands.’

pharvara|फर्वर
फर्वर,<BR> a word occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) x. 106, 2. cannot be interpreted with certainty. It may mean a ‘field in bloom.’ 2) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 260.

According to the Nirukta, 2) vi. 25. Cf. Naighaṇṭuka, iv. 3. the thunderbolt 1) i. 117, 21. is meant; but much more probable is Roth's 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 290; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 466. view, that the object blown was a musical instrument. See also Bākura.

badvan|बद्वन्

babhru|बभ्रु
1. Babhru is the name, in the Rigveda, 1) v. 30, 11. 14. of a Ṛṣi who received gifts from King Ṛṇaṃcaya. The same Babhru may be meant in another passage, 2) viii. 22, 10. where he is mentioned as a protégé of the Aśvins; but it is doubtful whether the word is a proper name at all in the Atharvaveda. 3) iv. 29, 2. It is here taken as a proper name by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 126. But Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 199, denies that a proper name is meant. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 214.

Mahīdhara 3) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit. and Sāyaṇa 4) On Av. xix. 34, 10. interpret the term as ‘consumption.’ Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 385-387. supports this view on the ground that it is mentioned 6) Av. ix. 8, 10. as a kind of Yakṣma, makes the bones and joints fall apart (asthi-sraṃsa, paruḥ-sraṃsa), 7) Av. vi. 14, 1. and is caused by love, aversion, and the heart, 8) ix. 8, 8. characteristics which agree with the statements of the later Hindu medicine. 9) Wise, Hindu System of Medicine, 321, 322. It is in keeping with a demon of the character of consumption that Balāsa should appear as an accompaniment of Takman. 10) Av. iv. 9, 8; xix. 34, 10. Grohmann, 11) Indische Studien, 9, 396 et seq. however, thought that a ‘sore’ or ‘swelling’ (in the case of fever caused by dropsy) was meant. Bloomfield 12) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 450. considers that the question is still open. Ludwig 13) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 510. renders the word by ‘dropsy.’ As remedies against the disease the salve (Āñjasa) from Trikakud 14) Av. iv. 9, 8. and the Jaṅgiḍa 15) Av. xix. 34, 10. plant are mentioned.

bali|बलि
बलि<BR> occurs several times in the Rigveda 1) To a god, Rv. i. 70, 9; v. 1, 10; viii. 100, 9; to a king, in the compound bali-hṛt, ‘paying tribute,’ vii. 6, 5; x. 173, 6. and often later 2) Metaphorically: Av. vi. 117, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 3, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxix. 7; Taittirīya Upaniṣad, i. 5, 3, etc.; bali-hṛt, Av. xi. 4, 19; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, loc. cit.; bali-hāra, Av. xi. 1, 20; literally: Av. iii. 4, 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 18, 3; iii. 12, 2, 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 2, 15; 5, 3, 18; 6, 3, 17; xi 2, 6, 14; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xv. 7, 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 29 (cf. vii. 34); bali-hṛt, Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxix. 9; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 2, 1. in the sense of tribute to a king or offering to a god. Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 166, 167. thinks that the offerings were in both cases voluntary. He compares the notices of the Germans in Tacitus, 4) Germania, 15. where the kings of the tribes are said to receive gifts in kind as presents, but not a regular tribute. There seems to be no ground whatever for this view. No doubt in origin the prerogatives of monarchy were due to voluntary action on the part of the tribesmen, 5) Later, too, benevolences (praṇayākriyā) were known. See Fleet, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 760762. but that the Vedic peoples, who were essentially a body of conquering invaders, were in this state is most improbable, and the attitude of the Vedic Indian to his gods was at least as compatible with tribute as with voluntary gifts. Zimmer admits that in the case of hostile tribes 6) See Rv. vii. 6, 5; 18, 19. tribute must be meant even in the Rigveda. See also Rājan.

balkasa|बल्कस
बल्कस<BR> denotes impure matter given off in the process of fermentation in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) xii. 8, 1, 16; 9, 1, 2. The exact sense may be either ‘scum,’ ‘sediment,’ 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., Flocken (‘flakes’). or perhaps more probably vegetable matter in the form of ‘husks.’ 3) Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 236, n. 1.

balbaja|बल्बज
बल्बज<BR> is the name of the grass called Eleusine indica. It is mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 1) xiv. 2, 22. 23. and is said in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 8, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 10; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 5. to be produced from the excrements of cattle. In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 8, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 10; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 5. it is stated to be used for the sacrificial litter (Barhis) and for fuel. Baskets or other products made from this grass are referred to in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda. 3) viii. 55. 3. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 69, 70.

balhika|बल्हिक
1. Balhika is the name of a people in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 22, 5. 7. 9. where the fever (Takman) is called upon to go to the Mūjavants, the Mahāvṛṣas, and the Balhikas. The Mūjavants are quite certainly a northern tribe, and though, as Bloomfield 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 446. suggests, the passage may contain a pun on Balhika as suggesting ‘outsider’ (from bahis, ‘without’), still no doubt the name was chosen from a northern tribe. But the view of Roth 3) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 41. and Weber, 4) Indische Studien, 1, 205; Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1892, 985-995. which Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 130. once accepted, that an Iranian tribe is referred to (cf. Balkh), is not at all probable. Zimmer 6) Op. cit., 431-433. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 260; Hopkins, Great Epic of India, 373. shows that there is no need whatever to assume Iranian influence. See also Parśu.

balhikapraatipiiya|बल्हिकप्रातिपीय
2. Balhika Prātipīya is the name of a Kuru king in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) xii. 9, 3, 3. where he appears as having been opposed to the restoration of Duṣṭarītu Pauṃsāyana to his hereditary sovereignty over the Sṛñjayas, but as having failed to prevent the restoration being carried out by Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra Sthapati. The epithet Prātipīya is curious: if it connects him with Pratīpa (whose son he is in the Epic), the form is remarkable, Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 432. indeed tacitly altering it to Prātīpīya. In the Epic and the Purāṇas 3) See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 273 et seq.; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 131-136. he is in the form of Vāhlīka made a brother of Devāpi and Śantanu, and a son of Pratīpa. To base chronological conclusions on this 4) Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 52. would be utterly misleading, for the facts are that Devāpi was son of Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa and a priest, while Śantanu was a Kuru prince of unknown parentage, but not probably a son of Pratīpa, who seems to be a late figure in the Vedic age, later than Parikṣit, being his great-grandson in the Epic. Very possibly Balhika was a descendant of Pratīpa. Why he bore the name Balhika must remain uncertain, for there is no evidence of any sort regarding it.

balbuutha|बल्बूथ
बल्बूथ<BR> is mentioned in one hymn of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 46, 32. along with Tarukṣa and Pṛthuśravas, as a giver of gifts to the singer. He is called a Dāsa, but Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. dāsa. was inclined to amend the text so as to say that the singer received a hundred Dāsas from Balbūtha. Zimmer's 3) Altindisches Leben, 117. suggestion that he may have been the son of an aboriginal mother, or perhaps an aboriginal himself, seems probable. 4) Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 30; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 196. If this was the case, it would be a clear piece of evidence for the establishment of friendly relations between the Āryans and the Dāsas.

basta|बस्त
1. Basta denotes the ‘goat’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 161, 13. The passage is unintelligible; for a guess, see Tilak, Orion, 166 et seq., and cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 145, n. 2. and the later literature. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 7, 4; v. 3, 1, 5; 7, 10, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 9; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 7, 7; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 4, 9 (Mādhyaṃdina = i. 4, 4 Kāṇva), etc., and cf. Av. viii. 6, 12; xi. 9, 22. 

bastaraamakaayana|बस्तरामकायन
2. Basta Rāmakāyana is the name of a teacher in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (iv. 2, 10). The patronymic is variously read Samakāyana.

bahuvachana|बहुवचन
बहु-वचन<BR> denotes in grammatical terminology the ‘plural’ in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 5, 1, 18. and the Nirukta. 2) v. 23; xi. 16; xii. 7 (which recognises the plural majestatis). So dvivat, bahuvat, in the Nirukta 3) ii. 24. 27; xi. 16. means ‘in the dual and the plural.’

bahvRcha|बह्वृच
बह्व्-ऋच<BR> denotes an adherent of the Rigveda. The term is found in the Brāhmaṇas 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 36; v. 2; vi. 18; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, vi. 11; xvi. 9. of the Rigveda, in the Śatapatha 2) x. 5, 2, 20; xi. 5, 1, 10. and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇas, 3) v. 6, 6. and in the Āraṇyakas of the Rigveda. 4) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 2, 3; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, viii. 4.

baaNavant|baaNavat|बाणवत्|बाणवन्त्
बाणवन्त्<BR> in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (iii. 8, 2) denotes an ‘arrow’ like Bāṇa. Its more normal sense is ‘quiver’ (lit., ‘containing arrows’), which is its sense in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (xvi. 10) and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (v. 3, 1, 11). 

baadaraayaNa|बादरायण
बादरायण<BR> (‘descendant of Badara’) is the name of a teacher in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) at the end of the Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa. 1) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 377. Bādari is found in the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 3, 18; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 34, n.

baadhyoga|बाध्योग
बाध्योग<BR> (‘descendant of Badhyoga’) is the patronymic of Jihvāvant, a pupil of Asita Vārṣagaṇa, in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 4, 33).

baadhva|बाध्व
बाध्व<BR> is the name of a teacher in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka (iii. 2, 3). The reading in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka (viii. 3) is Vātsya. 1) See Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 249, n. 1.

baabhrava|बाभ्रव
बाभ्रव,<BR> ‘descendant of Babhru,’ is the patronymic of Vatsanapāt in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 (Mādhyaṃdina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Kāṇva). In the legend of Śunaḥśepa 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 17. The Śāṅkhāyana version omits the words. the Kāpileyas and the Bābhravas are enumerated as the descendants of Śunaḥśepa under his adoptive name of Devarāta Vaiśvāmitra. A Sāman, or Chant, of Babhru is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 3) xv. 3, 12.

baabhravya|बाभ्रव्य
बाभ्रव्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Babhru,’ is the patronymic of Girija in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (vii. 1), and of Śaṅkha in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 41, 1; iv. 17, 1).

baarhatsaamaa|बार्हत्सामा
बार्हत्-सामा<BR> is an anomalously formed word meaning ‘daughter of Bṛhatsāman’ in the Atharvaveda, 1) v. 25, 9. Cf Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 267. where her name occurs in a hymn for easy conception. 

baarhaspatya|बार्हस्पत्य
बार्हस्-पत्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Bṛhaspati,’ is the patronymic of the mythical Śaṃyu. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 10, 1; v. 2, 6, 4; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 9, 1, 24; Nirukta, iv. 21, etc.

baala|बाल
बाल<BR> denotes ‘boy,’ ‘young child,’ in the Upaniṣads. 1) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 1, 11; 24, 5; Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad, ii. 6. The later definition 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. makes childhood extend to the sixteenth year.

baalandana|बालन्दन
बालन्दन<BR> is a variant of Bhālandana, the patronymic of Vatsaprī. ^1 See Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 459, 478.

baalaaki|बालाकि
बालाकि, बालाक्या<BR> See Dṛpta-bālāki and Kāśyapī-bālākyāmāṭharī-putra.

baahiika|बाहीक
बाहीक<BR> is applied in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) i. 7, 3, 8. to the people of the west, of the Panjab, 2) Cf. Mahābhārata, viii. 2030 et seq., where the Bāhīkas are defined as the people of the Panjab and the Indus. This coincides exactly with what seems to be meant by the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, which regards as the middle the land to the east of the Sarasvatī. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 189; 2, 37; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 201, n 2. as opposed to the Prācyas or easterns. They are said to have called Agni by the name of Bhava. 

baahu|बाहु

bidalakaarii|बिदलकारी
बिदल-कारी,<BR> ‘female splitter of bamboos,’ is the name of one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 8; bidalakāra, Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 5, 1. Eggeling 2) Sacred Books of the East, 44, 414. renders the word as ‘basket-maker.’

bimba|बिम्ब
बिम्ब<BR> appears in one passage of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 5, 6) to denote the plant Momordica monadelpha.

bilva|बिल्व
बिल्व<BR> is the name of the wood-apple tree (Aigle marmelos). It is mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 4, 8, etc. Cf. Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 9, 3. and in the Atharvaveda, 2) xx. 136, 13. where a reference to its valuable fruit may be intended. According to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 3) ii. 1, 8, 1. 2. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 3, 20 (paridhayaḥ); Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. the sacrificial post was made of Bilva wood in some cases. The Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 4) xii. 20 et seq. contains a hymn in praise of the virtues of an amulet of Bilva (irā-maṇi bailva). 5) At the present day the tree is called Bel, and its leaves are used in the ritual of Siva worship.

bisa|बिस
बिस<BR> denotes the radical fibres of the lotus, which seem to have been eaten as a delicacy as early as the times of the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 34, 5. It is mentioned also in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 2) v. 30. and the Aitareya Āraṇyaka. 3) iii. 2, 4; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xi. 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70. 

biija|बीज
बीज<BR> denotes ‘seed,’ the operation of sowing seed (vap) being several times referred to in the Rigveda 1) x. 94, 13; 101, 3. Cf. metaphorically, x. 85, 37. In v. 53, 13, dhānya bīja means the ‘seed which produces corn.’ and later. 2) Av. x. 6, 33; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 2, 2, 4, etc. In a metaphorical sense the term is used in the Upaniṣads of the classes of beings according to origin, of which the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 3) vi. 3, 1. enumerates three, the Aitareya 4) iii. 3. See Keith. Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 235. four. The former list includes aṇḍa-ja, ‘egg-born,’ jīva-ja, ‘born alive,’ and udbhij-ja, ‘produced from sprouts,’ ‘germinating,’ while the latter adds sveda-ja, ‘sweat-born’--that is, ‘generated by hot moisture,’ an expression which is glossed to comprise flies, worms, etc. Cf. Kṛṣi.

buDilaaashvataraashvi|बुडिलआश्वतराश्वि
बुडिल आश्वतराश्वि<BR> or Āśvatara Āśvi is mentioned several times in the Brāhmaṇa literature as a teacher. According to the Chāndogya 1) v. 11, 1; 16, 1. and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 2) v. 15, 11 (Mādhyaṃdina = v. 14, 8 Kāṇva). Upaniṣads, he was a contemporary of Janaka of Videha, and, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 3) x. 6, 1, 1. Cf. iv. 6, 1, 9. vi. 30. of Aśvapati, the Kekaya king. He is also mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.^4

budhasaumaayana|बुधसौमायन
बुध सौमायन,<BR> ‘descendant of Soma,’ is the name of a teacher mentioned in a verse in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxiv. 18, 6. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 55, n. 2.

bunda|बुन्द
बुन्द<BR> means ‘arrow’ in a few passages of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 45, 4; 77, 6. 11. Cf. Nirukta, vi. 32.

bRbu|बृबु
बृबु<BR> is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda, 1) vi. 45, 31. 33. where he is described as a most generous giver (sahasra-dātama), and as at the head of the Paṇis. According to the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 2) xvi. 11, 11. Bharadvāja received gifts from Bṛbu Takṣan and Prastoka Sārñjaya, a fact alluded to in the Mānava Dharma Śāstra, 3) x. 107. where takṣan is treated as a descriptive attribute, ‘a carpenter.’ Apparently Bṛbu was a Paṇi, though the words of the Rigveda 1) vi. 45, 31. 33. might be taken to mean that he was one who had overthrown them entirely. If so, Paṇi must here certainly mean a merchant in a good sense, Bṛbu being then a merchant prince. 4) Cf. Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 606, n. According to Weber, 5) Episches im vedischen Ritual, 28 et seq.; Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1898, 563, n. 1; Indische Studien, 17, 198. The Bāveru Jātaka, on which stress is laid in connexion with the Indian knowledge of Babylon, being of quite unknown date, has no cogency as evidence for any early period. Cf. Bühler, Indische Palœographie, 17-19; Indische Studien, 3, 79 et seq.; Weber, Indian Literature 3; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 201 et seq. the name suggests connexion with Babylon, but this conjecture must be regarded as quite improbable. Hillebrandt 6) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 93, 104, 107. sensibly expresses no opinion as to Bṛbu, while Brunnhofer's 7) Iran und Turan, 127. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 275; Bṛhaddevatā, v. 108, 109, with Macdonell's notes; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 316. attempt to recognize a people named , and to connect them with the Vedic word takṣan, is valueless, especially considering the fact that Takṣan is not found as an epithet of Bṛbu in the Rigveda.

bRsaya|बृसय
बृसय<BR> is mentioned twice in the Rigveda, being in the first passage 1) i. 93, 4. connected with the Paṇis, and in the second 2) vi. 61, 3. with the Pārāvatas and the Paṇis. According to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, the word is the name of a demon, 3) Cf. Sāyaṇa on Rv., loc., cit. but is in the second passage 2) vi. 61, 3. used as an appellative, perhaps meaning ‘sorcerer.’ 4) Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v., following Grassmann. Hillebrandt 5) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 97-104. thinks that a people is meant locating them in Arachosia or Drangiana with the Pārāvatas and the Paṇis, and comparing , satrap of Arachosia and Drangiana in the time of Darius. 6) Arrian, Indica, viii. 4; xxi. 1; xxv. 8. But this theory is not probable. 

bRsii|बृसी
बृसी,<BR> denoting a ‘cushion’ of grass, is mentioned in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka 1) i. 2, 4; v. 1, 3, with Keith's note; 3, 2. and the Sūtras. 2) Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xvii. 4, 7; 6, 6; Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, xiii. 3, 1. The incorrect forms Vṛśī and Vṛṣī also occur occasionally.

bRhachChandas|बृहच्छन्दस्
बृहच्-छन्दस्<BR> is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 12, 3. as an epithet of Śālā, ‘house.’ It is apparently 2) Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 105. an error for bṛhad-chadis, ‘broad-roofed,’ which in any case is the sense. 3) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 345.

bRhatsaaman|बृहत्सामन्
बृहत्-सामन्<BR> is mentioned in the Atharvaveda (v. 19, 2) as an Āṅgirasa who was oppressed by Kṣatriyas. The latter are said to have been ruined in consequence. Cf. Sṛñjaya and Bārhatsāmā.

bRhaduktha|बृहदुक्थ
बृहद्-उक्थ<BR> is mentioned in an obscure hymn of the Rigveda 1) v. 19, 3, where Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. treats it as adjectival. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft. 42, 214; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 126. as a priest; in two hymns of the tenth Maṇḍala 2) x. 54, 6; 56, 7. he is definitely a Ṛṣi. He is also mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 3) viii. 23. as having consecrated Durmukha Pāñcāla, and is called Vāmadeva's son in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 4) xiii. 2, 2, 14. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 5) xiv. 9, 37, 38. he appears as Vāmneya, ‘descendant of Vāmnī.’ Hopkins 6) Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 55, n. 2. suggestion that he may have been there thought of as Vāmadevya also is quite probable. 7) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 9, 27, is parallel with xiv. 9, 38.

bRhadgiri|बृहद्गिरि
बृहद्-गिरि<BR> is said in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (viii. 1, 4) to have been one of the three Yatis who survived the slaughter of them by Indra. A Sāman, or Chant, of his is mentioned in the same Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 4, 15-17). 

bRhaddiva|बृहद्दिव
बृहद्-दिव<BR> appears in a hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 120, 8. 9. as its author, calling himself an Atharvan. He is mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 2) iv. 14. and is named in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 3) xv. 1. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 133; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 141. as a pupil of Sumnayu.

bRhadratha|बृहद्रथ
बृहद्-रथ<BR> is mentioned twice in the Rigveda, 1) i. 36, 18; x. 49, 6. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 147, 148. in both cases beside Navavāstva. The name may thus be an epithet of Navavāstva.

bRhadvasu|बृहद्वसु
बृहद्-वसु<BR> is the name of a teacher in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 374.

bRhaspati|बृहस्पति
बृहस्पति,<BR> ‘lord of prayer,’ is the name of a god in the Vedic texts. The view of Thibaut, 1) Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik. 6. that the name designates the planet Jupiter, is certainly not supported by good evidence. Oldenberg 2) Nachrichten der königlichen Gesellschaft der Wessenschaften zu Göttingen, 1909, 568, n. 3; Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, xciv, correcting Tilak, Orion, 101. See also Fleet, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1911, 514-518; Keith, ibid., 794-800. seems clearly right in rejecting it.

bRhaspatiguptashaayasthi|बृहस्पतिगुप्तशायस्थि
बृहस्पति-गुप्त शायस्थि<BR> is mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. as a pupil of Bhavatrāta Śāyasthi.

bRhaspatisava|बृहस्पतिसव
बृहस्पति-सव<BR> is the name of a sacrifice by which, according to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 1) ii. 7, 1, 2. Cf. Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 7; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 11, 4; xxv. 1, 1, 7. the priest who desired to become a Purohita obtained that office. According to the Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 2) ix. 9. 5. it was the sacrifice to be performed by a priest after the Vājapeya, while the king performed the Rājasūya. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 3) v. 2, 1, 19. on the other hand, the Bṛhaspatisava is identified with the Vājapeya; but such identity is clearly not primitive. 4) Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, xxiv, xxv; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 107, 108.

bekanaaTa|बेकनाट
बेकनाट<BR> occurs only once in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 16, 10. when Indra is said to overcome all the Bekanāṭas and the Paṇis. The natural sense, therefore, seems to be ‘usurer,’ the explanation given by Yāska. 2) Nirūkta, vi. 26. The word has a foreign appearance, but its provenance can hardly be determined: it might just as well be aboriginal as Babylonian. 3) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 44. Hillebrandt 4) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 268, n. 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 259. thinks Brunnhofer is right in identifying Bekanāṭa with Bikanir.

bekuraa|बेकुरा
बेकुरा<BR> occurs in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 1) i. 3, 1; vi. 7, 6; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 82. where it may mean ‘voice’ or ‘sound,’ the sense assigned to the word in the Naighaṇṭuka. 2) i. 11. It is, however, possibly, like Bakura, the name of a musical instrument. In the Taittirīya 3) iii. 4, 7, 1. and the Kāṭhaka 4) xviii. 14. Saṃhitās the words Bekuri and Vekuri occur as epithets of Apsarases, or celestial nymphs, meaning, perhaps, ‘melodious’; in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 5) xviii. 42. and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 6) ix. 4, 1, 9. the variations Bhakuri and Bhākuri are found.

baijavaapa|बैजवाप
बैज-वाप,<BR> ‘descendant of Bījavāpa,’ is the name of a teacher in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 26).

baijavaapaayana|बैजवापायन
बैज-वापायन,<BR> ‘descendant of Baijavāpa,’ is the name of a teacher in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 26). The name is also spelt Vaijavāpāyana. 

baijavaapi|बैजवापि
बैज-वापि,<BR> ‘descendant of Bījavāpa, or Bījavāpin,’ is the name of a teacher in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (i. 4, 7).

bainda|बैन्द
बैन्द<BR> is the name of one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 16; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 12, 1. According to the commentator Mahīdhara, the word denotes a Niṣāda, but according to Sāyaṇa a catcher of fish. See Mṛgayu.

bodha|बोध
बोध<BR> is the name of a Ṛṣi in the Mantra Pāṭha. 1) ii. 16, 14. Cf. Winternitz, Mantrapāṭha, xiv. He is mentioned with Pratibodha in the Atharvaveda, 2) v. 30, 10; viii. 1, 13. but Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 474. thinks that in the second passage, at least, the word is an ordinary noun meaning ‘the wakeful one.’

baudhaayana|बौधायन
बौधायन,<BR> ‘descendant of Budha or Bodha,’ is the name of a teacher who is mentioned in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 1) iv. 11, etc. and under whose name are current a Śrauta Sūtra described 2) U7ber das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 1903. and in part edited by Caland, 3) Bibliotheca Indica, 1904, etc. and a Dharma Sūtra which has been edited 4) By Hultzsch, Leipzig, 1884. and translated, 5) Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, 14. See his Introduction, xxix et seq., where, however, he tends to overestimate considerably the age of Baudhāyana. while the Gṛhya Sūtra is still unedited.

baudhiiputra|बौधीपुत्र
बौधी-पुत्र,<BR> ‘son of a female descendant of Bodha,’ is the name of a pupil of Śālaṅkāyanīputra in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāranyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 4, 31).

brahmacharya|ब्रह्मचर्य
ब्रह्म-चर्य<BR> denotes the condition of life of the Brahmacārin 1) Rv. x. 109, 5; Av. vi. 108, 2; 133, 3; xi. 5, 1 et seq.; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 3, 3, 1, etc. or religious student. The technical sense is first found in the last Maṇḍala of the Rigveda. 2) Rv., loc. cit. The practice of studentship doubtless developed, and was more strictly regulated by custom as time went on, but it is regularly assumed and discussed in the later Vedic literature, being obviously a necessary part of Vedic society The Atharvaveda 3) xi. 5. Cf. Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 1-8, which contains an independent account of the Brahmacārin (Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 110); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 3, 3, 1 et seq.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 3, 10, 5. has in honour of the Brahmacārin a hymn which already gives all the characteristic features of religious studentship. The youth is initiated (upa-nī) by the teacher 4) Av. xi. 5, 3. It is used in the ritual of the Upanayana, according to the Kauśika Sūtra, lv. 18. into a new life; he wears an antelope skin, and lets his hair grow long; 5) Av. xi. 5, 6. he collects fuel, 6) Av. xi. 5, 4, 6. and begs, 7) Av. xi. 5, 9. learns, and practises penance. All these characteristics appear in the later literature. The student lives in the house of his teacher (ācārya-kula-vāsin; 8) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, ii. 23, 2. So regularly brahma-caryeṇa vas, Av. vii. 109, 7; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 14, etc.; or car, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 3, 3, 7; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, 6, 3, etc. ante-vāsin); 9) Ibid., iii. 11, 5; iv. 10, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 3, 15 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 3, 7 Kāṇva); Taittirīya Upaniṣad, i. 3, 3; 11. 1. he begs, 10) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 3, 5. Cf. Av. vi. 133, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 3, 3, 5. looks after the sacrificial fires, 11) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 10, 2 et seq.; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. xi. 3, 3, 4. and tends the house. 12) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 6, 2, 15. A Mantra in the Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 22, 1. 2, and elsewhere, sums up the duties of the Brahmacārin as ‘thou art a Brahmacārin: eat water; perform thy duty; sleep not in the daytime; obedient to thy teacher study the Veda (brahmacāry asy; apo ‘śāna; karma kuru; divā mā svāpsīr; ācāryāyādhīno vedam adhīṣva).’ One duty specially referred to in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 1, 6; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, vii. 19, and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 5, 5, was the guarding of the teacher's cattle when they were grazing on their pasture grounds. From these grounds, too, the pupil would, no doubt, bring dried dung for fuel, as well as any available sticks. As regards obedience to the teacher, cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 3, 3, 6. His term of studentship might be long extended: it was normally fixed at twelve years, 13) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 10; vi. 1, 2. but much longer periods, such as thirty-two years, are mentioned. 14) Ibid., viii. 7, 3 (thirty-two years); 15 (for life), etc. The age at which studentship began varied. 15) See Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 21. The Sūtras allowed for a Brāhmaṇa the ages 8-16; for a Kṣatriya, 11-22; for a Vaiśya, 12-24. The difference between the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya, compared with that between the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya, shows that the two latter castes were in a different position from the Brāhmaṇa. Śvetaketu commenced at twelve and studied for twelve years. 16) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 2. It is assumed in the Gṛhya Sūtras that the three Āryan castes were all required to pass through a period of studentship. But that this is much more than priestly schematism is uncertain. No doubt individuals of the Kṣatriya or Vaiśya caste might go through part of the period of studentship, just as Burmese boys of all classes now pass some time in a monastery as students. This is borne out by the reference in the Atharvaveda 17) xv. 5, 17. Cf. Lanman in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 639. to the king guarding his country by Brahmacarya--though that is susceptible of a different interpretation--and more clearly by the reference in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 18) ix. 16 (reading abrāhmaṇa) . to a rite intended to benefit one who, although not a Brahmin, had studied (vidyām anūcya), but had not gained renown, and by references in the Upaniṣads to kings who like Janaka studied the Vedas and the Upaniṣads. 19) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 2, 1. Normally, however, the Kṣatriya studied the art of war. 20) Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 106-113. One of the duties of the Brahmacārin was chastity. But reference is in several places 21) Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, x. 65; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 10, 9. made to the possibility of misconduct between a student and the wife of his preceptor, nor is any very severe penance imposed in early times--later it is different--for such a sin. In certain cases the ritual required a breach of chastity, no doubt as a magic spell to secure fertility. 22) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 5; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 9, 4; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 125, n. 1; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 79. Even an old man might on occasion become a pupil, as the story of Āruṇi shows. 23) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 6 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 2, 4 Kāṇva). Cf. von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 202, 203; Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 151; Weber, op. cit., 10, 121 et seq.; Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 370, 371, and see Brāhmaṇa. 

brahmajya|ब्रह्मज्य
ब्रह्म-ज्य,<BR> 1) v. 19, 7. 12; xii. 5, 15 et seq.; xiii. 3, 1. Cf. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, 9, 2. ‘oppressor of a Brahmin,’ and Brahma-jyeya, 2) Av. xii. 4, 11. ‘oppression of a Brahmin,’ are terms mentioned several times in the Atharvaveda as expressing a heinous crime which involves its perpetrator in ruin. See Brāhmaṇa.

brahmadattachaikitaaneya|ब्रह्मदत्तचैकितानेय
ब्रह्म-दत्त चैकितानेय<BR> (‘descendant of Cekitāna’) is the name of a teacher in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (i. 3, 26). He is mentioned also in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad (i. 38, 1; 59, 1) as patronized by Abhipratārin, the Kuru king.

brahman|ब्रह्मन्
1. Brahman (neut.) denotes the priestly class as opposed to the warrior class and the people (Kṣatra and Viś). The term is found in the Atharvaveda, 1) ii. 15, 4; ix. 7, 9; xii. 5, 8; xv. 10, 3, 4. and repeatedly later on. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 3, 1, 1, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vi. 3; vii. 21, etc. See also Varṇa and Kṣatra. For the position, etc., of this class, see Brāhmaṇa.

brahman|ब्रह्मन्
2. Brahman is found in many passages of the Rigveda and later in the sense of ‘priest.’ In many passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 80, 1; 164, 34; ii. 2, 6; vi. 45, 7; vii. 33, 11; viii. 16, 7; x. 71, 11; 77, 1; 85, 3, 16. 34; 107, 6; 117, 7; 125, 5; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 244-246. he is referred to as praising the gods; in others 2) i. 10, 1; 33, 9; 101, 5; 108, 7; 158, 6; ii. 39, 1; iv. 50, 8, 9; 58, 2; v. 29, 3; 31, 4; 32, 12; 40, 8; vii. 7, 5; 42, 1; viii. 7, 20; 17, 2; 31, 1; 32, 16; 33 19; 45, 39; 64, 7; 77, 5; 92, 30; 96, 5; ix. 96, 6; 112, 1; 113, 6; x. 28 11; 71, 11; 85, 29; 141, 3; Muir, op. cit., 12, 246-251. the sense of ‘priest’ is adequate. In not a few cases 3) i. 108, 7; iv. 50, 8, 9; viii. 7, 20; 45, 39; 64, 7; 92, 30; ix. 112, 1; x. 85, 29; Muir, 12, 258. the priesthood as a profession is clearly alluded to, nor is there any reason to doubt 4) Loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 190 et seq. that in all cases the word has the technical sense of a member of the priesthood. There is, however, considerable doubt as to the number of cases in the Rigveda, where it has the technical sense of the priest who guides the sacrifice generally. It is undoubtedly found in that sense, both Muir 5) Op. cit., 12, 251, citing ii. 1, 2 (= ix. 91, 10); iv. 9, 4; x. 52, 2. and Roth 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2, citing ii. 1, 2; ix. 96, 6; x. 71, 11; 107, 6. In none of the last three passages is the specific sense cogently required. recognizing instances of its being used thus. Geldner, 7) Vedische Studien, 2, 145 et seq.; 3, 155. He thinks that the sense of ‘superintending priest’ is the older, and sees it in i. 158, 6; iv. 9, 4; 50, 7. 8; vii. 7, 5; 33, 11; x. 141, 3, etc. however, is anxious to find that sense in a large number of passages, and insists that the Purohita was normally a Brahman in the narrower sense. Oldenberg, 8) Religion des Veda, 396, 397, who thinks that the Brahman priest known to the Rigveda was the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin and who in most passages (e.g., iv. 50, 7. 8) sees only the sense of ‘priest.’ Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 376, 377. on the other hand, holds with greater probability that in most of the passages adduced Brahman means simply ‘priest,’ and that the Purohita, who was essentially not a member of the ordinary body of sacrificing priests (Ṛtvij), was, when he officiated at the sacrifice, more usually the Hotṛ priest, and only later became the Brahman. This change he regards as having taken place when the importance of the hymns declined, and most weight was laid on the functions of the priest who superintended the sacrifice as a whole, and by his magic repaired the flaws in the sacrifice. 9) Cf. Pischel, Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1894, 420; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 13; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, lxviii; Atharvaveda, 32; and see Purohita. In the later literature both senses of the word are quite common. 10) As ‘priest,’ Av. ii. 7, 2; iv. 35, 1. 2; v. 8, 5; 17, 8; 18, 7; 19, 8; vi. 122, 5; viii. 9, 3; x. 1, 3; 4, 30. 33; 7, 24; xi. 1, 25; xii. 1, 38; xix. 32, 8; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 7, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxvi. 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, etc. As ‘superintending priest,’ Av. xviii. 4, 15; xx. 2, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 9, 1; ii. 3, 11, 4; iii. 5, 2, 1, etc.; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 17; and see Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 34, 35; 114; 135-138; 327; 330-337.

brahmaputra|ब्रह्मपुत्र
ब्रह्म-पुत्र<BR> in a few passages is used in the sense of a ‘priest's son.’ ^1 Rv. ii. 43, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 4, 1, 2. 9. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 43, 69; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 252. 

brahmapurohita|ब्रह्मपुरोहित
ब्रह्म-पुरोहित<BR> is found in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 1) xix. 10; xxvii. 4. and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) xii. 8, 3, 29. where the St. Petersburg Dictionary gives the sense as ‘having the priesthood as its Purohita.’ This seems rather doubtful; more probably the sense should be ‘having a Brahman priest as Purohita,’ unless the word merely means ‘having the priesthood superior to it,’ as an epithet of Kṣatra, the ‘warrior caste,’ which seems to be Weber's view. 3) Indische Studien, 10, 30.

brahmabandhu|ब्रह्मबन्धु
ब्रह्म-बन्धु<BR> (‘priest fellow’) denotes, in a deprecatory sense, an ‘unworthy priest,’ ‘priest in name only,’ in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) vii. 27. and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 2) vi. 1, 1. Cf. Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 6, 28; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxii. 4, 22; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 29, 9; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 99, 100. Cf. Rājanyabandhu.

Brahma-vadya is the form found in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, 2) xxvii. 4. and Brahma-vādya in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 3) ii. 5, 8, 3. Cf. Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 172; Religion of the Veda, 216 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 118, 119; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 390 et seq.; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 452, 453. probably has the same sense.

brahmopaniShad|ब्रह्मोपनिषद्

braahmaNa|ब्राह्मण
1. Brāhmaṇa, ‘descendant of a Brahman’ (i.e., of a priest), is found only a few times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 164, 45; vi. 75, 10; vii. 103, 1. 7. 8; x. 16, 6; 71, 8. 9; 88, 19; 90, 12; 97, 22; 109, 4. See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 251-257; Roth, Nirukta, Erläuterungen, 126; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., where Rv. viii. 58, 1, is added; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 220-226. and mostly in its latest parts. In the Atharvaveda 2) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 1; v. 17, 9; 18, 1 et seq.; 19, 2 et seq.; xi. 1, 28; xix. 34, 6; 35, 2, etc. and later 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 7, 2; ii. 1, 2, 8, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vii. 46. etc. it is a very common word denoting ‘priest,’ and it appears in the quadruple division of the castes in the Puruṣa-sūkta (‘hymn of man’) of the Rigveda. 4) x. 90. It seems certain that in the Rigveda this Brāhmaṇa, or Brahmin, is already a separate caste, differing from the warrior and agricultural castes. 5) Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 235; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 146, n. 1; and see Varṇa. The texts regularly claim for them a superiority to the Kṣatriya caste, 6) See Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 8; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxix. 10; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 21; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 4, 15; xiii. 1, 9, 1; 3, 7, 8; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 15; viii. 9; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ii. 8, 2; xi. 11; 9; xv. 6, 3; and cf. Brahmapurohita; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 27 et seq. and the Brahmin is able by his spells or manipulation of the rite to embroil the people and the warriors 7) See Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 7; iii. 3, 10; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 11, 2, etc. or the different sections of the warriors. 8) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 3, 10. If it is necessary to recognize, as is sometimes done, that the Brahmin does pay homage to the king at the Rājasūya, 9) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 4, 23 (Mādhyaṃdina = i. 4, 11 Kāṇva). Cf. Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxviii. 5; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 3, 2; v. 4, 2, 7. Contrast the claim that Soma alone is King of the Brahmins, Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 18; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 2, 3. nevertheless the unusual fact is carefully explained away so as to leave the priority of the Brahmin unaffected. But it is expressly recognized that the union of the Kṣatriya and the Brāhmaṇa is essential for complete prosperity. 10) See Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 10, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xix. 10; xxvii. 4; xxix. 10; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 3; 7, 7; iii. 1, 9; 2, 3; iv. 3, 9; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xx. 25; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xix. 17, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 4, 6; v. 4, 4, 15; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 10. 17, 24, 25, etc. Cf. Purohita. It is admitted 11) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 8, 7; Pañcavimśa Brāhmaṇa, xviii. 10, 8; Av. v. 1719; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 2, 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 1, 5, 4. that the king or the nobles might at times oppress the Brahmins, but it is indicated that ruin is then certain swiftly to follow. The Brahmins are gods on earth, 12) Av. v. 3, 2; vi. 13, 1; 44, 2; xix. 62, 1 (compared with xix. 32, 8), and probably v. 11, 11; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 7, 3, 1; ii. 5, 9, 6; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, viii. 13; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 4, 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 2, 6; 4, 3, 14; iii. 1, 1, 11; iv. 3, 4, 4. See Weber, op. cit., 10, 35, 36; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 146, 147. like the gods in heaven, but this claim is hardly found in the Rigveda. 13) Neither in i. 139, 7, nor ix. 99, 6 (see Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, (s.v. deva), is this sense at all probable. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 206, quotes 1, 128, 8, but that also is uncertain. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 14) vii. 29, 2. Cf. Varṇa. n. 71. the Brahmin is said to be the ‘recipient of gifts’ (ādāyī) and the ‘drinker of the offering’ (āpāyī). The other two epithets applied, āvasāyī and yathākāma-prayāpya, are more obscure; the former denotes either ‘dwelling everywhere’ 15) Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 326. or ‘seeking food’; 16) Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 439. the latter is usually taken as ‘moving at pleasure,’ but it must rather allude to the power of the king to assign a place of residence to the Brahmin. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 17) xi. 5, 7, 1 et seq. See Weber, op. cit., 10, 41 et seq. the prerogatives of the Brahmin are summed up as (1) Arcā, ‘honour’; (2) Dāna, ‘gifts’; (3) Ajyeyatā, ‘freedom from oppression’; and (4) Avadhyatā, ‘freedom from being killed.’ On the other hand, his duties are summed up as (5) Brāhmaṇya, ‘purity of descent’; (6) Pratirūpa-caryā, ‘devotion of the duties of his caste’; and (7) Loka-pakti, ‘the perfecting of people’ (by teaching). 1. Respect paid to Brahmins.--The texts are full 18) E.g., Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā; xxv. 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 10, 6; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 1, 10; 3, 4, 6, etc. of references to the civilities to be paid to the Brahmin. He is styled bhagavant, 19) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 6, 1, 2. and is provided with good food 20) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xix. 12. and entertainment wherever he goes. Indeed, his sanctity exempts him from any close inquiry into his real claim to Brahminhood according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 21) vi. 5, 8; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvii. 2. 2. Gifts to Brahmins.--The Dānastuti (‘Praise of gifts’) is a recognized feature of the Rigveda, and the greed of the poets for Dakṣiṇās, or sacrificial fees, is notorious. Vedic texts 22) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiv. 5; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 2, 6, 7. themselves recognize that the literature thence resulting (Nārā śaṃsī) was often false to please the donors. It was, however, a rule 23) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 1, 25. Cf. also Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 15, 8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 3, 14, etc. that Brahmins should not accept what had been refused by others; this indicates a keen sense of the danger of cheapening their wares. So exclusively theirs was the right to receive gifts that the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 24) xiii. 7, 12. has to explain how Taranta and Purumīḷha became able to accept gifts by composing a Rigvedic hymn. 25) ix. 58, 3. The exaggerations in the celebration of the gifts bestowed on the priests has the curious result of giving us a series of numerals of some interest (Daśan). In some passages 26) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 12, 1. 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 6, etc. certain gifts--those of a horse or sheep--are forbidden, but this rule was not, it is clear, generally observed. 3. Immunities of Brahmins.--The Brahmin claimed to be exempt from the ordinary exercise of the royal power. When a king gives all his land and what is on it to the priests, the gift does not cover the property of the Brahmin according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 27) xiii. 5, 4, 29; 6, 2, 18; 7, 1, 13. The king censures all, but not the Brahmin, 28) Ibid., v. 4, 2, 3. nor can he safely oppress any Brahmin other than an ignorant priest. 29) Ibid., xiii. 4, 2, 17. An arbitrator (or a witness) must decide (or speak) for a Brahmin against a non-Brahmin in a legal dispute. 30) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 11, 9. The Brahmin's proper food is the Soma, 31) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 7, 2, 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 29. Cf. Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ix. 40; x. 18, etc. not Surā 32) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 8, 1,--5. or Parisrut, 33) Ibid., xii. 9, 1, 1. and he is forbidden to eat certain forms of flesh. 34) Ibid., 1, 2, 3, 9; vii. 5, 2, 37; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 8. On the other hand, he alone is allowed to eat the remains of the sacrifice, 35) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 1, 39; 5, 3, 16, etc. On the food of the Brahmins, cf. also Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, x. 4, 5; xvii. 1, 9; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 11. for no one else is sufficiently holy to consume food which the gods have eaten. Moreover, though he cannot be a physician, 36) Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 5, 8-14, where the Aśvins, who are famous as physicians (viii. 2, 1, 3; xii. 7, 1, 11). are treated as impure. he helps the physician by being beside him while he exercises his art. 37) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 4, 9, 3. Contrast Rv. x. 97, 22, where no discredit attaches to the profession. His wife 38) Av. v. 17. and his cow 39) Ibid., v. 18. are both sacred. 4. Legal Position of Brahmins.--The Taittirīya Saṃhitā 40) ii. 6, 10. 2. lays down a penalty of a hundred (the unit meant is unknown) for an insult to a Brahmin, and of a thousand for a blow; but if his blood is drawn, the penalty is a spiritual one. The only real murder is the slaying of a Brahmin according to the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa. 41) xiii. 3, 5, 3. The crime of slaying a Brahmin ranks above the sin of killing any other man, but below that of killing an embryo (bhrūṇa) in the Yajurveda; 42) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxi. 7; Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā, xlvii. 7; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 8, 12. the crime of slaying an embryo whose sex is uncertain is on a level with that of slaying a Brahmin. 43) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 10, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvii. 9; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 481; 10, 66. The murder of a Brahmin can be expiated only by the horse sacrifice, 44) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 1, 1; 5, 4, 1 et seq. or by a lesser rite in the late Taittirīya Āraṇyaka. 45) x. 38. The ritual slaying of a Brahmin is allowed in the later ceremonial, 46) Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 10, 10; 12, 16-20; Weber, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 18, 268, 269. and hinted at in the curious legend of Śunaḥśepa; 47) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 15; Sāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 20. and a Purohita might be punished with death for treachery to his master. 48) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 6, 8. 5. Purity of Birth.--The importance of pure descent is seen in the stress laid on being a descendant of a Ṛṣi (ārṣeya). 49) See Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 6, 1, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vii. 46; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 4, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 3, 4, 19; xii. 4, 4, 6. But, on the other hand, there are clear traces of another doctrine, which requires learning, and not physical descent, as the true criterion of Ṛṣihood. 50) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 6, 1, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxx. 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 8, 1. In agreement with this is the fact that Satyakāma Jābāla was received as a pupil, though his parentage was unknown, his mother being a slave girl who had been connected with several men, 51) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 4. and that in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 52) xi. 5, 4, 1; and cf. a citation in the scholiast on Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 6, 14; ‘Whoever studies the Stomabhāgas (a peculiarity of the Vasiṣṭhas) is a Vasiṣṭha’; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 73. the ceremony on acceptance as a pupil required merely the name of the pupil. So Kavaṣa is taunted in the Rigveda Brāhmaṇas 53) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 19; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xii. 3; Weber, op. cit., 2, 311. as being the son of a female slave (Dāsī), and Vatsa cleared himself of a similar imputation by a fire ordeal. 54) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 6, 6. Moreover, a very simple rite was adequate to remove doubts as to origin. 55) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 6, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxv. 3; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxiii. 4, 2. In these circumstances it is doubtful whether much value attaches to the Pravara lists in which the ancestors of the priest were invoked at the beginning of the sacrifice by the Hotṛ and the Adhvaryu priests. 56) See Weber, op. cit., 9, 321; 10, 8. 81; Max Müller. Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 380 et seq. Still, in many parts of the ritual the knowledge of two or more generations was needed, 57) Cf., e.g., Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 5, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiii. 5. and in one ceremony 58) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 5, 4; Weber, op. cit., 10, 85-88. ten ancestors who have drunk the Soma are required, but a literal performance of the rite is excused. Moreover, there are clear traces of ritual variations in schools, like those of the Vasiṣṭhas and the Viśvāmitras. 6. The Conduct of the Brahmin.--The Brahmin was required to maintain a fair standard of excellence. 59) Weber, 10, 88-96; Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 407 et seq. He was to be kind to all 60) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. ii. 3, 2, 12. and gentle, 61) Ibid., ii. 3, 4, 6. offering sacrifice and receiving gifts. 62) Ibid., xiii. 1, 5, 6. Especial stress was laid on purity of speech; 63) Ibid., iii. 2, 1, 24. Cf. iv. 1, 3, 17; Nirukta, xiii. 9; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiv. 5; xxxvii. 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 62. thus Viśvantara's excuse for excluding the Śyāparṇas from his retinue was their impure (apūtā) speech. 64) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 27; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 438. Theirs was the craving for knowledge 65) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 8, 8; v. 1, 1. and the life of begging. 66) Ibid., iii. 4, 1; iv. 4, 26. False Brahmins are those who do not fulfil their duties 67) Ibid., vi. 4, 4. (cf. Brahmabandhu) . But the penances for breach of duty are, in the Sūtras, of a very light and unimportant character. 68) Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 18, etc. 7. Brahminical Studies.--The aim of the priest is to obtain pre-eminence in sacred knowledge (brahma-varcasam), as is stated in numerous passages of Vedic literature. 69) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 7, 1; vii. 5, 18, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, Aśvamedha, v. 14; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 22; xxvii. 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 13, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 11, 6-9; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2, 6, 10; x. 3, 5, 16; xi. 4, 4, 1; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vi. 3, 5. Such distinction is not indeed confined to the Brahmin: the king has it also, but it is not really in a special manner appropriate to the Kṣatriya. 70) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 3, 6; xiii. 1, 5, 3, 5; 2, 6, 9. Many ritual acts are specified as leading to Brahmavarcasa, 71) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 7; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 1, 1; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxiii. 7, 3, etc.; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 1, 31, etc. but more stress is laid on the study of the sacred texts: the importance of such study is repeatedly insisted upon. 72) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 2, 3; xi. 3, 3, 3-6; 5, 7, 10. The technical name for study is Svādhyāya: the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa is eloquent upon its advantages, 73) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 6, 3, 9; 7, 1; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 13. and it is asserted that the joy of the learned Śrotriya, or ‘student,’ is equal to the highest joy possible. 74) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 3, 35-39; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ix. 8. Nāka Maudgalya held that study and the teaching of others were the true penance (tapas). 75) Ibid., vii. 8. 10. The object was the ‘threefold knowledge’ (trayī vidyā), that of the Ṛc, Yajus, and Sāman, 76) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 4, 2. 3; ii. 6, 4, 2-7; iv. 6, 7, 1, 2; v. 5, 5, 9; vi. 3, 1, 10. 11. 20; x. 5, 2, 1. 2; xi. 5, 4, 18; xii. 3, 3, 2, etc. a student of all three Vedas being called tri-śukriya 77) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 7. or tri-śukra, 78) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 1, 2. ‘thrice pure.’ Other objects of study are enumerated in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 79) xi. 5, 7, 5-8. in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, 80) ii. 9. 10. the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 81) vii. 1, 2, 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. etc. (See Itihāsa, Purāṇa; Gāthā, Nārāśaṃsī; Brahmodya; Anuśāsana, Anuvyākhyāna, Anvākhyāna, Kalpa, 2. Brāhmaṇa; Vidyā, Kṣatravidyā, Devajanavidyā, Nakṣatravidyā, Bhūtavidyā, Sarpavidyā; Atharvāṅgirasaḥ, Daiva, Nidhi, Pitrya, Rāśi; Sūtra, etc.) Directions as to the exact place and time of study are given in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 82) ii. 11. 12-15. and in the Sūtras. If study is carried on in the village, it is to be done silently (manasā); if outside, aloud (vācā). Learning is expected even from persons not normally competent as teachers, such as the Carakas, who are recognized in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 83) iv. 2, 4. 1. as possible sources of information. Here, too, may be mentioned the cases of Brahmins learning from princes, though their absolute value is doubtful, for the priests would naturally represent their patrons as interested in their sacred science: it is thus not necessary to see in these notices any real and independent study on the part of the Kṣatriyas. 84) Cf. (1) Kṣatriya and (2) Varṇa. Yājñavalkya learnt from Janaka, 85) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 6, 2, 5. Uddālaka Āruṇi and two other Brahmins from Pravāhaṇa Jaivali, 86) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 11; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 3, 1, and i. 8, 1. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5. 436, 514-516. Dṛptabālāki Gārgya from Ajātaśatru, 87) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upanisad, ii. 1, 1; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv. 1. and five Brahmins under the lead of Aruṇa from Aśvapati Kaikeya. 88) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 6, 1, 2. A few notices show the real educators of thought: wandering scholars went through the country 89) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 3, 1. Cf. iii. 7, 1. and engaged in disputes and discussions in which a prize was staked by the disputants. 90) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 4, 1, 1. Moreover, kings like Janaka offered rewards to the most learned of the Brahmins; 91) Ibid., xi. 6, 3, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 1-9, 20. 29. Ajātaśatru was jealous of his renown, and imitated his generosity. Again, learned women are several times mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas. 92) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 29; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, ii. 9; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 3, 1; 7, 1. Cf. Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 4, 4; Sāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 10. A special form of disputation was the Brahmodya, for which there was a regular place at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) 93) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 2, 11. and at the Daśarātra (‘ten-day festival’). 94) Ibid., iv. 6, 9, 20. The reward of learning was the gaining of the title of Kavi or Vipra, ‘sage.’ 95) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 9, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 3, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 2. 7; iii. 5, 3, 12. Cf. also Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upanisad, vi. 4, 29. 8. The Functions of the Brahmin.--The Brahmin was required not merely to practise individual culture, but also to give others the advantage of his skill, either as a teacher or as a sacrificial priest, or as a Purohita. As a teacher the Brahmin has, of course, the special duty of instructing his own son in both study and sacrificial ritual. 96) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 2, 4. The texts give examples of this, such as Āruṇi and Śvetaketu, 97) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 1. (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 2, 1 Kāṇva). or mythically Varuṇa and Bhṛgu. 98) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 6, 1, 1. This fact also appears from some of the names in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa 99) Indische Studien, 4, 376. of the Sāmaveda and the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka. 100) xv. 1. On the other hand, these Vaṃśas and the Vaṃśas of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa show that a father often preferred to let his son study under a famous teacher. The relation of pupil and teacher is described under Brahmacarya. A teacher might take several pupils, 101) Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, vii. 3. and he was bound to teach them with all his heart and soul. 102) See Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, vii. 4 (Indische Studien, 2, 211). He was bound to reveal everything to his pupil, at any rate to one who was staying with him for a year (saṃvatsara-vāsin), 103) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1, 1, 26. 27. Cf. Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v. 3, 3. an expression which shows, as was natural, that a pupil might easily change teachers. But, nevertheless, certain cases of learning kept secret and only revealed to special persons are enumerated. 104) So the Vasiṣṭhas and the Stomabhāgas, Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xv. 5, 24; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 2, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 17; Pravāhaṇa Jaivali and his knowledge of Brahman, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 11; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 3, where the claim is made that the praśāsana belongs to the Kṣatriyas. Śaṅkara, in his commentary, takes the word to mean the ‘giving of instruction,’ but this must be regarded as improbable, ‘rule’ being more probably the sense. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 128; Böhtlingk, Translation of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 8, 9. The exact times and modes of teaching are elaborately laid down in the Sūtras, 105) Rigveda Prātiśākhya, xv. 1 et seq.; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v. 3, 3; and see Weber, op. cit., 10, 129-135. but not in the earlier texts. As priest the Brahmin operated in all the greater sacrifices; the simple domestic (gṛhya) rites could normally be performed without his help, but not the more important rites (śrauta). The number varied: the ritual literature requires sixteen priests to be employed at the greatest sacrifices (see Ṛtvij), but other rites could be accomplished with four, 106) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 6, 1-4; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 4, 2. The four are the Hotṛ, Adhvaryu, Agnīdh, and Upavaktṛ: Weber, 10, 139, n. 4. five, 107) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, ix. 13; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 4, 2, with a second Adhvaryu, as well as the four enumerated in the previous note. six, 108) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, ix. 13; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 2, 3; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iii. 4, 6; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 7, 2, 6, where the list has Adhvaryu, Hotṛ, Brahman, with the Pratiprasthātṛ, Maitrāvaruṇa, Āgnīdhra. seven, 109) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, ix. 13; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 2, 5; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iii. 5; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 4, 2. The number seems to be made up of the five of note 107 and the Abhigarau--i.e., probably the Abhigara and the Apagara. or ten 110) Kāṭhaka Saṃhita, ix. 8, 13-16; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 4, 1; 3, 6, 4; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iii. 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 25; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 4, 2. What ten are meant is uncertain; the four of note 106 are enumerated. priests. Again, the Kauṣītakins 111) Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 4, 2, 19; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 37. had a seventeenth priest beside the usual sixteen, the Sadasya, so called because he watched the performance from the Sadas, ‘seat.’ In one rite, the Sattra (‘sacrificial session’) of the serpents, the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 112) xxv. 14, 3. adds three more to the sixteen, a second Unnetṛ, an Abhigara, and an Apagara. The later ritual places the Brahman at the head of all the priests, but this is probably not the early view (see Brahman). The sacrifice ensured, if properly performed, primarily the advantages of the sacrificer (yajamāna), 113) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 1, 20; 9, 1, 12; ii. 2, 2, 7; iii. 4, 2, 15; iv. 2, 5, 9, 10; viii. 5, 3, 8; ix. 5, 2, 16; xii. 8, 1, 17, etc. but the priest shared in the profit, besides securing the Dakṣiṇās. Disputes between sacrificers and the priests were not rare, as in the case of Viśvantara and the Śyāparṇas, 114) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 27 et seq.; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 436 et seq. or Janamejaya and the Asitamṛgas; 115) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 27. and the Aiṣāvīras are referred to as undersirable priests. 116) Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 2, 7, 32, where Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 153, n. 1, interprets Aiṣāvīra, not as a proper name, but as meaning ‘contemptible’; but Sāyaṇa thinks a proper name is meant, a view accepted by Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 45, n. 2. Moreover, Viśvāmitra once held the post of Purohita to Sudās, but gave place to Vasiṣṭha. The position of Purohita differed considerably from that of the ordinary priest, for the Purohita not merely might officiate at the sacrifice, but was the officiator in all the private sacrifices of his king. Hence he could, and undoubtedly sometimes did, obtain great influence over his master in matters of secular importance; and the power of the priesthood in political as opposed to domestic and religious matters, no doubt rested on the Purohita. There is no recognition in Vedic literature of the rule later prevailing by which, after spending part of his life as a Brahmacārin, and part as a householder, the Brahmin became an ascetic 117) See Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 372 et seq. (later divided into the two stages of Vānaprastha, ‘forest-dweller,’ and Saṃnyāsin, ‘mystic’). Yājñavalkya's case 118) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 4, 1; iv. 5, 1. See iii. 5, 1, for his teaching, of which his action is a logical consequence. shows that study of the Absolute might empty life of all its content for the sage, and drive him to abandon wife and family. In Buddhist times the same phenomenon is seen 119) Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 40 et seq.; Oldenberg, Buddha,^5 72 et seq. applying to other than Brahmins. The Buddhist texts are here confirmed in some degree by the Greek authorities. 120) Arrian, Indica, xii. 8. 9; Strabo, xv. 1, 49, 60. The practice bears a certain resemblance to the habit of kings, in the Epic tradition, 121) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 179 et seq. of retiring to the forest when active life is over. From the Greek authorities 122) See Fick, loc. cit. it also appears--what is certainly the case in the Buddhist literature 123) Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 57.<BR> --that Brahmins practised the most diverse occupations. It is difficult to say how far this was true for the Vedic period. The analogy of the Druids 124) Cæsar, Bellum Gallicum, vi. 14. The Druids did not fight, did not pay tribute, studied for many years, observed secrecy as to matters of ritual and learning, did not use writing, and had a certain belief in transmigration. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 19.<BR> --in some respects very close--suggests that the Brahmins may have been mainly confined to their professional tasks, including all the learned professions such as astronomy 125) Hence the Brahman is the 28th Nakṣatra: Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 3, 3; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 306, 311; Indische Studien, 10, 40. and so forth. This is not contradicted by any Vedic evidence, for instance, the poet of a hymn of the Rigveda 126) ix. 112. says he is a poet, his father a physician (Bhiṣaj), and his mother a grinder of corn (Upala-prakṣiṇī). This would seem to show that a Brahmin could be a doctor, while his wife would perform the ordinary household duties. So a Purohita could perhaps take the field to assist the king by prayer, as Viśvāmitra, 127) Rv. iii. 33. 53. and later on Vasiṣṭha 128) Rv. vii. 18. do, but this does not show that priests normally fought. Nor do they seem normally to have been agriculturists or merchants. On the other hand, they kept cattle: a Brahmacārin's duty was to watch his master's cattle. 129) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 4, 5; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 1, 6. It is therefore needless to suppose that they could not, and did not, on occasion turn to agricultural or mercantile pursuits, as they certainly did later. But it must be remembered that in all probability there was more purity of blood, and less pressure of life, among the Brahmins of the Vedic age than later in Buddhist times, when the Vedic sacrificial apparatus was falling into grave disrepute. It is clear that the Brahmins, whatever their defects, represented the intellectual side of Vedic life, and that the Kṣatriyas, if they played a part in that life, did so only in a secondary degree, and to a minor extent. It is natural to suppose that the Brahmins also composed ballads, the precursors of the epic; for though none such have survived, a few stanzas of this character, celebrating the generosity of patrons, have been preserved by being embedded in priestly compositions. A legend in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 130) i. 4, 1, 14-17. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 257, 277, 278, and Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 44. Almost all that can be said of the Brahmins is collected in Weber's Indische Studien, 10, 40-158. Cf. also Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 220-226; Fick, Die sociale Gliederung (for Buddhist times; the evidence is, however, of uncertain, and much of it probably of late, date); Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 82, 182, etc. (for notices of the Brahmins in the Epic): The Mutual Relations of the Four Castes according to the Mānavadharmacāstram (for the Dharma view). Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 248 et seq., discusses the priesthood in the Rigveda, and Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 197212, gives an excellent summary of the facts. shows clearly that the Brahmins regarded civilization as being spread by them only: Kosala and Videha, no doubt settled by Āryan tribes, are only rendered civilized and habitable by the influence of pious Brahmins. We need not doubt that the non-Brahminical tribes (see Vrātya) had attained intellectual as well as material civilization, but it is reasonable to assume that their civilization was inferior to that of the Brahmins, for the history of Hinduism is the conquest by the Brahmins--not by arms, but by mind--of the tribes Āryan and non-Āryan originally beyond the pale.

braahmaNa|ब्राह्मण
2. Brāhmaṇa, ‘religious explanation,’ 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 25, 15; iii. 45, 8; vi. 25, 1, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 9, 5; 5, 2, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 4, 1, etc. In the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa and the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, i. and ii., the use is constant. is the title of a class of books which as such are only mentioned in the Nirukta 2) ii. 16; xiii. 7. and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, 3) ii. 10. and then in the Sūtras, where the names of the Brāhmaṇas occur, showing that literary works were in existence.

braahmaNa|ब्राह्मण
3. Brāhmaṇa is taken by Roth in the St. Petersburg Dictionary 1) Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 253, n. 26. to mean the ‘Soma cup of the Brahman’ in two passages of the Rigveda 2) i. 15, 5; ii. 36, 5. and one of the Atharvaveda. 3) xx. 2, 3.

braahmaNaachChaMsin|ब्राह्मणाच्छंसिन्
ब्राह्मणाच्-छंसिन्<BR> (‘reciting after the Brāhmaṇa--i.e., Brahman’) is the name of a priest in the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 4, 2; 6, 3. 4; 10, 1; 18, 5; vii. 1, 2; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxviii. 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 6, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 2, 3, 13, etc. In the technical division of the sacrificial priests (Ṛtvij) he is classed with the Brahman, 2) Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 144. but it is clear that he was really a Hotraka or assistant of the Hotṛ. 3) E.g., Āśvalāyana Srauta Sūtra, v. 10, 10; Weber, op. cit., 9, 374-376. According to Oldenberg, 4) Religion des Veda, 396. he was known to the Rigveda as Brahman. This is denied by Geldner, 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 145 et seq. Cf. Purohita. who sees in Brahman merely the ‘superintending priest’ or the ‘priest.’ 

bleShka|ब्लेष्क
ब्लेष्क<BR> in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 1) xxiii. 6; xxxvii. 13. 14. denotes a rope or noose for strangling. It is spelt Vleṣka in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā. 2) iii. 6, 10. In Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, x. 19, 1, meṣka is read. BH.

bhaga|भग
भग<BR> denotes a part of the chariot in one passage of the Rigveda 1) ii. 34, 8. according to Hillebrandt. 2) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 95.

bhaginii|भगिनी
भगिनी,<BR> ‘sister,’ literally the ‘fortunate one’ in so far as she has a brother, occurs in the Nirukta (iii. 6).

bhagiirathaaixvaaka|भगीरथऐक्ष्वाक
भगी-रथ ऐक्ष्वाक<BR> (‘descendant of Ikṣvāku’) is the name of a king in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iv. 6, 1. 2). It is important to note that he is regarded as being on friendly terms with the Kuru-Pañcālas, which points to the Ikṣvākus being allied to that people, and not belonging (as is the case in the Buddhist books) to the east of India.

bhanga|भङ्ग
भङ्ग,<BR> ‘hemp,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda. 1) xi. 6, 15; conceivably in Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 14, but not probably. In the Rigveda 2) ix. 61, 13. it is an epithet of Soma, presumably 3) Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 299. in the sense of ‘intoxicating,’ which then came to designate hemp. 4) Hence the modern ‘Bang’ or Bhang,’ an intoxicant made from the dried leaves and small stalks of hemp, taken either by smoking or by eating when mixed up into a sweetmeat. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 68; Grierson, Indian Antiquary, 23, 260; Yule and Burnell, Hobson-Jobson, s.v. Bang.

bhangaashvina|भङ्गाश्विन
भङ्गाश्विन<BR> is the name of the father of Ṛtuparna in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra. 1) xx. 12. In the Mahābhārata 2) iii. 2745. he is called Bhāṅgāsuri. In the Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra 3) xxi. 20; Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 57, 745. mention is made of Ṛtuparṇa-Kayovadhī as the Bhaṅgyaśvinau. 

bhangyashravas|भङ्ग्यश्रवस्
भङ्ग्य-श्रवस्<BR> is the name of a man in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka. 1) Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 78.

bhajeratha|भजेरथ
भजे-रथ<BR> is mentioned in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 60, 2. where Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138, 165. thinks a place-name is meant. Griffith 3) Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 463. is doubtful whether the word is the name of a place or a man. Roth 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. was inclined to see a corruption of the text. 5) Grassmann, Wörterbuch, s.v., thinks that the compound should be read as two words: bhaje rathasya (satpatim), ‘to win (the lord) of the car.’ Cf. Bhagīratha.

bhadrapadaa|भद्रपदा
भद्र-पदा<BR> See Nakṣatra.

bhadrasenaaajaatashatrava|भद्रसेनआजातशत्रव
भद्र-सेन आजातशत्रव<BR> (‘descendant of Ajātaśatru’) is the name of a man, presumably a prince, whom Uddālaka is said in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (v. 5, 5, 14) to have bewitched.

bhayadaaasamaatya|भयदआसमात्य
भय-द आसमात्य<BR> (‘descendant of Asamāti’) is the name of a king in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 1) iv. 8, 7. Oertel, 2) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 247. however, seems to take the name as Abhayada, but this is not probable, for Bhayada is a name in the Purāṇas.

bhayamaana|भयमान
भयमान<BR> is, according to Sāyaṇa, the name of a man in one hymn of the Rigveda, 1) i. 100, 17. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 266. which is ascribed by the Anukramaṇī (Index) to his authorship. The interpretation is, however, uncertain.

bharata|भरत
भरत<BR> is the name of a people of great importance in the Rigveda and the later literature. In the Rigveda they appear prominently in the third and seventh Maṇḍalas in connexion with Sudās and the Tṛtsus, 1) iii. 53, 9. 12, 24; 33, 11, 12 (Viśvā mitra, who is accordingly hailed as Bharata-ṛṣabha, ‘bull of the Bharatas,’ in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 17, 7); vii. 8, 4; 33, 6, in which passage a defeat of the Bharatas, and their rescue by the aid of Vasiṣṭha, is clearly referred to; not, as was formerly thought (e.g., Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 354; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 127), a defeat of the Bharatas by the Tṛtsus. while in the sixth Maṇḍala they are associated with Divodāsa. 2) vi. 16, 4. 5. Cf. verse 19. In one passage 3) vii. 8, 4. the Bharatas are, like the Tṛtsus, enemies of the Pūrus: there can be little doubt that Ludwig's view of the identity of the Bharatas and and Tṛtsus is practically correct. More precisely Oldenberg 5) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 207. In Buddha, 405 et seq., he accepted the identification of Ludwig. considers that the Tṛtsus are the Vasiṣṭhas, the family singers of the Bharatas; while Geldner 6) Vedische Studien, 2, 136 et seq. recognizes, with perhaps more probability, in the Tṛtsus the royal family of the Bharatas. That the Tṛtsus and Bharatas were enemies, as Zimmer 7) Altindisches Leben, 127. This is also Bloomfield's view (see Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 41, 42). holds, is most improbable even on geographical grounds, for the Tṛtsus in Zimmer's view 8) Op. cit., 124. occupied the country to the east of the Paruṣṇī (Ravi), and the Bharatas must therefore be regarded as coming against the Tṛtsus from the west, whereas the Rigveda 9) iii. 23, 4: in verse 2 Devasravas and Devavāta are mentioned as Bhāratas, Oldenberg, Buddha, 410, n., mentions that in the Mahābhārata, iii. 6065, a tributary of the Sarasvatī is called Kauśikī, and the Kuśikas are, of course, the family of Viśvāmitra, whose connexion with the Bharatas is beyond question. recognizes two Bharata chiefs on the Sarasvatī, Āpayā, and Dṛṣadvatī--that is, in the holy land of India, the Madhyadeśa. Hillebrandt 10) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 111. His view is that Sudās and the Bharatas were later comers than the Tṛtsus, who joined them as one people, the Vasiṣṭhas becoming the priests of the Bharatas. He suggests that the Vasiṣṭhas were not originally adherents of the IndraSoma cult, but were specially devoted to the Varuṇa cult; but there is no decisive evidence for either suggestion. Cf. Bloomfield, as cited in n. 7. sees in the connexion of the Tṛtsus and the Bharatas a fusion of two tribes; but this is not supported by any evidence beyond the fact that in his opinion some such theory is needed to explain Divodāsa's appearing in connexion with the Bharadvāja family, while Sudās, his son, ^4 Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 172 et seq. or perhaps grandson (cf. Pijavana), is connected with the Vasiṣṭhas and the Viśvāmitras. In the later literature the Bharatas appear as especially famous. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11) xiii. 5, 4. mentions Bharata Dauḥṣanti as a king, sacrificer of the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) and Śatānīka Sātrājita, as another Bharata who offered that sacrifice. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 12) viii. 23 and 21. mentions Bharata Dauḥṣanti as receiving the kingly coronation from Dīrghatamas Māmateya, and Śatānīka as being consecrated by Somaśuṣman Vājaratnāyana, a priest whose name is of quite late origin. The geographical position of the Bharata people is clearly shown by the fact that the Bharata kings win victories over the Kāśis, and make offerings on the Yamunā (Jumna) and Gaṅgā (Ganges). 13) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 11. 21. Moreover, in the formula of the king's proclamation for the people, the variants recorded 14) In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 10, 2, and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 4, 2, the phrase is eṣa vo, Bharatā, rājā; the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, in the Kāṇva recension, xi. 3, 3; 6, 3, has Kuravaḥ, Pañcālāḥ (evidently as a joint people); Āpastamba, xviii. 12, 7, gives Bharatāḥ, Kuravaḥ, Pañcālāḥ, Kuru-Pañcālāḥ, and janatāḥ, as alternatives, according to the people to whom the king belongs; the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 7, and the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 7, read esa te janate rājā. See Weber, Indian Literature, 114, n.; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 465. include Kuravaḥ, Pañcālāḥ, Kuru-Pañcālāḥ, and Bharatāḥ; and the Mahābhārata consistently recognizes the royal family of the Kurus as a Bharata family. 15) Oldenberg, Buddha, 409. It is therefore extremely probable that Oldenberg 16) Op. cit., 408. He points out (409, n.) that in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, only the Kuru king. Janamejaya, and the Bharata kings are mentioned without specification of the peoples over whom they ruled. is right in holding that the Bharatas in the times of the Brāhmaṇas were merging in the Kuru-Pañcāla people. The ritual practices of the Bharatas are repeatedly mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 17) xiv. 3, 13; xv. 5, 24, and perhaps xviii. 10, 8, on which see Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 28, n. 2; below, p. 98. the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 18) ii. 25; iii. 18. The sense ‘mercenary soldier,’ here seen by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2 (no longer mentioned in the Dictionary of Böhtlingk), cannot be accepted. See Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 254; Oldenberg, Buddha, 407, n. On the other hand, there is no mention of the Bharatas in the geographical lists of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 14). in the Mānava Dharma Śāstra, or in the Buddhist texts. This means that the Bharatas were no longer a people, but a family or sub-tribe in a larger people. the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 19) v. 4, 4, 1. and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka. 20) i. 27, 2. Already in the Rigveda 21) ii. 7, 1. 5; iv. 25, 4; vi. 16, 19; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 9, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 2, 2. Roth thinks this epithet of Agni perhaps means ‘warlike,’ but this is unlikely. there is mention made of Agni Bhārata (‘of the Bharatas’). In the Āprī hymns 22) Rv. i. 22, 10; 142, 9; 188, 8; ii. 1, 11; 3, 8; iii. 4, 8, etc. occurs a goddess Bhāratī, the personified divine protective power of the Bharatas: her association in the hymns with Sarasvatī reflects the connexion of the Bharatas with the Sarasvatī in the Rigveda. 9) iii. 23, 4: in verse 2 Devasravas and Devavāta are mentioned as Bhāratas, Oldenberg, Buddha, 410, n., mentions that in the Mahābhārata, iii. 6065, a tributary of the Sarasvatī is called Kauśikī, and the Kuśikas are, of course, the family of Viśvāmitra, whose connexion with the Bharatas is beyond question. Again, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 23) i. 4, 2, 2. Agni is referred to as brāhmaṇa Bhārata, ‘priest of the Bharatas,’ and is invited to dispose of the offering Manuṣvat Bharatavat, ‘like Manu,’ ‘like Bharata.’ 24) i. 5, 1, 7. In one or two passages 25) i. 112, 14; vii. 19, 8. Sudās or Divodāsa and, on the other hand, Purukutsa or Trasadasyu appear in a friendly relation. Possibly this points, as Oldenberg 26) Op. cit., 410. suggests, to the union of Bharatas and Pūrus with the Kurus. A Bharata is referred to in the fifth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda: 27) v. 54, 14. For a later legend of Bharata, cf. Leumann, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 80 et seq.; von Bradke, ibid., 498-503; and see Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 13, 338, 340, etc. who he was is uncertain.

bharadvaaja|भरद्वाज
भरद्-वाज<BR> is the name of the reputed 1) Cf. Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 4, 2; Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 10; Bṛhaddevatā, v. 102 et seq., where he is said to be a son of Bṛhaspati, and a grandson of Aṅgiras (cf. Rv. vi. 2, 10; 11, 3, etc.); Arnold, Vedic Metre, 61, 62. author of the sixth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda. The attribution is so far correct that Bharadvāja 2) Rv. vi. 15, 3; 16, 5. 33; 17, 4; 31, 4; 48, 7. 13; 63, 10; 65, 6. See also Rv. i. 112, 13; 116, 18; x. 150, 5; 181, 2. and the Bharadvājas 3) Rv. vi. 10, 6; 16, 33; 17, 14; 23, 10; 25, 9; 35, 4; 47, 25; 59, 15. See also Rv. i. 59, 7. are repeatedly mentioned as singers in that Maṇḍala. Judging by the tone of the references to Bharadvāja, he can hardly be deemed to have been a contemporary of any of the hymns. 4) Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 210 212. According to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 5) xv. 3, 7. he was the Purohita of Divodāsa. This interpretation is to be preferred to that of Roth, 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. See Rv. i. 116, 18; vi. 16, 5; 31, 4. who suggests that he and Divodāsa were identical. His connexion with the house of Divodāsa also appears from the statement of the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 7) xxi. 10 (Indische Studien, 3, 478). that Bharadvāja gave Pratardana the kingdom. It is unnecessary to suppose that the same Bharadvāja was meant in both cases, and that Pratardana was a son of Divodāsa: the later Saṃhitās refer to Bharadvāja, like the other great sages, irrespective of chronology. The Bharadvājas in their poems mention Bṛbu, Bṛsaya, and the Pārāvatas. 8) vi. 61, 1-3. Hillebrandt 9) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 104. has pointed out that they are also connected with the Sṛñjayas. In particular, the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 10) xvi. 11, 11. mentions that Bharadvāja gained largesse from Prastoka Sārñjaya and Bṛbu. But it is very doubtful if it is correct to place all these people and Divodāsa in Arachosia and Drangiana. Bharadvāja as an author and a seer is frequently referred to in the later Saṃhitās 11) Av. ii. 12, 2; iv. 29, 5; xviii. 3, 16; xix. 48, 6; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvi. 19; xx. 9; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 7, 19; iv. 8, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 55, etc. and the Brāhmaṇas. 12) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 18; viii. 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 11, 13; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, i. 2, 2; 4, 2; ii. 2, 2. 4, etc.; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xv. 1; xxix. 3; xxx. 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 128; Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 31.

bharant|bharat|भरत्|भरन्त्
भरन्त्,<BR> ‘bearing,’ in the plural denotes in one passage of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 1) xviii. 10, 8. according to Böhtlingk, 2) Dictionary, s.v. following Sāyaṇa, ‘the warrior caste,’ but the sense is not certain. Weber 3) Indische Studien, 10, 28, n. 2. Cf. Bharata, n. 17. was inclined to see a reference to the Bharatas, though the form of the word is that of the present participle. 4) Bharatām, interpreted by Sāyaṇa as bharaṇaṃ kurvatām kṣatriyāṇām.

bharuujii|भरूजी
भरूजी<BR> in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 24. 8. may denote, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. a noxious animal. 

bhartR|भर्तृ
भर्तृ,<BR> besides having the literal sense of ‘bearer,’ means ‘supporter’ or ‘master’ in the older literature; 1) Av. xi. 7, 15; xviii. 2, 30; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 4, 7 (where ‘husband’ is possible); iv. 6, 7, 21, etc. but it is doubtful whether the sense of ‘husband’ is ever found there. In one passage of the Rigveda 2) v. 58, 7. ‘husband’ is certainly the most natural sense, but, as Delbrück 3) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 415, n. 1. correctly remarks, even there ‘father’ may be meant, since ‘mother’ is here and there 4) Av. v. 5, 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 1, 4. called Bhartrī.

bhalaanas|भलानस्
भलानस्,<BR> plural, is the name in the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 7. of one of the five tribes, Pakthas, Bhalānases, Alinas, Viṣāṇins, and Śivas, who are mentioned as ranged on the side 2) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 260, 261, who takes the form of the name to be Bhalāna (but the text of the Rv. has bhalāna¤saḥ), and who overlooks Zimmer's later view. of the enemies of Sudās in the battle of the ten kings (Dāśarājña), not opposed to them, as Roth, 3) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 95. and at one time Zimmer, 4) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 126. thought. Zimmer 5) Op. cit., 431. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173, 207. suggests as their original home East Kabulistan, comparing the name of the Bolan pass. This seems a reasonably probable view.

bhavatraatashaayasthi|भवत्रातशायस्थि
भव-त्रात शायस्थि<BR> is the name of a teacher in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372; Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 443.

What his functions exactly were is uncertain. Sāyaṇa in some places 3) On Taittirīya Saṃhitā and Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit., and on Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 1, 9. renders the word by ‘tax-collector’ but in others 4) On Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 17. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 63, n. as ‘carver,’ thus making this functionary either a revenue officer or a mere court official.

bhaaryaa|भार्या
भार्या,<BR> later a common expression for ‘wife,’ does not occur in that sense at all in the Saṃhitās. It first appears, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 1) vii. 9. 8. where, however, Delbrück 2) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 415. Cf. Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 29, 20. suggests that merely a member of the household (‘who is to be maintained’) may be meant. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 3) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 4, 1; iv. 5, 1. however, the two wives of Yājñavalkya are so designated.

bhaallavin|भाल्लविन्
भाल्लविन्,<BR> ‘pupil of Bhallavin,’ is the name of a school of teachers mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 1) ii. 4, 7 (spelt Bhāllabin). Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 44; 2, 100; 390; Nidāna Sūtra, v. 1; Anupada Sūtra, ii. 1; vii. 12; Bṛhaddevatā v. 23. 159.

bhaavayavya|भावयव्य
भावयव्य<BR> See Bhāvya.

bhaavya|भाव्य
भाव्य<BR> is the name of a patron, as it seems, in the Rigveda. 1) i. 126, 1; Nirukta, ix. 10. In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 2) xvi. 11, 5. Cf. Bṛhaddevatā, iii. 140. the form given is Bhāvayavya, being a patronymic of Svanaya, who is the patron of Kakṣīvant. This combination is borne out by the Rigveda, where Kakṣīvant and Svanaya are mentioned in the same verse, 3) i. 126, 3. while Svanaya must be meant in the verse of the same hymn, 4) i. 126, 1. where Bhāvya is mentioned as ‘living on the Sindhu’ (Indus). Roth's 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1 f. view that Bhāvya here is perhaps a gerundive meaning to be ‘reverenced’ is not probable. Ludwig 6) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 151. Cf. Weber, Episches im Vedischen Ritual, 22; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 128. thinks Svanaya was connected with the Nahuṣas.

bhaaShaa|भाषा
भाषा<BR> in the Nirukta 1) i. 4, 5. Cf. ii. 2. and Pāṇini 2) iii. 2, 108; vi. 1, 181. Cf. Franke, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, 17, 54 et seq., who distinguishes the Bhāṣā as the speech of conversational use from the language regulated by Pāṇini's rules. But see Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 1, xliv; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 179, 180. denotes the ordinary speech of the day as opposed to Vedic language. Cf. Vāc.

bhaasa|भास
भास<BR> is the name of a bird of prey in the Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa, 1) vi. 8, See Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 40. and often in the Epic. 

bhixaa|भिक्षा
भिक्षा,<BR> ‘begging,’ is one of the duties of the Brahmacārin according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) xi. 3, 3, 7. Cf. a Mantra in Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 9, etc.; and bhikṣācarya, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 4, 1; iv. 4, 26. The word has also the sense of ‘alms,’ as that which is obtained by begging, in the Atharvaveda. 2) xi. 5, 9. According to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, 3) s.v. 2. it has this sense in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 4) viii. 8, 5, where the scholiast explains the word by ‘perfumes, garlands, food,’ etc. (gandhamālyānnādi). also, but the correct reading there is probably Āmikṣā.

bhixu|भिक्षु
भिक्षु,<BR> ‘beggar,’ is a term not found in Vedic literature. The begging of the Brahmacārin is quite a different thing from the duties of the Bhikṣu in the later system of the Āśramas (religious stages of life), when the Brahmin in the last stage of his life, after leaving his home and family, lives on alms alone. See 1. Brāhmaṇa.

bhitti|भित्ति
भित्ति<BR> in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) iii. 5, 3, 9. Cf. Sāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, viii. 3, 24. denotes a mat made of split reeds.

bhiShaj|भिषज्
भिषज्,<BR> ‘physician,’ is a word of common occurrence in the Rigveda 1) ii. 33, 4; vi. 50, 7; ix. 112, 1; bheṣaja, adjective, ii. 33, 7; x. 137, 6; substantive, i. 23, 19. 20; ii. 33, 2. 4; vi. 74, 3; vii. 46, 3, etc. and later. 2) Av. v. 29, 1; vi. 24, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 4, 9, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 5; xix. 12. 88; xxx. 10, etc.; bheṣaja, adjective, Av. vi. 109, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 45, etc.; substantive, Av. v. 29, 1; vi. 21, 2; xi. 1, 9, etc. There is no trace whatever in the former text of the profession being held in disrepute: the Aśvins, 3) Rv. i. 116, 16; 157, 6; viii. 18, 8; 86, 1; x. 39, 3. 5; Av. vii. 53, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 18. Varuṇa, 4) See Rv. i. 24, 9. and Rudra 5) Rv. ii. 33, 4. 7. are all called physicians. On the other hand, in the Dharma literature 6) See Āpastamba Dharma Sūtra, i. 6, 18, 20; 19, 15; Gautama Dharma Sūtra, xvii. 17; Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, xiv. 2, 19; Viṣṇu, li. 10; lxxxii. 9; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 1. this profession is utterly despised. This dislike is found as early as the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 7) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 4, 9, 3. Cf. Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 6, 2; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 5, 14; Bloomfield, op. cit., xxxix, xl. where the Aśvins are condemned because of their having to do with the practice of medicine (bheṣaja), on the ground that it brings them too much among men, an allusion to the caste dislike of promiscuous contact. The Rigveda 8) x. 97. contains a hymn in which a physician celebrates his plants and their healing powers. Moreover, wonderful cures are referred to as performed by the Aśvins: the healing of the lame 9) Rv. i. 112, 8; x. 39, 3, etc. and of the blind; 10) Cf. the case of Ṛjrāśva, Rv. i. 116, 17. the rejuvenation of the aged Cyavana 11) Rv. x. 39, 4. and of Puraṃdhi's husband; 12) i. 116, 13. the giving of an iron leg (jaṅghā āyasī) to Viśpalā, 13) Rv. i. 116, 15, etc. a deed only more wonderful if we assume that Viśpalā was a mare, as has been suggested by Pischel. 14) Vedische Studien, 1, 171 et seq.; 305. It would in all probability be a mistake to assume 15) As Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 398, is inclined to do. that the Vedic Indians had any surgical skill: they no doubt applied simples to wounds, 16) Cf. Rv. ix. 112, 1. but both their medicien and their surgery must have been most primitive. All that the Atharvaveda shows in regard to medicine is the use of herbs combined with spells, 17) So it is said in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xii. 9, 10: bheṣajaṃ vā Ātharvaṇāni, ‘the Atharvan hymns are medicine’; xvi. 10, 10; and cf. ibid., xxiii. 16, 7; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 5 and 2. Bhiṣaj. and of water (cf. Jalāṣa), remedies Indo-European in character, but not of much scientific value. On the other hand, the knowledge of anatomy shown (see Śarīra), though betraying grave inaccuracies, is not altogether insignificant; but that was due no doubt mainly to the practice of dissecting animals at the sacrifice. There is some evidence in the Rigveda 18) ix. 112, where a profession must be meant. Ibid., 3, refers to the fees of the physician. Cf. also x. 97, 4. 8. that the practice of medicine was already a profession; this is supported by the inclusion of a physician in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 19) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 10; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 4, 1. According to Bloomfield, 20) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 456. a hymn of the Atharvaveda 21) v. 30, 5. But this sense is doubtful. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 277. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 397-399; Bloomfield, op. cit., passim (see references on p. 697); Atharvaveda, 59 et seq.; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 420 et seq.; Jolly, Medicin, 16, 17; Winternitz, Nature, 1898, 233-235; Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, passim. contains a physician's deprecation of the use of home-made remedies instead of reliance on his professional training.

bhiShajaatharvaNa|भिषजाथर्वण
2. Bhiṣaj Ātharvaṇa is the name of a mythic physician mentioned in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 1) xvi. 3 (Indische Studien, 3, 459). Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xxi; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 181.

bhiimavaidarbha|भीमवैदर्भ
भीम वैदर्भ<BR> (‘prince of Vidarbha’) is mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (vii. 34) as having received instruction regarding the substitute for the Soma juice, through a succession of teachers, from Parvata and Nārada.

bhiimasena|भीमसेन
भीम-सेन<BR> is the name of one of the brothers of Janamejaya, the Pārikṣitīyas, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) xiii. 5, 4, 3. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xvi. 9, 3.

bhujyu|भुज्यु
1. Bhujyu denotes, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, an ‘adder’ in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) iv. 27, 4; x. 95, 8. and one of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 2) xviii. 42. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 126, who takes bhujyu in Rv. x. 95, 8, as meaning ‘ardent,’ ‘rutting.’ But the sense is uncertain in all these passages.

bhujyu|भुज्यु
2. Bhujyu is the name of a man, son of Tugra, who is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 112, 6, 20; 116, 3; 117, 14; 119, 4; vi. 62, 6; vii. 68, 7; 69, 7; x. 40, 7; 65, 12; 143, 5. as saved from the deep by the Aśvins. According to Bühler, 2) Indische Palœographie, 17. Cf. Baunack, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 35, 485; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 214; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 16, n. 5; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 244, 245; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 52. the passages refer to Bhujyu being saved from shipwreck during a voyage in the Indian Ocean, but the evidence is inadequate to support this conclusion. Cf. Samudra.

bhujyulaahyaayani|भुज्युलाह्यायनि
भुज्यु लाह्यायनि<BR> (‘descendant of Lahyāyana’) is the name of a teacher, a contemporary of Yājñavalkya, in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (iii. 3, 1).

bhurij|भुरिज्
भुरिज्<BR> (used in the dual only) is a word of somewhat doubtful sense. Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 466. regarded it as meaning in some passages 2) Rv. viii. 4, 16; Av. xx. 127, 4. ‘scissors,’ and in others 3) Rv. iv. 2, 14; ix. 26, 4; 71, 5. where Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 239243, considers that the shafts of the chariot are meant (cf. Gobhila Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 4, 31, whence it appears that the chariot-pole, spoken of as having two arms, was forked). The same view regarding the passages cited in n. 2 gives the sense of a stropping apparatus, consisting of two pieces of wood, between which a grindstone moves. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 252, 255. an apparatus consisting of two arms used by the chariot-maker for fixing the wood at which he worked, being of the nature of a carpenter's vice. See also Ksura

bhuutavidyaa|भूतविद्या
भूत-विद्या<BR> is one of the sciences enumerated in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 1) vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. Cf. Little, Grammatical Index, 115. It seems to mean the ‘science of creatures’ that trouble men, and of the means of warding them off, ‘demonology.’

bhuutaviira|भूतवीर
भूत-वीर<BR> is the name of a family of priests who, according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 1) vii. 27. Cf. Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 118; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 344, n. 3; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 437 et seq. were employed by Janamejaya to the exclusion of the Kaśyapas. A family of the latter, the Asitamṛgas, however, won back the favour of Janamejaya, and ousted the Bhūtavīras. 

bhuutaaMsha|भूतांश
भूतांश<BR> is in the Rigveda 1) x. 106, 11. See Nirukta, xii, 41; Bṛhaddevatā. viii. 18. 19; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 133. the name of a poet, a descendant of Kaśyapa.

bhuuti|भूति
भूति<BR> is the term used in the Rigveda 1) viii. 59, 7. Cf. i. 161, 1 (both late passages). and later 2) Av. ix. 6, 45; x. 3, 17; 6, 9; xi. 7, 22; 8, 21; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 1, 1; 3, 5, etc.; bhūti-kāma, ‘desiring prosperity,’ Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 1, 1; 2, 3, 3; v. 1, 9, 1, etc. for ‘prosperity.’

bhuumi|भूमि
भूमि<BR> or Bhūmī is a common word for ‘earth’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 64, 5; 161, 14; ii. 14, 7, etc. So in x. 18, 10, ‘mother earth’ receives the remains of the dead. and later, 2) Av. vi. 2, 1, where it is said that the Bhūmi is the highest of the three earths (Pṛthivī); xi. 7, 14, where nine earths and seas are mentioned; ii. 9, 4; vi. 8, 2, etc. being practically a synonym of Pṛthivī. It is also used of the land given by the god to the Āryan, 3) Rv. iv. 26, 2. Cf. vi. 47, 20. and of grants of land. 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 24; 6, 2, 18.

bhuumidundubhi|भूमिदुन्दुभि
भूमि-दुन्दुभि,<BR> ‘earth drum,’ denotes a pit covered with a hide used at the Mahāvrata rite, and mentioned in the Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 9, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 5. and the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 19; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v. 1, 5. Cf. Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 277, n. 14.

bhuumipaasha|भूमिपाश
भूमि-पाश,<BR> ‘earth net,’ is the name of a plant in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, probably some sort of creeper. ^1 xiii. 8, 1, 16. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 427, n. 1.

bhRgavaaNa|भृगवाण
भृगवाण<BR> is found in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 120, 5. apparently 2) Pischel, Vedische Studien, i. 4; 2, 92. as a name of a man who is called Śobha. Ludwig, 3) U7ber Methode bei Interpretation, 4. however, thinks that his name was Ghoṣa. Elsewhere the word appears as an epithet of Agni, doubtless in allusion to his cult by the Bhṛgus. 

bhRgu|भृगु
भृगु<BR> is a sage of almost entirely mythical character in the Rigveda and later. He counts as a son of Varuṇa, 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 6, 1, 1; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ix. 1. Cf. Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xviii. 9, 2; Nirukta, iii. 17. bearing the patronymic Vāruṇi. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 34, and n. 14. For a different form of the legend, cf. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 2, 5. In the plural the Bhṛgus are repeatedly 3) Rv. i. 58, 6; 127, 7; 143, 4; ii. 4, 2; iii. 2, 4; iv. 7, 1, etc. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 51. The legend of their chariot-making (Rv. iv. 16, 20; x. 39, 14) may be due, as Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., suggests, to a confusion with the Ṛbhus. It may, however, be an allusion to the historic Bhṛgus, whom we find in the battle of the ten kings. alluded to as devoted to the fire cult. They are clearly 4) As shown by the legend of fire having been brought to them by Mātariśvan, Rv. iii. 5, 10. no more than a group of ancient priests and ancestors with an eponymous Bhṛgu 5) i. 60, 1, where, however, Roth, loc. cit., takes the singular in a collective sense, an interpretation which may be correct, but is not necessary. in the Rigveda, except in three passages, 6) Rv. vii. 18, 6; viii. 3, 9; 6, 18, to which list, given by Macdonell, loc. cit., Roth adds viii. 102, 4, Aurva-Bhṛgu-vat, ‘like Aurva and Bhṛgu.’ Cf. the fact that the Aurvas, in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 33, take the place of the Bhṛgus of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxx. 5. where they are evidently regarded as an historic family. It is not clear, however, whether they were priests or warriors: in the battle of the ten kings the Bhṛgus appear with the Druhyus, perhaps as their priests, but this is not certain. 7) In viii. 3, 9; 6, 18; 102, 4, the reference to a priestly family is the more natural; in vii. 18, 6, warriors may be meant. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 262, n., where he cites ix. 101, 13, as perhaps denoting the same thing. In the later literature the Bhṛgus are a real family, with subdivisions like the Aitaśāyana, according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa. 8) xxx. 5. See n. 6. The Bhṛgus are mentioned as priests in connexion with various rites, such as the Agnisthāpana 9) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 6, 5, 2; v. 6, 8, 6; Av. iv. 14, 5; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 4, 1 (p. 48). and the Daśapeyakratu. 10) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 18; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 2, 5; Pañcavimśa Brāhmaṇa, xviii. 9, 2. In many passages they are conjoined with the Aṅgirases. 11) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 1, 7, 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 1, 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 18; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 4, 8; iii. 2, 7, 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 1, 13, etc. Cf. Rv. viii. 35, 3; 43, 13; x. 14, 6, in the first and last of which passages the Atharvans also occur. See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xxvii. n. 2. Hence, in the Atharvanic ritual texts, the term Bhṛgvaṅgirasaḥ is applied to the Atharvaveda (Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 9, 10, 107 et seq.). the close association of the two families is shown by the fact that Cyavana is called either a Bhārgava or an Āṅgirasa in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 12) iv. 1, 5, 1. In the Atharvaveda 13) v. 19, 1. the name of Bhṛgu is selected to exemplify the dangers incurred by the oppressors of Brahmans: the Sṛñjaya Vaitahavyas perish in consequence of an attack on Bhṛgu. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 14) ii. 20. In the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 42-44 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 204), Bhṛgu Vāruṇi appears as a student. Cf. Taittirīya Upaniṣad, iii. 1. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 169-173; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 140; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 443 et seq. also Bhṛgu has this representative character. Cf. Bhṛgavāṇa and Bhārgava.

bhRngaa|भृङ्गा
भृङ्गा<BR> is the name of a species of bee, later specified as large and black, in the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 2, 22. and the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 29. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 96. which include it in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’).

bhRmyashva|भृम्यश्व
भृम्य्-अश्व<BR> is the name of the father of Mudgala in the Nirukta (ix. 24).

bhekuri|भेकुरि
भेकुरि<BR> See Bekurā.

bheda|भेद
1. Bheda, one of the enemies of Sudās and the TṛtsuBharatas, was defeated by the former in the Yamunā (Jumna), 1) Rv. vii. 18, 18. 19; 33, 3; 83, 4. apparently in a second conflict fought after the battle of the ten kings, in which Sudās successfully defended his western frontier against the confederate foes. The Ajas, Śigrus, and Yakṣus, who are mentioned as also defeated, may have been united under his leadership if he was a king; or the Bhedas may have been a separate people, as Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 12 (the word is always used in the singular). thinks. Hopkins' 3) India, Old and New, 52. opinion that the defeat was on the Paruṣṇī, Yamunā being another name of that stream, is most improbable; nor is the view that Bheda was one of the ten kings essential. 4) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 260 et seq. Cf. Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 20, n.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 126; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 319, 327. Cf. Turvaśa.

bheda|भेद
2. Bheda is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) xii. 4, 49. 50. as having come to a bad end because he refused a cow (vaśā) to Indra when asked for it. That he is different from the preceding Bheda, as Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 13. assumes, is not certain. Indeed, it may very well be that his defeat led to his being chosen as the representative of the evil end of the wicked man. Moreover, the irreligious character of Bheda may be ascribed to his being a leader of non-Āryan folk, if the Ajas and Śigrus, with whom in the Rigveda he is connected or associated were, as is possible, though by no means certain, un-Āryan tribes of totemists. 3) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 153, who inclines to see in them totemistic tribes, but the names furnish the sole support of this conjecture. On this supposition they were probably non-Āryan. Cf. Aja.

bheShaja|भेषज
1. Bheṣaja, denoting a ‘remedial agent,’ ‘medicine,’ is often mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 89, 4; ii. 33, 2, etc. and later, 2) Av. v. 29, 1; vi. 21, 2, etc. being also used in a figurative sense. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 1, 1; 5, 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 41. Plants, 4) Rv. x. 97, and passim in the Atharvaveda. waters, 5) i. 23, 19. 20; 34, 6, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 4, 9, 2; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 7, etc. Possibly there is some truth in Zimmer's view, Altindisches Leben, 399, that the reference is to the beneficial effects of bathing. and spells 6) Exemplified in the medical spells of the Atharvaveda and the Kauśika Sūtra. are repeatedly enumerated as medicines. Most of the medical practices of the Atharvaveda are merely examples of sympathetic magic. For example, in one hymn 7) i. 22; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 264, et seq. the yellow of jaundice is entreated to pass into yellow birds. In another 8) vii. 116; Bloomfield, op. cit., 565 et seq. fever is to be banished by means of a frog; for the frog, being a potent means of cooling fire 9) Cf. Rv. x. 16, 14; Av. xviii. 3, 60. (because of its association with water), is regarded as analogously effective in banishing the fire of fever. See Bhiṣaj. 

bheShaja|भेषज
2. Bheṣaja in the plural is found in the Atharvaveda 1) xi. 6, 14. and in the Sūtras 2) Āśvalāyana Srauta Sūtra, x. 7, 3; Sāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 2, 10; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xii. 9, 10. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xxxi. 628. denoting the hymns of the Atharvaveda in so far as they are regarded as having ‘healing’ powers.

bhaimasena|भैमसेन
भैम-सेन,<BR> ‘descendant of Bhīmasena,’ is the name of a man in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (iv. 6, 6).

bhaimaseni|भैमसेनि
भैम-सेनि,<BR> ‘descendant of Bhīmasena,’ is the patronymic of Divodāsa in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 1) vii. 8 (Indische Studien, 3, 460, 472).

bhaiShajya|भैषज्य
भैषज्य<BR> in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xii, 7. 1, 12) and the Nirukta (x. 7. 25) denotes ‘healing remedy’ or ‘medicine,’ like Bheṣaja.

bhoga|भोग
भोग<BR> in the Rigveda 1) v. 29, 6; vi. 75, 14 (where the Hastaghna, or ‘hand-guard,’ of the archer is compared to a snake). and later 2) Av. xi. 9, 5; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 4, 5. 6; v. 4, 5, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiii. 4; xxi. 8, etc. denotes the ‘coil’ of a serpent.

bhoja|भोज
भोज<BR> in several passages of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 12. 14. 17) seems to be used as a king's title.

bhaujya|भौज्य
भौज्य<BR> in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) vii. 32; viii. 6. 12. 14. 16. denotes the rank of a prince bearing the title of Bhoja.

bhaumaka|भौमक
भौमक<BR> is the name of some animal in the late Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 1, 40.

bhaumii|भौमी
भौमी<BR> is the name of an animal in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 1) v. 5, 18, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99. 

bhauvana|भौवन
भौवन,<BR> ‘descendant of Bhuvana,’ is the patronymic of the mythical Viśvakarman in the Śatapatha (xiii. 7, 1, 15) and the Aitareya (viii. 21, 8. 10) Brāhmaṇas, and the Nirukta (x. 26).

bhauvaayana|भौवायन
भौवायन,<BR> ‘descendant of Bhuva,’ is the patronymic of Kapivana in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xx. 13, 4. It is also found in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxii. 2 (Indische Studien, 3, 473); Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 4, 5; and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 54, where Kapivana is not mentioned. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15 55, 69.

bhraatR|भ्रातृ
भ्रातृ<BR> is the common designation of ‘brother’ from the Rigveda 1) i. 164, 1; iv. 3, 13; v. 34, 4, etc.; Av. i. 14, 2; ii. 13, 5; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 8, 4, etc.; bhrātṛtva, Rv. viii. 20, 22; 83, 8; x. 108, 10. onwards. The word is also applied to a relation or close friend generally, 2) Böhtlingk and Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 462. but here the persons concerned are, it should be noted, in the Rigveda 3) i. 161, 1; 170, 2; iii. 53, 5; iv. 1, 2; vi. 51, 5; viii. 43, 16. Cf. Av. iv. 4, 5; v. 22, 12. deities, who are brothers of one another or of the worshipper. Thus in the early literature the word has not really lost its precise sense. The derivation from the root bhṛ, ‘support,’ is probably correct, designating the brother as the support of his sister. This harmonizes with the fact that in Vedic literature the brother plays the part of protector of his sister when bereft of her father, and that maidens deprived of their brothers (abhrātṛ) meet an evil fate. 4) Rv. i. 124, 7; iv. 5, 5; Av. i. 17, 1; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 328. Cf. Ayogū. The gradation of the relations in the home is shown by the order in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 5) vii. 15, 2. where father, mother, brother, and sister are successively mentioned. Strife between brothers is occasionally referred to. 6) Cf. Av. iii. 30, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 5, 3, where it is a sign of serious confusion; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, cxlv; Bloomfield Atharvaveda, 72. 

bhraatRvya|भ्रातृव्य
भ्रातृव्य<BR> is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) v. 22, 12, and perhaps x. 3, 9. where, being named with brother and sister, it must be an expression of relationship. The sense appears to be ‘(father's) brother's son,’ ‘cousin,’ 2) The word is rendered ‘cousin’ by Whitney in his Translation of the Atharvaveda (x. 6, 1; xv. 1, 8). this meaning alone accounting for the sense of ‘rival,’ ‘enemy,’ found elsewhere in the Atharvaveda, 3) ii. 18, 1; viii. 10, 18. 33; x. 9, 1. and repeatedly in the other Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 5, 9, 2, etc.; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 7; xxvii. 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 17; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, etc.; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 1, 21, etc.; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xii. 13, 2. Cf. Rv. viii. 21, 13. In an undivided family the relations of cousins would easily develop into rivalry and enmity. The original meaning may, however, have been ‘nephew,’ 5) Whitney, in his Translation of the Atharvaveda (ii. 18, 1), while rendering the word by ‘adversary,’ explains it in a note as meaning literally ‘nephew,’ or ‘brother's son.’ as the simple etymological sense would be ‘brother's son’; but this seems not to account for the later meaning so well. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 6) xxvii. 8. prescribes the telling of a falsehood to a Bhrātṛvya, who, further, is often given the epithets ‘hating’ (dviṣan) and ‘evil’ (apriya, pāpman) in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. 7) See several of the passages given in n. 4. The Atharvaveda 8) ii. 18, 1; x. 9, 1, etc. Cf. Tait tirīya Saṃhitā, i. 3. 2, 1, etc. Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 501, 506, 507, who thinks it means a kind of brother, and through early family conditions was restricted to cousins; Böhtlingk and Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 307. also contains various spells, which aim at destroying or expelling one's ‘rivals.’

bhruuNahan|भ्रूणहन्
भ्रूण-हन्,<BR> ‘slaying an embryo’; Bhrūṇa-hatyā, ‘the slaying of an embryo,’ are terms expressing a crime which is repeatedly and severely censured in the later Saṃhitās, 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 9; Kāthaka Sāṃhitā, xxxi. 7; Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā, xlvii (cited in Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 579, 580); Av. vi. 112, 3; 113, 2. The Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 10, 3, and Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 8; 11, have brahma-han instead; but see ibid., 12. where it is said to be the greatest of all crimes, and one of which the guilt cannot be removed. In many later passages 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 9, 15, 3; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 8, 2; x. 1, 15; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 3, 22. The substantive is found in Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 20, 1; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 7, 3; 8, 3; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iii. 1; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 18, 19; Nirukta, vi. 27. Bhrūṇa itself occurs in Rv. x. 155. 2. the same crime is referred to, always with reprobation: this fact alone shows the erroneousness of the theory 3) See Pati, p. 487, with n. 131. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 481; 10, 66; Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 17, 430; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 521, 522. that daughters could be allowed, once born, to die if their fathers so desired. M.

makaka|मकक
मकक,<BR> a word occurring once in the Atharvaveda (viii. 6, 12), may be the name of some unknown animal; but it is possibly an adjective having some such sense as ‘bleating.’

makara|मकर
मकर<BR> is the name of an animal, probably the ‘crocodile,’ 1) The Makara, as a Hindu sculptural ornament, originally represented a crocodile. Cf. Cousen's article in the Annual Report of the Archaological Survey of India for 1903-4, pp. 227-231 (where the Makara appears as the vehicle of Varuṇa and of Gaṅgā). Cf. also op. cit., 1904-5, pp. 80, 83, 84. which is included in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 13, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 16; Vāja saneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 35. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 97.

maxa|मक्ष
मक्ष,<BR> ‘fly,’ is found in the Rigveda 1) iv. 45, 4; vii. 32, 2. and the Atharvaveda, 2) ix. 1, 17. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 97. where its fondness for sweet things is alluded to. Cf. Admasad

maxaa|मक्षा
मक्षा, मक्षिका,<BR> denote both ‘fly’ 1) Makṣikā, Rv. i. 162, 9; Av. xi. 1, 2; 9, 10; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 3, 2. and ‘bee’ 2) Makṣā, Rv. x. 40, 6; Makṣikā, i. 119, 9; Praśna Upaniṣad, ii. 4, where a ‘king bee’ (madhukara-rājan) is referred to. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 97; Hillebrandt. Vedische Mythologie, 1, 240, n. 1. in the Rigveda and later. 

makha|मख
मख<BR> appears to designate a person in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) ix. 101, 13, where the Bhṛgus are mentioned as opposed to Makha (cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 51); x. 171, 2. but in neither passage does the context explain who he was. Probably a demon of some kind is meant. In the later Saṃhitās 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 57; xxxvii. 7; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 1, 8, 1; iii. 2, 4, 1. mention is also made of the ‘head of Makha,’ an expression which has become unintelligible to the Brāhmaṇas. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1, 2, 17. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

magadha|मगध
मगध<BR> is the name of a people who appear throughout Vedic literature as of little repute. Though the name is not actually found in the Rigveda, 1) See Kikaṭa. it occurs in the Atharvaveda, 2) v. 22, 14, where the Paippalāda recension has mayebhiḥ, which is a mere blunder, but substitutes the Kāśis for the Aṅgas. where fever is wished away to the Gandhāṛs and Mūjavants, northern peoples, and to the Aṅgas and Magadhas, peoples of the east. Again, in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda, 3) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 5, 22; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 1, 1. the Māgadha, or man of Magadha, is included as dedicated to ati-kruṣṭa, ‘loud noise’(?), while in the Vrātya hymn of the Atharvaveda 4) xv. 2, 1-4. the Māgadha is said to be connected with the Vrātya as his Mitra, his Mantra, his laughter, and his thunder in the four quarters. In the Śrauta Sūtras 5) Lāṭyāyar Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 6, 28; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxii. 4, 22. Cf. Sāyaṇa on Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 1, 16. 17. the equipment characteristic of the Vrātya is said to be given, when the latter is admitted into the Āryan Brahminical community, to a bad Brahmin living in Magadha (brahma-bandhu Māgadha-deśīya), but this point does not occur in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 6) xvii. 1, 16. On the other hand, respectable Brahmins sometimes lived there, for the Kauṣītaki Āraṇyaka 7) vii. 13; this is not mentioned in the earlier Aitareya Āraṇyaka. mentions Madhyama, Prātībodhī-putra, as Magadha-vāsin, ‘living in Magadha.’ Oldenberg, 8) Buddha, 400, n.; Weber, Indian Literature, 112, n. however, seems clearly right in regarding this as unusual. The Magadhas are evidently a people in the Baudhāyana and other Sūtras, 9) Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra, i. 2, 13; Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xx. 13; Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, xxii. 6, 18; Hiraṇyakeśi Śrauta Sūtra, xvii. 6. See Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Mergenländischen Gesellschaft, 56, 553. possibly also in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka. 10) ii. 1, 1. See Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 200; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 46, n. 4. It is therefore most improbable that Zimmer 11) Altindisches Leben, 35. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 20. can be right in thinking that in the Yajurveda 3) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 5, 22; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 1, 1. and the Atharvaveda 4) xv. 2, 1-4. the Māgadha is not a man of Magadha, but a member of the mixed caste produced by a Vaiśya marrying a Kṣatriya woman. 12) Manu, x. 11; Gautama Dharma Sūtra. iv. 17. So Sāyaṇa, on the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit., explains Māgadha, and Mahīdhara, on the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, offers this as one version. But the theory of mixed castes, in any case open to some doubt, cannot be accepted when used to explain such obviously tribal names as Māgadha. The fact that the Māgadha is often in later times a minstrel is easily accounted for by the assumption that the country was the home of minstrelsy and that wandering bards from Magadha were apt to visit the more western lands. This class the later texts recognize as a caste, inventing an origin by intermarriage of the old-established castes. The dislike of the Magadhas, which may be Rigvedic, since the Kīkaṭas were perhaps the prototype of the Magadhas, was in all probability due, as Oldenberg 13) Buddha, 400, n. thinks, to the fact that the Magadhas were not really Brahminized. This is entirely in accord with the evidence of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 14) i. 4, 1, 10 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 170 et seq.; Oldenberg, op. cit., 398. Kosala here appears as more Brahminical than Videha; it is interesting to note that, while Vaideha, like Māgadha, is used in the later theory as a name of a mixed caste, Kausalya is not so degraded (Oldenberg, 399, n.). that neither Kosala nor Videha were fully Brahminized at an early date, much less Magadha. Weber 15) See Indische Studien, 1, 52, 53; 185; 10, 99; Indian Literature, 79, n. 1; 111, 112. suggests two other grounds that may have influenced the position--the persistence of aboriginal blood and the growth of Buddhism. The latter consideration is hardly applicable to the Yajurveda or the Atharvaveda; but the imperfect Brahminization of the land, if substituted for it in accordance with Oldenberg's suggestion, would have some force. The former motive, despite Oldenberg's doubt, seems fully justified. Pargiter 16) Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, pp. 851-853. Cf. Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 6, 24, 260, 267. has gone so far as to suggest that in Magadha the Āryans met and mingled with a body of invaders from the east by sea. Though there is no evidence for this view in the Vedic texts, it is reasonable to suppose that the farther east the Āryans penetrated, the less did they impress themselves upon the aborigines. Modern ethnology confirms this a priori supposition in so far as it shows Āryan types growing less and less marked as the eastern part of India is reached, although such evidence is not decisive in view of the great intermixture of peoples in India.

magundii|मगुन्दी
मगुन्दी<BR> is the name of some pest occurring in a verse of an Atharvaveda hymn 1) ii. 14, 2. employed to exorcise evil influences. By that verse the ‘daughters of the Magundī’ are to be expelled from the cowstall, the wagon, and the house. It is uncertain whether an animal, insect, or demoness is meant. 2) Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 58.

magha|मघ
मघ<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 11, 3; 104, 5; iii. 13, 3; 19, 1; iv. 17, 8; v. 30, 12; 32, 12, etc.; Nirukta, v. 16. Very rarely later, e.g., Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xx. 67. denotes ‘bounty,’ and Maghavan 2) Rv. i. 31, 12; ii. 6, 4; 27, 17; v. 39, 4; 42, 8; vi. 27, 8, etc. So Magha-tti, ‘giving of gifts,’ Rv. iv. 37, 8; v. 79, 5; viii. 24, 10, etc.; Maghadeya, ‘giving of gifts,’ vii. 67, 9; x. 156, 2; Maghavat-tva, ‘liberality,’ vi. 27, 3. The word Maghavan is the epithet par excellence of Indra in the Rv. (iii. 30, 3; iv. 16, 1; 31, 7; 42, 5, etc.), and survives in post-Vedic literature as a name of Indra; otherwise, even in the later Saṃhitās, it is very rare, occurring practically as a divine epithet only (of Indra, Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 8, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 3, 13; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, ii. 11). is the regular Vedic name for the ‘generous giver’ of bounties to priests. It is doubtful whether the Maghavans were more than this, or had any special rank as a class in Vedic society. See Sabhā.

maghaa|मघा
मघा<BR> See Nakṣatra and Aghā.

mangala|मङ्गल
मङ्गल<BR> is the name of a teacher in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xxvi. 2). 

mangiira|मङ्गीर
मङ्गीर<BR> is found in an obscure verse in the Vaitāna 1) xxxiv. 9. and other 2) Mānava Srauta Sūtra, vii. 2, 7; Mandīrasya, Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 3, 21; Maṅkīrasya, Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, xxi. 20, 3. Sūtras with reference to cows. It is quite uncertain whether a river or a man 3) So apparently Garbe, Translation of the Vaitāna Sūtra, 97; Caland. Das Vaitānasūtra, 102; Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. is meant. The Gaṅgā (Ganges) and the Yamunā (Jumna) are mentioned in the same verse. The correct form of the word is doubtful. 4) See the variants in n. 2.

manjiShThaa|मञ्जिष्ठा
मञ्जिष्ठा,<BR> ‘madder,’ is mentioned in the Aitareya (iii. 2, 4) and Śāṅkhāyana (viii. 7) Āraṇyakas.

maTachii|मटची
मटची<BR> occurs in a passage of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 1) i. 10, 1. where reference is made to the Kurus being overwhelmed by Maṭacīs. 2) Maṭacī-hata. Śaṅkara interprets the word by ‘thunderbolts’ (aśanayaḥ), while Ānandatīrtha in his commentary gives, as an alternative rendering, pāṣāṇa-vṛṣṭayaḥ--i.e., ‘hailstones,’ which may be the sense. The Śabdakalpadruma, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. agreeing with Ānandatīrtha, 4) On Brahmasūtra, iii. 4, 28. says that Maṭacī means, ‘a kind of small red bird’ (rakta-varṇa-kṣudra-pakṣi-viśeṣa, reading -pakṣī-), and Jacob 5) Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1911, p. 510. suggests that the ‘locust’ is meant.

maNi|मणि
मणि<BR> is the name in the Rigveda 1) i. 33, 8. and later 2) Av. i. 29, 1; ii. 4, 1, 2; viii. 5, 1 et seq.; x. 6, 24; xii. 1, 44; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 3, 4, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxv. 15; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 6; Nirukta, vii. 23, where Durga, in his commentary, takes Maṇi as āditya-maṇi, or ‘sun-stone,’ while the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., suggests that a crystal used as a burning glass may be meant. of a ‘jewel’ used as an amulet against all kinds of evil. That either ‘pearl’ 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. or ‘diamond’ 4) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben 53. is denoted is not clear. 5) The expression hiraṇya maṇi in Rv i. 33, 8, might possibly mean ‘gold a an ornament,’ but ‘gold (and) jewels is more probable. Cf. Av. xii. 1, 44, where maṇiṃ hiraṇyam must mean a jewel (and) gold.’ It is evident that the Maṇi could be strung on a thread (sūtra), which is referred to in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 6) xx. 16, 6. and elsewhere; 7) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 18, 8. Cf. iii. 4, 13; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 248; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 3, 4, 2. the Maṇi was certainly also worn round the neck, for in the Rigveda 8) i. 122, 14. occurs the epithet maṇi-grīva, ‘having a jewel on the neck.’ An amulet of Bilva is celebrated in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 9) xii. 18 et seq. and many varieties of amulet are there enumerated. 10) xii. 8. The ‘jeweller’ (maṇi-kāra) is mentioned in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 11) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 7; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 3, 1. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 337; Zimmer, op. cit., 253; Weber, Omina und Portenta, 317, 374; Indische Studien, 2, 2, n. 4; 5, 386; 18, 37; Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1891, 796. Weber is inclined to detect a Babylonian origin of Maṇi (cf. Manā), but the evidence is not convincing.

maNika|मणिक
मणिक<BR> in the late Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa 1) Weber, Omina und Portenta, 316. and the Sūtras 2) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, ii. 9, 3; iv. 6, 4; Gobhila Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 1, 26; iii. 9, 6. 7, etc.; Sāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, ii. 14. denotes a large ‘water bottle.’

maNDa|मण्ड
मण्ड,<BR> n., is found in the compound nau-maṇḍa (du.), denoting the two ‘rudders’ of a ship in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) ii. 3, 3, 15. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 345, n. 3, who, following the commentary, accepts ‘sides’ as the meaning; Caland, U7ber das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 60.

maNDuuka|मण्डूक
मण्डूक<BR> is the name of ‘frog’ in the Rigveda 1) vii. 103, 1; x. 166, 5. and later, 2) Av. vii. 112, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 4, 4, 3; 7, 11, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiii. 1; xxi. 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 36; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xii. 4, 16; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ix. 1, 2, 20 et seq.; Nirukta, ix. 5. the feminine Maṇḍūkī also occurring. 3) Rv. x. 16, 14; Av. xviii. 3, 60; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvii. 6; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 6, 1, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 17; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 10, 1; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, vi. 4, 1. The famous frog hymn of the Rigveda 4) vii. 103. Cf. Av. iv. 15, 12, as explained by Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 223, where reference is made to frogs in the clefts of the earth (Iriṇa). compares with Brahmins the frogs croaking as they awake to activity at the beginning of the rains. It has been explained by Max Müller 5) Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 494, 495. as a satire on the Brahmins. Geldner, 6) Rigveda, Kommentar, 117. agreeing with this view, thinks that it is directed by its Vasiṣṭha composer against rival Brahmins, probably the Viśvāmitras. 7) Geldner, loc. cit., very plausibly points out that the last Pāda of this Vasiṣṭha hymn is borrowed from the most important Viśvāmitra hymn (Rv. iii. 53, 7). The view, however, which interprets the hymn as a rain charm 8) Yāska, Nirukta, ix. 5; Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 173-179. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 151; Sanskrit Literature, 121, 122. seems on the whole more likely. The frog, from its connexion with water, was considered to have cooling properties. Thus after the burning of the dead body the frog is invited to come to the spot where the cremation has taken place in order to cool it down. 9) Rv. x. 16, 14. See Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 11, 342350; Lanman in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 850. Similarly the frog is invoked in the Atharvaveda against the fire of fever. 10) Av. vii. 116. See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 565. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95.

matsya|मत्स्य
1. Matsya, ‘fish,’ is mentioned only once in the Rigveda, 1) x. 68, 8. but frequently later. 2) Av. xi. 2, 25; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 9, 5; 14, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 21, 34; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 6, 1; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 1, 1 (the famous fish of the deluge legend); Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 4, 3; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, i. 2; mahā-matsya, ‘great fish,’ Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 3, 18. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 3, 12 (cf. Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 7, 8; Sāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 2, 23), a Matsya Sāṃmada is personfied as the king of the fishes.

matsya|मत्स्य
2. Matsya appears to be the name of a people in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) vii. 18, 6. where they are ranged with the other enemies of Sudās, although it is possible to see merely the sense of ‘fish’ in that passage. In the list of Aśvamedhins, ‘offerers of the horse sacrifice,’ in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 2) xiii. 5, 4, 9. Dhvasan Dvaitavana is mentioned as a Matsya king (Mātsya). The Matsyas as a people occur also in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 3) iv. 1. in connexion with the Vaśas, 4) This is the most probable reading, which results from a comparison with Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 9, where Śālva-Matsyeṣu is followed by savaśaUśīnareṣu (misprinted śavaśa-). See Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 367. The older view was SatvanMatsyeṣu, Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 1, lxxvii, following Cowell; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Satvant. and in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa 5) i. 2, 9. in connexion with Śālvas. In Manu 6) ii. 19; vii. 193. the Kurukṣetra, the Matsyas, the Pancālas, and the Śūrasenakas comprise the land of the Brahmin Ṛṣis (brahmarṣi-deśa). There is no reason to doubt that the Matsyas occupied much the same territory as in Epic times, say Alwar, Jaipur, Bharatpur. 7) See Vincent Smith, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 56, 675. Cf. von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 166; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 211; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 127.

madaavatii|मदावती
मदा-वती,<BR> ‘intoxicating,’ is the name of a plant in the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 16, 2; cf. iv. 7, 4. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 292; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 465; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72.

madugha|मदुघ
मदुघ,<BR> ‘honey-plant,’ 1) The literal meaning is probably ‘yielding honey,’ the word being, according to the commentator, derived from madhu-dugha, a word actually occurring in the Rigveda (vi. 70, 1. 5). is the name of a sweet herb in the Atharvaveda. 2) i. 34, 4; vi. 102, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 386, n.; 404; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 34, 35, 355; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 275; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 69. The spelling is somewhat uncertain, since many manuscripts read Madhugha. 3) These two forms probably stand by haplology for ma[dhu]-dugha and madhu-[du]gha. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 64, 1a.

madgu|मद्गु
मद्गु,<BR> ‘diver’ (from the root majj, 1) See Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 38c; 44a 3a. ‘dive’), is the name of some aquatic bird which is included in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 20, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 22. 34. and is occasionally mentioned elsewhere. 3) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 8, 1. 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93. 

madya|मद्य
मद्य,<BR> ‘intoxicating liquor,’ is not mentioned until the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 1) v. 11, 5. The word is found in the Epic and often in the Dharmaśāstras, as well as in medical texts. where it occurs in the compound madya-pā, ‘drinking intoxicating liquor.’

madra|मद्र
मद्र<BR> denotes a people who are mentioned in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad; 1) iii. 3, 1; 7, 1 Kāpya Patañcala was then living among them. Their name appears elsewhere in Vedic literature, only in that of a branch, the Uttara Madras, the ‘northern Madras,’ who are referred to in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 2) viii. 14, 3 as living beyond the Himālaya (pareṇa Himavantam) in the neighbourhood of the Uttara Kurus, probably, as Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 102. conjectures, in the land of Kaśmīr. The Madras mentioned in the Upaniṣad were, like the Kurus, probably settled somewhere in Kurukṣetra in the Madhyadeśa or ‘Middle Land.’ Cf. Madragāra.

madragaarashaungaayani|मद्रगारशौङ्गायनि
मद्र-गार शौङ्गायनि<BR> (‘descendant of Śuṅga’) is the name of a teacher, whose pupil was Kāmboja Aupamanyava in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 102. concludes, with probability, that these names point to a connexion of the Kambojas and the Madras.

madhu|मधु
मधु<BR> denotes anything sweet used as food, and especially drink, ‘mead,’ 1) The word is etymologically identical with Greek , ‘intoxicating drink,’ and Anglo-Saxon medu, ‘mead.’ a sense often found in the Rigveda. 2) Used as an adjective, ‘sweet,’ in Rv. i. 90, 6. 8; 187, 2; iii. 1, 8; iv. 34, 2; 42, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxviii. 10, etc.; as a substantive, Rv. i. 154, 4; ii. 37, 5; iii. 39, 6; iv. 38, 10, etc.; Av. vi. 69, 1; ix. 1, 22; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 2, 4, 13, etc. More precisely it denotes either ‘Soma’ 3) Rv. i. 19, 9; ii. 19, 2; 34, 5; 36, 4; iii. 43, 3; iv. 18, 13, etc. or ‘milk,’ 4) Rv. i. 117, 6; 169, 4; 177, 3; iii. 8, 1; vii. 24, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vi. 2, etc. or less often ‘honey,’ 5) Rv. viii. 4, 8 (where the sense is made certain by the adjective sāragha, ‘derived from the bee’); perhaps also iv. 45, 4; vii. 32, 2; viii. 24, 20, and, according to Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 239 et seq., in many other passages; Av. ix. 1, 17, 19; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 10, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 9, 7; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 15; viii. 5. 20; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 2, 1. 2; xi. 5, 4, 18; Bṛhadāraṇyaka, ii. 5, 1; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 9, 1, etc. which, however, is the most definite sense in the later literature. Taboos against the use of honey are recorded. 6) In the case of women, Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 55, 2; of students, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 4, 18. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 321; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

madhukapaingya|मधुकपैङ्ग्य
मधुक पैङ्ग्य<BR> (‘descendant of Piṅga’) is the name of a teacher mentioned in the Śatapatha 1) xi. 7, 2, 8; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 3, 17. 18 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 3, 8 Kāṇva). and the Kauṣītaki 2) xvi. 9. Brāhmaṇas.

madhukashaa|मधुकशा
मधु-कशा,<BR> 1) Rv. i. 22, 3; 157, 4, Av. x. 7, 19; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxi. 10, 12. or Madhoḥ Kasā, 2) Av. ix. 1, 5. is the name in the Rigveda of the Aśvins’ ‘honey-whip,’ by which they impart sweetness to the sacrifice. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. ingeniously conjectures that the idea was derived from an instrument provided with thongs for whipping milk, a ‘milk-whip.’

madhukRt|मधुकृत्
मधु-कृत्,<BR> ‘honey-maker,’ denotes ‘bee’ in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i, 5, 6, 5; iv. 2, 9, 6, etc. and the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 10, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 2, 1. 2; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iii. 1, 2; vi. 9, 1, etc.

madhuChandas|मधुछन्दस्
मधु-छन्दस्,<BR> the reputed author of the first ten hymns of the first Maṇḍala of the Rigveda, is mentioned as a Ṛṣi in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 1) xxviii. 2. and the Aitareya Āraṇyaka. 2) i. 1, 3. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 3) vii. 17, 7; 18, 1; cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 26, 1 et seq. Cf. Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 167. he counts as the fifty-first son of Viśvāmitra, and his Praüga (hymn at the morning service) is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 4) xiii. 5, 1, 8.

madhubraahmaNa|मधुब्राह्मण
मधु-ब्राह्मण,<BR> ‘the Brāhmaṇa of the Honey,’ is the designation of a certain mystical doctrine in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) iv. 1, 5, 18; xiv. 1, 4, 13; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 5, 16. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 290.

madhyadesha|मध्यदेश
मध्य-देश,<BR> the ‘Middle Country,’ is, according to the Mānava Dharma Śāstra, 1) ii. 21. the land between the Himālaya in the north, the Vindhya in the south, Vinaśana in the west, and Prayāga (now Allahabad) in the east--that is, between the place where the Sarasvatī disappears in the desert, and the point of the confluence of the Yamunā (Jumna) and the Gaṅgā (Ganges). The same authority 2) ii. 19. defines Brahmarṣi-deśa as denoting the land of Kurukṣetra, the Matsyas, Pañcālas, and Śūrasenakas, and Brahmāvarta 3) ii. 17. 19. as meaning the particularly holy land between the Sarasvatī and the Dṛṣadvatī. The Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra 4) i. 2, 9; Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, i. 8. defines Āryāvarta as the land east of Vinaśana; west of the Kālaka-vana, ‘Black Forest,’ or rather Kanakhala, near Hardvār; south of the Himālaya; and north of the Pāriyātra or the Pāripātra Mountains; adding that, in the opinion of others, 5) Baudhāyana, i. 2, 10; Vasiṣṭha, i. 12. See on Kanakhala, Hultzsch, Indian Antiquary, 34, 179. it was confined to the country between the Yamunā and the Gaṅgā, while the Bhāllavins 6) Baudhāyana, i. 2, 11. 12; Vasiṣṭha, i. 14. 15, quoting in each case a verse of the Nidāna (what work is referred to is not certain; there is similar doubt as to the quotation in the Nidāna of the Bhāllavi Brāhmaṇa, according to the Bṛhaddevatā, v. 23, where see Macdonell's note, and cf. Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, 3, n.). took it as the country between the boundary-river (or perhaps the Saras vatī) 7) The readings are doubtful, varying between sindhur vidhāraṇī or vidharaṇī and sindhur vicaraṇī or visavaṇī. The latter expression must refer to the Sarasvatī; the former may, but not necessarily. Conceivably the Sindhu (Indus) is meant; for it was a great boundary, with Āryan tribes to the east of it. and the region where the sun rises. The Mānava Dharma Śāstra, 8) ii. 22. in accord with the Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, 9) i. 9. defines Āryāvarta as the region between the Vindhya and the Himālaya, the two ranges which seem to be the boundaries of the Āryan world in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad also. 10) ii. 13. Cf. Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 28, n. 1. The term Madhyadeśa is not Vedic, but it is represented in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 11) viii. 14, 3. The Uśīnaras may be recognized as in the north, for the Buddhist texts give Usīragiri as the northern boundary of the middle country. See Hultzsch, Indian Antiquary, 34, 179. by the expression madhyamā pratiṣṭhā diś, ‘the middle fixed region,’ the inhabitants of which are stated to be the Kurus, the Pañcālas, the Vaśas, and the Uśīnaras. The latter two peoples practically disappear later on, the Madhyadeśa being the country of the Kuru-Pañcālas, the land where the Brāhmaṇas and the later Saṃhitās were produced, bounded on the east by the Kosala-Videhas, and on the west by the desert. The western tribes are mentioned with disapproval both in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 12) ix. 3, 1, 8. and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 13) iii. 44, 3; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 245. while the tradition of the Brahminization of the Kosalas and the Videhas from the Kuru-Pañcāla country is preserved in the former Brāhmaṇa. 14) i. 4, 1. Cf. Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, 2, 3; 146, 147, who points out that the Pāripātra Mountains are a part of the Vindhya range in Mālvā, and who suggests that the western boundary was originally the Ādarśa Mountains; for the reading of the manuscripts, and of the scholiast Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita, in the Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, i. 8, is prāg ādarśanāt, not adarśanāt (corresponding with the Vinaśana of Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra, i. 2, 9), and the Mahābhāṣya on Pāṇini, ii. 4, 10, has prāg ādarśāt. See also for the Buddhist ‘Middle Country’ an article by Rhys Davids, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1904, 83 et seq., with Fleet's corrections, ibid., 1907, 657; and cf. Keith, ibid., 1908, 1143; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 58, 59; Indian Empire, 1, 303, 304, where the extraordinary theory is adopted that the Madhyadeśa was peopled by a new race of immigrant Āryans, who, travelling viā Chitral and Gilgit, and bringing no women with them, married Dravidian women, and produced the so-called Āryo-Dravidians. It is quite impossible to find any support for this theory in Vedic literature. To say, as is there said, that the ‘Vedic hymns contain no reference to the route by which the Āryans entered India or to their earlier settlements on the Indus,’ and that this is explained by the theory of the entry of the Vedic Indians viā Chitral, is to assert absurdities. The theory is based on the later dialects and their affinities (see Grierson, Indian Empire, 1, 357 et seq.); it can probably not be regarded as at all valid for any period--at any rate, it is not cogent for the eighth century, B.C.

मध्यं-दिन,<BR> ‘mid-day,’ is a frequent designation of time in the Rigveda, 1) iv. 28, 3; viii. 1, 29; 13, 13; 27, 19; x. 151, 5, etc. the later Saṃhitās, 2) Av. ix. 6, 46; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 5, 4, etc. and the Brāhmaṇas. 3) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xv. 9, 16; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 3, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 3, 9; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, ii. 9, 6; 14, 1, etc. The word is sometimes used as an abbreviation for the ‘midday libation’ (like mittag in German for ‘midday meal’) in Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 2, 5; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxix. 8. Cf. Ahan.

madhyamavah|मध्यमवह्
मध्यम-वह्<BR> occurs in one passage of the Rigveda 1) ii. 29, 4. as an epithet of the chariot. The exact interpretation is doubtful. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 210. The context seems to require the sense of ‘keeping away’ from the sacrifice. Cf. Pūrvavah. assigns to it the expression the sense of ‘driving with a single horse between the shafts.’ According to Sāyana's explanation, it means ‘driving with middling speed.’ It might mean ‘driving in the middle’--that is, ‘only half-way.’^3

madhyamashii|मध्यमशी
मध्यम-शी<BR> is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 97, 12 = Av. iv. 9, 4 = Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xii. 86. where Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. assigns to the word the meaning of intercessor, which Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 180. Cf. Dharma. accepts, in the sense of ‘mediator’ or ‘arbiter,’ as a legal term, but which Roth may, as Lanman 4) In Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 159. But see Roth, Siebenzig Lieder, 174, which Lanman may have overlooked, since he does not refer to it. suggests, have intended to express ‘adversary’ or ‘preventer’ of the disease referred to in the hymn. Whitney 5) Loc. cit. thinks that it means ‘mid most man’ or ‘chief’ as the one round whom his followers encamp. 6) Madhyamaśivan, in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 408, is obscure. Geldner, 7) Rigveda, Glossar, 131; Kommentar, 196 (where he seems to decide in favour of derivation from śī, not śṛ). however, thinks that a third king, who is ‘neutral’ between two enemies, is intended.

madhyamastha|मध्यमस्थ
मध्यम-स्थ,<BR> 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxvii. 5. Madhyame-ṣṭha, 2) Av. iii. 8, 2, and cf. Madhyamastheya, ‘position of chief,’ Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 5, 1. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 96. in the later Saṃhitās denotes the chief in his relation to his followers (sajāta). Cf. Madhyamaśī.

madhyaavarSha|मध्यावर्ष
मध्या-वर्ष,<BR> the ‘middle of the rains,’ is specially mentioned as a time of the year in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 1) i. 3. and in the Sūtras. 2) Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iii. 5, 5. 7, etc.

manasa|मनस
मनस,<BR> occurring in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) v. 44, 10. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 139. seems clearly to be the name of a Ṛṣi, in accordance with Sāyaṇa's interpretation.

manaa|मना
मना<BR> is found in one passage of the Rigveda 1) viii. 78, 2. in an enumeration of gifts, where it is described as ‘golden’ (sacā manā hiraṇyayā). It therefore seems to designate some ornament, or possibly a weight, and has accordingly been compared 2) As. e.g., by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 50, 51; Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 386; 17, 202, 203; Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 1, xxii; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 278. with the Greek  (Herodotus has ), the Latin mina. All three words have been considered Semitic in origin, as borrowed from the Phœnicians 3) Or perhaps from Babylon viā Asia Minor. The part played by the Phœnicians in Greek life is now reduced within narrow limits; in the case of the mina, probably their commercial activities may be considered as likely to have caused the adoption of the term. in the case of Greece, from Carthage by way of Etruria or Sicily in the case of Rome, and from Babylon in the case of India. The identification as regards Manā is very conjectural, depending merely on the probabilities of Babylonian borrowing 4) See, e.g., for borrowing, Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 276; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 50, 43 et seq.; Bühler, Indian Studies, 3, 16 et seq.; Indische Palœographie, 17; Vincent Smith, Indian Antiquary, 34, 230. On the other side, cf. Max Müller, India, 133-138; Hopkins, Religions of India, 160; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 139 (as regards the flood legend): Bloomfield, Religions of India, 133 et seq. (as regards the Ādityas). seen--e.g., in the legend of the flood, and in the system of the Nakṣatras. On the other hand, Mahā may very well be identical with the word manā which occurs several times in the Rigveda 5) i. 173, 2; iv. 33, 2, x. 6, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iv. 19; ‘jealousy, Rv. ii. 33, 5, Kanśika Sūtra, cvii. 2. There are also the derivatives manā-ya, ‘think of,’ ‘be zealous’: Rv. i. 133, 4; ii. 26, 2; manā-ya, ‘desirous’: Rv. i. 92, 9; iv. 24, 7; manā-vasu, ‘rich in devotion’: Rv. v. 74, 1. in the sense of ‘desire’ (from the root man, ‘think’), and which may have in this one passage the concrete sense of ‘desirable object.’ It is to be noted that in Böhtlingk's Dictionary a single word Manā appears, to which the only senses assigned are ‘wish,’ ‘desire,’ ‘jealousy.’

manaavii|मनावी
मनावी,<BR> ‘wife of Manu,’ is mentioned in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 1) xxx. 1 (Indische Studien, 3, 462). and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 2) i. 1, 4, 16. See Manu.

manu|मनु
मनु<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 80, 16; ii. 33. 13; viii. 63. 1; x. 100, 5, etc. See Macdonell, Velk Mythology, 50. and later 2) Av. xiv. 2, 41; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 5, 1, 3; vii. 5. 15, 3; ii. 5, 9, 1; 6, 7, 1; iii. 3, 2, 1; v. 4, 10, 5; vi. 6. 6, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. viii. 15; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 4. 14, etc. Jainiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 15, 2, etc. has no claim to historical reality. He is simply the first man, father of the race, and its guide in all matters, sacrificial and other. Hence the views of the texts on inheritance are foisted on Manu and his youngest son, Nābhānediṣṭha. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 9, 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 14, 1. 2. He also plays the part of the hero in the Vedic legend of the flood. 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 1, 1 et seq., Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 2. Manu is called Vivasvan 5) Rv. viii. 52, 1. or Vaivasvata, 6) Av. viii. 10, 24; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 3, 3; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 7; Nirukta, xii. 10. ‘son of Vivasvant’ (the god); Sāvarṇi, 6) Av. viii. 10, 24; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 3, 3; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 7; Nirukta, xii. 10. ‘descendant of Savarṇā’ (the substitute of Saraṇyū in the legend of her wedding); and Sāṃvaraṇi, 7) Rv. viii. 51, 1; Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 180, n., conjectures Sāvarṇi instead. Cf. Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 38. ‘descendant of Saṃvaraṇa.’ The first name is, of course, mythical. The other two have been regarded as historical, Sāvarṇi being taken by Ludwig 8) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 195; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, 240; Lévi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 114 et seq.; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Muir, Sanskrit texts, 1^2, 161 et seq.; Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, 25, lvii et seq.; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 340 et seq. as a king of the Turvaśas, but this is very doubtful.

manoravasarpaNa|मनोरवसर्पण
मनोर् अवसर्पण<BR> is the name, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) i. 8, 1, 8. of the mountain on which the vessel of Manu rested. In the Epic the name is Naubandhana, but the view 2) See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 139; Whitney, Indische Studien, 1, 162; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 30; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 676. that it is alluded to as Nāvaprabhraṃśana in the Atharvaveda 3) xix. 39, 8. is now abandoned. 4) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 961; Macdonell, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 1107.

manuShyaraaja|मनुष्यराज
मनुष्य-राज<BR> 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 30; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 15, 6; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiv. 7. and Manuṣya-rājan 2) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xviii. 10, 5; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 26, 4. denote in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas a ‘king of men.’ Cf. Rājan.

manuShyavish|मनुष्यविश्
मनुष्य-विश्,<BR> 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 9, 1. Manuṣya-viśa, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 4, 7, 7; vi. 1, 5, 3. and Manuṣya-viśā 3) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 6; xxiii. 8. denote ‘mankind,’ ‘the human race,’ in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. 

mantra|मन्त्र
मन्त्र<BR> (from the root man, ‘think’) denotes in the Rigveda 1) i. 31, 13; 40, 5; 67, 4; 74, 1; 152, 2; ii. 35, 2, etc. and later 2) Av. xv. 2, 1; xix. 54, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 5, 4, 1; 5, 1, etc. the ‘hymn’ as the product of the singer's creative thought. In the Brāhmaṇas 3) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 14, 23; vi. 1; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxvi. 3. 5; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 4, 6; xi. 2, 1, 6, Nirukta, vii. 1, etc.; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vii. 1, 3. the word is regularly used of the poetic and prose utterances of the Ṛṣis, including not merely the verse parts of the Saṃhitās, but also the prose formulæ that betray by their style their special and archaic character. 4) Bloomfield, Vedic Concordance, viii; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 298. Macdonel's Vedic Grammar covers the Mantra material of the Vedic Saṃhitās, prose as well as poetry.

mantrakRt|मन्त्रकृत्
मन्त्र-कृत्<BR> in the Rigveda 1) ix. 114, 2. and the Brāhmaṇas 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1, 1; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 24; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iv. 1. denotes a poet as a ‘maker of Mantras.’

mantha|मन्थ
मन्थ<BR> in the Rigveda 1) x. 86, 15. and later 2) Av. ii. 29, 6; v. 29, 7; x. 6, 2; xviii. 4, 42; xx. 127, 9; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 5, 1, etc. denotes a drink in which solid ingredients are mixed with a fluid by stirring, usually parched barley-meal (Saktu) with milk. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 2, 1, 2; Suśruta, 1, 233, 12, in St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1b ad fin. All sorts of mixed beverages of this type are mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka. 4) xii. 8. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 268, 269; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 108

manthaa|मन्था
मन्था<BR> in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 28, 4. seems to mean a ‘churn.’ So the root math denotes to ‘churn’ in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 2) ii. 2, 10, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 2, 6; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 6, 1. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 161. In one passage of the Atharvaveda 3) xx. 127, 9. Scheftelowitz in Khila, v. 10, 3, reads manthāṁ with Pluti, following the Kaśmīr MS., but misquoting the Atharvan text. the word is used to denote a drink like Mantha. 

manthaavala|मन्थावल
मन्थावल<BR> is the name of an animal in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 1) iii. 26, 3. a sort of snake according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary. Sāyaṇa 2) P. 291 (ed. Aufrecht). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 86. understands it to be a kind of animal which hangs head downwards from the branches of trees, meaning, presumably, the flying fox. 3) This is the probable meaning of the word according to Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Mānthāla, Mānthīlava.

manthin|मन्थिन्
मन्थिन्<BR> in the Rigveda 1) iii. 32, 2; ix. 46, 4. Tilak's conjecture that the planets are referred to here is absurd. See Orion, 162; Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, xciv. and later 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 6, 3; vi. 4, 10, 1; vii. 2, 7, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vii. 18; viii. 57; xiii. 57; xviii. 19; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 6, etc. denotes Soma juice mixed with meal (Saktu) by stirring.

mandiira|मन्दीर
मन्दीर<BR> is perhaps the name of a man whose cattle, according to a Mantra in the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xiii. 3, 21), did not drink the water of the Gaṅgā (Ganges). See Maṅgīra.

mandhaatR|मन्धातृ
1. Mandhātṛ occurs in several passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 112, 13; viii. 39, 8; 40, 12; x. 2, 2. in all of which Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. takes the word as merely an adjective used substantively, ‘the pious man.’ In one passage 3) Rv. x. 2, 2. the word, being applied to Agni, is thus used, but in another 4) Rv. viii. 40, 12. Mandhātṛvat being parallel with Aṅgirasvat, ‘like Aṅgiras,’ is naturally to be understood as a proper name, which is probably also the sense of the word in the preceding hymn. 5) Rv. viii. 39, 8. A different Mandhātṛ 6) Rv. i. 112, 13. may be meant in the first Maṇḍala, 6) Rv. i. 112, 13. where he is mentioned as a protégé of the Aśvins, and evidently as a king. To equate these persons, and make a Rājarṣi out of Mandhātṛ, as Ludwig 7) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 107. where he attributes Rv. viii. 39-42 to him as a Nābhāka, ‘descendant of Nabhāka.’ and Griffith 8) Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 147. do, is unnecessary and improbable. 

mandhaatRyauvanaashva|मन्धातृयौवनाश्व
2. Mandhātṛ Yauvanāśva (‘descendant of Yuvanāśva’) is in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa 1) i. 2, 10 et seq. Cf. Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 111. the name of an emperor who was instructed by Vicārin, son of Kabandha Ātharvaṇa.

manyaa|मन्या
मन्या<BR> (plur.), ‘nape of the neck,’ occurs in a passage of the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 25, 1. directed against a disease which Bloomfield 2) Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, October, 1887, xix; American Journal of Philology, 11, 327 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 472. regards as scrofulous swellings on the neck. He compares the disease Manskunder, ‘tumours of the neck’ (which looks like a combination of the words manyā and skandhyā, ‘pains of the neck and shoulders,’ both occurring in verses 1 and 3 of the Atharvan hymn), mentioned by Wise. 3) System of Hindu Medicine, 316. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 202; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 298, 299.

mamataa|ममता
ममता<BR> is, according to Sāyaṇa, in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) vi. 10, 2. Cf. Mahābhārata, i. 4179 et seq. the wife of Ucathya and the mother of Dīrghatamas. But the word may be merely an abstract noun meaning ‘selfinterest,’ a sense which it often has in the later language. Oldenberg 2) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 212. finds a mention of Mamata (masc.) in a verse of the Rigveda 3) vi. 50, 15, where the reading of the received text is mama tasya. as the name of a Bharadvāja.

maya|मय
मय<BR> is found once in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (xxii. 19) in the sense of ‘horse.’

mayu|मयु
मयु<BR> occurs in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 12, 1; Vājasanevi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 31. The commentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 12, 1: Vājasanevi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 31. explains the word as meaning either an ‘ape’ (kiṃpuruṣa) or a ‘forest peacock’ (āraṇya-mayūra). The former sense is supported by another passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 2) viii. 47; mayu āraṇya in Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 10, 1. where the Mayu, being a substitute for the man, must be an ape. This sense also suits the word in the other passage 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 5, 2, 22. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 85; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 246. where it occurs.

mayuukha|मयूख
मयूख<BR> denotes, from the Rigveda onwards, 1) Rv. vii. 99, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 1, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 6; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 15, 9. etc. a ‘peg,’ especially as used for keeping a web stretched. 2) Rv. x. 130, 2 (in a metaphor); Av. x. 7, 42; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvi. 6; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 5, 3, etc. Cf. Otu.

mayuura|मयूर
मयूर,<BR> ‘peacock,’ occurs in the Rigveda in the compounds describing Indra's horses, mayūra-roman, 1) Rv. iii. 45, 1. ‘with hair like peacocks’ feathers,’ and mayūra-śepya, 2) Rv. viii. 1, 25. ‘with tails like those of peacocks.’ The peacock also appears in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 3) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 23. 27. The pea-hen, Mayūrī, is mentioned in the Rigveda 4) i. 191, 14 (a late hymn). and the Atharvaveda, 5) vii. 56, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 90. in both cases with reference to the bird's efficacy against poison, a curious superstition to be compared with the modern dislike of peacocks' feathers.

mariichi|मरीचि
मरीचि<BR> in the plural denotes according to Weber, 1) Indische Studien, 9, 9, accepted by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. the ‘particles of light’ or ‘shining motes’ that fill the air, as opposed to rays of light (raśmi). This meaning adequatelysuits the passages in the early Vedic literature 2) Rv. x. 57, 12; 177, 1; Av. iv. 38, 5 (where raśmi and marīci are opposed); v. 27, 10; vi. 113, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 4, 5, 5 (marīci-pa, ‘drinking atoms of light,’ said of the gods); Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 9, 2 (where Sāyaṇa's version, sarvatra-prasṛtaprabhā-dravya, refers to the light as everywhere diffused), etc. where the word occurs; but the sense of ‘ray’ is quite clearly found in the Upaniṣads, 3) Praśna Upaniṣad, iv. 2. Cf. Taittirīya Upaniṣad, i. 1, 2; 2, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad, vi. 31. as well as the older sense. 4) Aitareya Upaniṣad, i. 2.

maru|मरु
मरु,<BR> in the plural, is mentioned in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, 1) v. 1, 1. as the utkara (‘mound of earth thrown up’ from the excavation of the altar 2) Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, xii. 25, 54. ) of Kurukṣetra. This seems to mean that the Maru deserts (the later Maru-sthala) 3) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 48, and Dhanvan. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 78. were so called because they stood to the ‘altar,’ Kurukṣetra, in the same relation as the waste earth of the utkara to the altar at the sacrifice.

maruttaaavixita|मरुत्तआविक्षित
मरुत्त आवि-क्षित<BR> (‘descendant of Avikṣit’) Kāma-pri (‘descendant of Kāmapra’) is the name of a king who was anointed by Saṃvarta according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 1) viii. 21, 12. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) xiii. 5, 4, 6. Cf. also Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 9, 14. 16; Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad, i. 4. account of the same king he is called Āyogava.

marudvRdhaa|मरुद्वृधा
मरुद्-वृधा<BR> 1) Literally, ‘rejoicing in the Maruts’ -i.e., ‘swollen by the rainy winds.’ The misspelling of the name as Marudvṛddhā in Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 80, 88, is corrected in the Index and the Addenda of that work. On the accentuation of the name, see Vārttika 2 on Pāṇini, vi. 2, 106. is the name of a stream mentioned in the Nadīstuti (‘Praise of Rivers’) in the Rigveda 2) x. 75, 5. along with the Asiknī (Akesines) and the Vitastā (Hydaspes). Roth 3) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 138 et seq. considers that the Marudvṛdhā denotes the stream formed by the combined waters of these two rivers down to its junction with the Paruṣṇī (Ravi), a view accepted by Zimmer. 4) Altindisches Leben, 11, 12. On the other hand, Ludwig 5) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200. thinks that the Marudvṛdhā designates the stream formed by the junction of the Paruṣṇī with the combined waters of the Asiknī and Vitastā, a view which seems less likely.

marka|मर्क
1. Marka is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 27, 20. where Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. He thinks, however, that if the word means ‘eclipse,’ it cannot be derived from the root mṛc, ‘injure.’ sees in the expression sūro markaḥ the ‘eclipse of the sun.’ Sāyaṇa 3) As from the root mṛj, derivation from which is not phonetically justified. thinks the meaning is ‘purifying.’ 4) Ludwig cites this passage, in his essay on eclipses in the Rigveda (Proceedings of the Bohemian Academy, 1885), as a proof that the Vedic Ṛṣis knew of the moon as eclipsing the sun; but see Whitney's reply, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, lxi et seq., and Sūrya.

marka|मर्क
2. Marka is mentioned in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) vi. 4, 10, 1. and elsewhere 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 6, 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 1, 5; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 2, 1, 4. as the Purohita, along with Śaṇḍa, of the Asuras, while Bṛhaspati is, of course, the Purohita of the gods. Marka is mentioned elsewhere also. 3) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vii. 16, 17. The name may quite possibly have Iranian affinities, as believed by Hillebrandt 4) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 442 et seq. and by Hopkins. 5) Cf. Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 49, n. 1. Hillebrandt 6) Op. cit., 1, 223 et seq. also sees in a Gṛdhra mentioned in the Rigveda 7) v. 77, 1. and elsewhere 8) Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iv. 29; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 9, 19. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 279 et seq. a prototype of Marka.

मर्कट,<BR> ‘ape,’ is enumerated in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 11, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 11; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 30. It is classified in the same Saṃhitās 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 4, 5, 7; Maitāyani Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 7. with man and the elephant as ‘taking hold by the hand’ (hastādāna) instead of ‘taking hold by the mouth’ (mukhādāna).

marya|मर्य
2. Marya 1) vii. 56, 16; viii. 43, 25. in several passages of the Rigveda 1) vii. 56, 16; viii. 43, 25. denotes a ‘stallion.’ 2) This is, of course, only a specialized sense of 1. Marya as meaning a ‘male’ (cf. Lat. mas, maritus). The specialized meaning is somewhat analogous to the use of ‘sire’ in English. It is once 3) Rv. ix. 97, 18. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2, thinks Rv. i. 91, 13, may have the same sense. described as pastyāvant, ‘a stalled horse’--that is, one carefully tended, and not allowed out to graze.

maryaka|मर्यक
मर्यक,<BR> occurring only once in the Rigveda, 1) v. 2. 5. Cf. Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 313. seems to denote the bull which is described as separated from the cows.

Usually the word is metaphorically employed. 2) Rv. iv. 5, 13; x. 5, 6; Av. vi. 81, 2 (of an amulet). In the Atharvaveda passage Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 392, suggests, owing to the very curious use of the word, the emendation marya-dā, ‘giver of a son.’

mala|मल
मल<BR> in one passage of the Rigveda 1) x. 136, 2. is used of the garments of the Munis. The St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it to mean a ‘leathern garment,’ 2) If this were correct, the word might be derived from mlā in the sense of ‘to tan.’ Cf. Carman, especially notes 6 and 7. but Ludwig and Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 262. think it means only ‘soiled’ raiment, which, of course, suits the ordinary sense of the word (‘dirt’) in the Atharvaveda, 4) vi. 115, 3; vii. 89, 3; x. 5, 24, etc. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 333, n. and the character of the long-haired (keśin) hermit (Muni). Cf. Malaga. 

malaga|मलग
मल-ग<BR> in one passage of the Atharvaveda 1) xii. 3, 21. denotes a cleanser of clothes, a ‘washerman,’ but the origin of the word is somewhat uncertain. 2) It may, perhaps, have primarily meant ‘concerned with dirt.’ See the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. ga 1, on the use of ga as forming compounds; and cf.

mahaaraatra|महारात्र
महा-रात्र,<BR> ‘advanced night,’ is a phrase found in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 1) ii. 9; xi. 8. and the Sūtras 2) Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, vi. 2, 1; xvii. 7, 1, etc. to denote the latter part of the night, after midnight and before dawn.

mahaarNava|महार्णव
महार्णव,<BR> a ‘great ocean,’ is a phrase not found before the late Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad (i. 4), where the drying up of ‘great oceans’ is one of the marvels enumerated. Cf. Samudra.

mahaavRSha|महावृष
महा-वृष<BR> is the name of a tribe mentioned along with the Mūjavants in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 22, 4, 5, 8. as a locality to which fever is to be relegated. It is reasonable to suppose that they were northerners, though Bloomfield 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 446. suggests that the name may be chosen more for its sound and sense (as ‘of mighty strength’ to resist the disease) than for its geographical position. In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 3) iv. 2, 5. the place Raikvaparṇa is said to be in the Mahāvṛṣa country. The king of the Mahāvṛṣas in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 4) iii. 40, 2. is said to be Hṛtsvāśaya. The Mahāvṛṣas are also known from a Mantra in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra. 5) ii. 5. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 70, 147; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 129; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 259, 260.

mahaashaala|महाशाल
1. Mahā-śāla (lit., ‘having a great house’), a ‘great householder,’ is an expression applied in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (v. 11, 1) to the Brahmins who were instructed by Aśvapati, no doubt to emphasize their importance. Cf. Mahābrāhmaṇa.

mahaashaalajaabaala|महाशालजाबाल
2. Mahā-śāla Jābāla is the name of a teacher twice mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, once as instructing Dhīra Śātaparṇeya, 1) x. 3, 3, 1. and once as one of the Brahmins who received instruction from Aśvapati. 2) x. 6, 1, 1. In the parallel passage of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 3) v. 11, 1. the name is Prācīnaśāla Aupamanyava. 4) Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 393, n. 1. The word must be considered a proper name rather than an adjective (1. Mahāśāla), as it is taken in the St. Petersburg Dictionary. 5) In Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad, i. 1, 3, the word is used of Śaunaka, perhaps merely as an epithet. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 161.

mahaasuparNa|महासुपर्ण
महा-सुपर्ण<BR> in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xii. 2, 3, 7) denotes a ‘great bird’ or ‘great eagle.’

Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, ix. 7; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 1, 12; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 234, 235; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 57, n. 3. Cf.

Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 115; 390; Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 27. Cf. Kṣudra-sūkta.

He is several times referred to in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 1) ii. 1, 8; 3, 7. but not as its author. He is credited with a life of 116 years in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 2) iii. 16, 7. and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 3) iv. 2, 11 (cf. Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 246). Cf. Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 16, 17.

महिष,<BR> the ‘strong,’ with 1) Rv. viii. 58, 15; ix. 92, 6; 96, 6; x. 123, 4. or without 2) Rv. v. 29, 7; vi. 67, 11; viii. 12, 8; 66, 10; ix. 87, 7; x. 28, 10; 189, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 28, etc. Mṛga, ‘wild beast,’ denotes the ‘buffalo’ in the Rigveda and the later texts. The feminine, Mahiṣī, is found in the later Saṃhitās. 3) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxv. 6; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 8, 5; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 7, 11.

mahiShii|महिषी
1. Mahiṣī. See Mahiṣa.

mahiShii|महिषी
2. Mahiṣī, ‘the powerful one,’ the name of the first of the four wives (see Pati) of the king, is mentioned frequently in the later literature. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 9, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 4; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 5; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xix. 1, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 5, 3, 1; vii. 5, 1, 6, etc. Perhaps even in the Rigveda 2) v. 2, 2; 37, 3. the technical sense of ‘first wife’ is present.

mahaitareya|महैतरेय
महैतरेय<BR> is the title of a Vedic text according to the Gṛhya Sūtras of the Ṛgveda. 1) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 4, 4; of a teacher, in Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 10; vi. 1. Cf. Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 39; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 29, 3, 4.

mahoxa|महोक्ष
महोक्ष,<BR> a ‘great bull,’ is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (iii. 4, 1, 2).

maaMsa|मांस
मांस,<BR> ‘flesh.’ The eating of flesh appears as something quite regular in the Vedic texts, which show no trace of the doctrine of Ahiṃsā, or abstaining from injury to animals. For example, the ritual offerings of flesh contemplate that the gods will eat it, and again the Brahmins ate the offerings. 1) So Agni is called ‘eater of ox and cow’ in Rv. viii. 43, 11 = Av. iii. 21, 6 = Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 3, 14, 7; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 280, 281; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 355. Again, the slaying of a ‘great ox’ (mahokṣa) or a ‘great goat’ (mahāja) for a guest was regularly prescribed; 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 1, 2. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, ii. 15, 2. and the name Atithigva probably means ‘slaying cows for guests.’ 3) Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 17, 426; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, cxxiv. Cf. atithinīr gāḥ, ‘cows fit for guests,’ Rv. x. 68, 3. The great sage Yājñavalkya was wont to eat the meat of milch cows and bullocks (dhenv-anaḍuha) if only it was aṃsala (‘firm’ or ‘tender’). 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 2, 21. The sense of aṃsala is given as sthūla, firm,’ in the scholiast. Cf. Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, vii. 2, 23-25. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 11, has tender.’ ‘Off the shoulder’ (aṃsa) is also a possible version. The slaughter of a hundred bulls (ukṣan) was credited to one sacrificer, Agastya. 5) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 11, 1; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxi. 14, 5. The marriage ceremony was accompanied by the slaying of oxen, clearly for food. 6) Q.v. x. 85, 13. Cf. Winternitz, Das altindische Hochzeitsrituell, 33. That there was any general objection to the eating of flesh is most improbable. Sometimes it is forbidden, as when a man is performing a vow, 7) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ii. 1, 8. So a Brahmacārin is not to eat flesh. See Oldenberg, op. cit., 468, n. 3. The blood of an animal is always a somewhat mysterious and dangerous substance; hence taboos on meat-eating, which in another form arise from fear of the spirits of the dead (cf. Oldenberg, op. cit., 414, n. 1). See also Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1, 1, 29; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 588, n. 4. or its use is disapproved, as in a passage of the Atharvaveda, 8) vi. 70, 1. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 493. where meat is classed with Surā, or intoxicating liquor, as a bad thing. Again, in the Rigveda 9) x. 85, 13. In the Atharvaveda, xiv. 1, 13, the ordinary word Maghās is found, and is, no doubt, really to be preferred. See Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1894, 807. the slaying of the cows is said to take place in the Aghās, a deliberate variation for Maghās; but this may be the outcome merely of a natural association of death with gloom, even when cows alone are the victims in question. The Brāhmaṇas also contain the doctrine of the eater in this world being eaten in the next, 10) Cf. the story of Bhṛgu Vāruṇi in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 6, 1, 1 et seq.; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 42-44; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 1, 2, with Keith's notes (pp. 202, 203). but this is not to be regarded as a moral or religious disapproval of eating flesh, though it no doubt contains the germ of such a view, which is also in harmony with the persuasion of the unity of existence, which becomes marked in the Brāhmaṇas. But Ahiṃsā as a developed and articulate doctrine would seem to have arisen from the acceptance of the doctrine of transmigration, which in its fundamentals is later than the Brāhmaṇa period. 11) Cf. Deussen, Philosophy of the Upanishads, 317 et seq.; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 565. On the other hand, it is to be noted that the cow was on the road to acquire special sanctity in the Rigveda, 12) viii. 101, 15. 16; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iv. 19, 20; Av. x. 10; xii. 4, 5; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 151. as is shown by the name aghnyā, 13) Found sixteen times in the Rigveda, as opposed to three instances of Aghnya (masculine); Macdonell, loc. cit. The sense of ‘hard to overcome,’ preferred by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, to that of ‘not to be killed,’ is, however, quite possible. Weber, op. cit., 17, 281, tries to derive the word from ahanya, ‘bright-coloured like dya,’ a derivation that must be regarded as illegitimate. ‘not to be slain,’ applied to it in several passages. But this fact cannot be regarded as showing that meat eating generally was condemned. Apart from mythical considerations, such as the identification of the cow with earth or Aditi (which are, of course, much more than an effort of priestly ingenuity), the value of the cow for other purposes than eating was so great as to account adequately for its sanctity, the beginnings of which can in fact be traced back to Indo-Iranian times. 14) Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 68. Moreover, the ritual of the cremation of the dead required the slaughter of a cow as an essential part, the flesh being used to envelope the dead body. 15) Rv. x. 16, 7. See Oldenberg, op. cit., 576. The usual food of the Vedic Indian, as far as flesh was concerned, can be gathered from the list of sacrificial victims: what man ate he presented to the gods--that is, the sheep, the goat, and the ox. The horse sacrifice was an infrequent exception: it is probably not to be regarded as a trace of the use of horseflesh as food, though the possibility of such being the case cannot be overlooked in view of the widespread use of horseflesh as food in different countries and times. It is, however, more likely that the aim of this sacrifice was to impart magic strength, the speed and vigour of the horse, to the god and his worshippers, as Oldenberg 16) Religion des Veda, 356, n. 4. As to meat-eating in Buddhist times, cf. the death of the Buddha from a meal of pork, Fleet, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1906, 881, 882; Oldenberg, Buddha,^5 231, n. 2 (contra Neumann, Die Reden des Gotamo Buddho, 1, xix). As to meat-eating in the Epic, see Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 119, 120; Great Epic of India, 377-379; and see for modern instances Jolly, Deutsche Rundschau, July, 1884. 118; Bühler, Report, 23.

Thus little is heard of the maternal uncle in the Vedic period: it is not till the Epic 2) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 141. that traces appear of his prominence as compared with the paternal uncle (pitṛvya). This fact is significant for the ‘patriarchal’ character of the early Indian family organization. 3) Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 484, 586-588. Cf. also Rivers, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 629 et seq.

It remains only to add that details are given in the Sūtras 5) Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 460, 476, 477. of the respectful attention paid to a mother, and of the ceremonies in which she is concerned. The mother also appears interested in the fate of her children as in the story of the sale of Śunaḥśepa for adoption by Viśvāmitra in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 6) vii. 18 seq. Cf. also Leist, Altarisches Jus Gentium, 104; Jolly, Die Adoption in Indien, 16, 17. In the household the mother ranked after the father (see Pitṛ).

Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 107; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 135. Agastya must be meant. In another passage, 3) vii. 33, 13. Cf. verse 10. apparently the same meaning applies to Māna--that is, Agastya as ‘a Māna.’ In a third passage 4) i. 117, 11. the expression sūnave Mānena has been held by Sieg 5) Loc. cit. to be an inversion of Mānasya sūnunā, ‘by the son of Māna’--i.e., Agastya; but it seems more likely 6) Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, loc. cit. that either sūnor Māna is the fuller form of Agastya's name (‘pride of the son,’ with reference to his high ancestry), or that the son 7) Bergaigne, loc. cit.; Pischel, loc. cit. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., where sūnoḥ is taken as dependent on vājam. of Māna (= Agastya) is alluded to as interested in Viśpalā. The Mānas--that is, the descendants of Māna, are in several passages alluded to as singers. 8) Rv. i. 169, 8; 171, 5; 182, 8; 184, 5. Cf.

The characteristic days (or rather nights) of the month were those of the new moon, Amā-vasyā, ‘home-staying (night),’ and ‘of the full moon,’ Paurṇa-māsī. Two hymns of the Atharvaveda 1) vii. 79 and 80. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 5, 1, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, 5, 13, etc. celebrate these days respectively. A personification of the phases of the moon is seen in the four names Sinīvālī, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 8, 1;  iii. 4, 9, 1; Rv. ii. 32, 6; Av. ii. 26, 2; vi. 11, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 55. 56; xxxiv. 10; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 8; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 6. the day before new moon; Kuhū, 3) Av. vii. 47; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 8, 1; iii. 4, 9, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 8, etc. also called Guṅgū, 4) Rv. ii. 32, 8, where Sāyaṇa identifies it with Kuhū. the new moon day; Anumati, 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 8, 1; iii. 4, 9, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxix. 60; xxxiv. 8, 9; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 6. the day before full moon; and Rākā, 6) Rv. ii. 32, 4; v. 42, 12; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 8, 1; iii. 4, 9, 1.

The importance of the new and full moon days is seen in the Darśa-pūrṇamāsau, or festivals of the new and full moon days respectively. One special day in the month, the Ekāṣṭakā, or eighth day after full moon, was important. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 7) x. 3, 11. Cf. Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 2, 2, 23; Av. xv. 16, 2. there are stated to be in the year twelve such, mentioned between the twelve days of full moon and the twelve days of new moon. But one Ekāṣṭakā is referred to in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās and elsewhere 8) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 8, 1; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 9, 1. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 3, 8, 4; iv. 3, 11, 3; v. 7, 2, 2; Av. iii. 10; viii. 9, 10; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxix. 10; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 13, 21, etc. See Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 1, 2, with the commentary; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit., with Sāyaṇa's notes; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 341, 342; Indische Studien, 17, 219 et seq. as of quite special importance. This was, in the accordant opinion of most commentators, the eighth day after the full moon of Māgha. It marked the end of the year, or the beginning of the new year. Though the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 9) xix. 23. places the winter solstice in the new moon of Māgha, the latter date probably means the new moon preceding full moon in Māgha, 10) So Vināyaka on Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit.; Ānartīya on Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 19, 1; Weber, op. cit., 2, 345, 346, 353, 354. Weber accepts the scholiasts’ view that Māgha is here regarded as beginning with the day after full moon in Taiṣa; but it is simpler to suppose the meaning to be that Māgha is regarded as commencing with, not after, the new moon and ending with the day before new moon. Several passages in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (ii. 12; iii. 1; xxvi. 18; xxx. 3; see Caland, U7ber das vituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 36, 37) and Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, i. 3; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 1, 1, 7, point to the full moon being the middle of the month, and the new moon being regarded as either the beginning or the end. Hopkins (n. 11) thinks Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, v. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 2, 2, 18, point to the commencement of the month with the full moon. If this could be accepted, then the Aṣṭakā would fall a week before the winter solstice in Māgha. not the new moon following full moon; but it is perhaps possible to account adequately for the importance of the Ekāṣṭakā as being the first Aṣṭakā after the beginning of the new year. It is not certain exactly how the month was reckoned, whether from the day after new moon to new moon--the system known as amānta, or from the day after full moon to full moon--the pūrṇimānta system, which later, at any rate, was followed in North India, while the other system prevailed in the south. Jacobi 11) Zeitschrfit der Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 49, 229, n. 1; 50, 81. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 24, 20. argues that the year began in the full moon of Phālguna, and that only by the full moon's conjunction with the Nakṣatra could the month be known. Oldenberg 12) Ibid., 48, 633, n. 1; 49, 476, 477. This is the Epic rule, Hopkins, loc. cit. points to the fact that the new moon is far more distinctively an epoch than the full moon; that the Greek, Roman, and Jewish years began with the new moon; and that the Vedic evidence is the division of the month into the former (pūrva) and latter (apara) halves, the first being the bright (śukla), the second the dark (kṛṣṇa) period. Thibaut 13) Indian Antiquary, 24, 87. None of the evidence is absolutely conclusive one way or the other. It is perfectly possible that the usage of families or districts differed. Cf. Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 12. considers that to assume the existence of the pūrṇimānta system for the Veda is unnecessary, though possible. Weber 10) So Vināyaka on Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit.; Ānartīya on Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 19, 1; Weber, op. cit., 2, 345, 346, 353, 354. Weber accepts the scholiasts’ view that Māgha is here regarded as beginning with the day after full moon in Taiṣa; but it is simpler to suppose the meaning to be that Māgha is regarded as commencing with, not after, the new moon and ending with the day before new moon. Several passages in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (ii. 12; iii. 1; xxvi. 18; xxx. 3; see Caland, U7ber das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 36, 37) and Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, i. 3; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 1, 1, 7, point to the full moon being the middle of the month, and the new moon being regarded as either the beginning or the end. Hopkins (n. 11) thinks Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, v. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 2, 2, 18, point to the commencement of the month with the full moon. If this could be accepted, then the Aṣṭakā would fall a week before the winter solstice in Māgha. assumes that it occurs in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa as held by the scholiasts. But it would probably be a mistake to press that passage, or to assume that the amānta system was rigidly accepted in the Veda: it seems at least as probable that the month was vaguely regarded as beginning with the new moon day, so that new moon preceded full moon, which was in the middle, not the end or the beginning of the month. That a month regularly had 30 days is established by the conclusive evidence of numerous passages in which the year is given 12 months and 360 days. This month is known from the earliest records, being both referred to directly and alluded to. 14) Rv. i. 164, 11. 14, 48; x. 189, 3; 190, 2; Av. iv. 35, 4; x. 7, 6; 8, 23; xiii. 3, 8, etc. It is the regular month of the Brāhmaṇas, 15) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 10, 8; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 12; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvi. 2, 3; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 2, 1; Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxvi. 10; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 5, 22. See also Weber, Naxatra, 2, 288; Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 8. and must be regarded as the month which the Vedic Indian recognized. No other month is mentioned as such in the Brāhmaṇa literature; it is only in the Sūtras that months of different length occur. The Sāmaveda Sūtras 16) Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 8, 1 et seq.; Nidāna Sūtra, v. 11. 12; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 281-288. refer to (1) years with 324 days--i.e., periodic years with 12 months of 27 days each; (2) years with 351 days--i.e., periodic years with 12 months of 27 days each, plus another month of 27 days; (3) years with 354 days--i.e., 6 months of 30 days, and 6 with 29 days, in other words, lunar synodic years; (4) years with 360 days, or ordinary civil (sāvana) years; (5) years with 378 days, which, as Thibaut 17) Op. cit., 8, 9. clearly shows, are third years, in which, after two years of 360 days each, 18 days were added to bring about correspondence between the civil year and the solar year of 366 days. But even the Sāmasūtras do not mention the year of 366 days, which is first known to the Jyotiṣa 18) verse 28. and to Garga. 19) Cited in the commentary on the Jyotiṣa, 10. That the Vedic period was acquainted with the year of 354 days cannot be affirmed with certainty. Zimmer, 20) Altindisches Leben, 365, 366. indeed, thinks that it is proved by the fact that pregnancy is estimated at ten months, or sometimes a year. 21) Ten months is the period according to Rv. v. 78, 7-9; x. 184, 3; Av. i. 11, 6; iii. 23, 2; v. 25, 13; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxviii. 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5, 2, 4. 5 (ibid., ix. 5, 1, 63, a six months' embryo is alone able to live). A year is mentioned in Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, x. 1, 9 (ten months in vi. 1, 3); Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiii. 8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1, 3, 8; xi. 5, 4, 6-11; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 22. But Weber 22) Naxatra, 2, 313, n. 1. may be right in holding that the month is the periodic month of 27 days, for the period is otherwise too long if a year is taken. On the other hand, the period of ten months quite well suits the period of gestation, if birth takes place in the tenth month, so that in this sense the month of 30 days may well be meant. The year of 12 months of 30 days each being admittedly quite unscientific, Zimmer 23) Op. cit., 369, 370. is strongly of opinion that it was only used with a recognition of the fact that intercalation took place, and that the year formed part of a greater complex, normally the five your Yuga or cycle. This system is well known from the Jyotṣa: it consists of 62 months of 29(16/31) days each = 1, 830 days (two of these months being intercalary, one in the middle and one at the end), or 61 months of 30 days, or 60 months of 30(1/2) days, the unit being clearly a solar year of 366 days. It is not an ideal system, since the year is too long; 24) The Yuga is too long by nearly four days. The true year has 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 46 seconds. Cf. Thibaut, op. cit., 24, 25. but it is one which cannot be claimed even for the Brāhmaṇa period, during which no decision as to the true length of the year seems to have been arrived at. The references to it seen by Zimmer in the Rigveda 25) i. 164, 14; iii. 55, 18. These passages are, of course, obscure, but to interpret them as referring to the ten half years of the Yuga is particularly gratuitous. are not even reasonably plausible, while the pañcaka yuga, cited by him from the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 26) xvii. 13, 17. See also Thibaut, op. cit., 7, 8; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 91, and references. The most that can be said is that a tendency to accept five years as a convenient period for intercalation was arising, which ultimately appears developed in the Jyotiṣa. But we cannot say that a year of 366 days is known until then. occurs only in a quotation in a commentary, and had no authority for the text itself. On the other hand, there was undoubtedly some attempt to bring the year of 360 days--a synodic lunar year--roughly into connexion with reality. A Sāmasūtra 27) Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 8, has nothing of this, but Nidāna Sūtra, v. 12, 2, 5, is quite clear. treats it as a solar year, stating that he sun perambulates each Naxatra in 13(1/3) days, while others again evidently interpolated 18 days every third year, in order to arrive at some equality. But Vedic literature, from the Rigveda 28) i. 25, 8; perhaps 165, 15. downwards, 29) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 3, 1, 5; vi. 2, 2, 29; xii. 2, 1, 8; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 12; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 13; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, x. 3, 2; xxiii. 2, 3; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, v. 4, 29; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 336, n. 1. teems with the assertion of the difficulty of ascertaining the month. The length is variously given as 30 days, 30) Av. xiii. 3, 8. 35 days, 31) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 5, 4, 5. or 36 days. 32) Ibid., ix. 1, 1, 43; 3, 3, 18. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 167, n. 1. Shamasastry, Gavām Ayana, 122, interprets these passages in quite an impossible manner. There is no trace of a month of 35-36 days in the Epic: Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 24, 42. The last number possibly indicates an intercalation after six years (6×6 = 36, or for ritual purposes 35), but for this we have no special evidence. There are many references 33) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 7, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxi. 5; xxxiv. 9; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 10, 8; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, v. 8; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, i. 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 3, 27; iii. 6, 4, 24; v. 4, 5, 23; vii. 2, 3, 9, etc.; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 10, 6. to the year having 12 or 13 months. The names of the months are, curiously enough, not at all ancient. The sacrificial texts of the Yajurveda give them in their clearest form where the Agnicayana, ‘building of the fire-altar,’ is described. 34) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 11, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 10; xxxv. 9; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 8, 12; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 25; xiv. 6. 15. 16 27; xv. 57. These names are the following: (1) Madhu, (2) Mādhava (spring months, vāsantikāv ṛtū); (3) Śukra, (4) Śuci (summer months, graiṣmāv ṛtū); (5) Nabha (or Nabhas), 35) In Maitrāyaṇī, Kāṭhaka, and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitās. See notes 34, 36. (6) Nabhasya (rainy months, vārṣikāv ṛtū); (7) Iṣa, (8) Ūrja (autumn months, śāradāv ṛtū); (9) Saha (or Sahas), 35) In Maitrāyaṇī, Kāṭhaka, and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitās. See notes 34, 36. (10) Sahasya (winter months, haimantikāv ṛtū); (11) Tapa (or Tapas), 35) In Maitrāyaṇī, Kāṭhaka, and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitās. See notes 34, 36. (12) Tapasya (cool months, śaiśirāv ṛtū). There are similar lists in the descriptions of the Soma sacrifice 36) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 4, 14, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 3, 16; iv. 6, 7; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, iv. 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vii. 30 (where Iṣ and Ūrj appear as the names of the months). and of the horse sacrifice, 37) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 12, 13; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 31. all of them agreeing in essentials. There are other lists of still more fanciful names, 38) See, e.g., Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 7, 9, 1; iv. 7, 11, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā ix. 20; xviii. 28; xxii. 32; Kāthaka Saṃhitā, xxxv. 10, Weber, 2, 349, 350. but these have no claim at all to represent actual divisions in popular use. It is doubtful if the list given above is more than a matter of priestly invention. Weber points out that Madhu and Mādhava later appear as names of spring, and that these two are mentioned in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 39) iv. 7, 2; v. 6, 16. as if actually employed; but the evidence is very inadequate to show that the other names of the months given in the list were in ordinary use. 40) Cases like that of nabhas, used by Mallinātha on Meghadūta, i. 4, are merely scholastic. In some of these lists the intercalary month is mentioned. The name given to it in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 41) vii. 30; xxii. 31. is Aṃhasaspati, while that given in the Taittirīya 42) i. 4, 14, 1. and Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitās 43) iii. 12, 13. is Saṃsarpa. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 44) xxxviii. 4. gives it the name of Malimluca, which also occurs elsewhere, along with Saṃsarpa, in one of the lists of fanciful names. 45) Ibid., xxxv. 10; Vājasaneyi Saṃitā, xxii. 30. The Atharvaveda 46) v. 6, 4. describes it as sanisrasa, ‘slipping,’ owing no doubt to its unstable condition. The other method of naming the months is from the Nakṣatras. It is only beginning to be used in the Brāhmaṇas, but is found regularly in the Epic and later. The Jyotiṣa 47) Verse 6 Yajus recension = verse 5 Ṛc recension: Weber, 2, 354 et seq. mentions that Māgha and Tapa were identical: this is the fair interpretation of the passage, which also involves the identification of Madhu with Caitra, a result corresponding with the view frequently found in the Brāhmaṇas, that the full moon in Citrā, and not that in Phalgunī, is the beginning of the year. 48) Weber's theory (359) that Caitra was as the first spring month secondary to Phālguna is, of course, an error; for, owing to the precession of the equinoxes, Phālguna became the first month of spring de facto, while Caitra became virtually the last month of the preceding season. The truth is that the six seasons are an arbitrary division of the year, and that either Phālguna or Caitra could be regarded as the beginning of spring without much impropriety. See Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 457; 10, 231, 232; Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 8, 71, 397, 398. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 49) viii. 4, 2, 12; 3, 18. See Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 26. 31. The Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 10, 3, has the words in the form of yāva and ayāva, which are explained in v. 3, 4, 5. are found two curious expressions, yava and ayava, for the light and dark halves of the month, which is clearly considered to begin with the light half. Possibly the words are derived, as Eggling 50) Sacred Books of the East, 43, 69, n. thinks, from yu, ‘ward off,’ with reference to evil spirits. The word Parvan (‘joint’ = division of time) probably 51) The months and the half months are the parvāṇi of the sacrificial horse in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 1, 1. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 35; vi. 2, 2, 24; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 43; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 4, where the sense is left vague. denotes a half of the month, perhaps already in the Rigveda. 52) i. 94, 4. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 189. More precisely the first half, the time of the waxing light, is called pūrva-pakṣa, 53) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 9, 6; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 25, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 7, 4, 7; viii. 4, 2, 11; Nirukta, v. 11,; xi. 5. 6. the second, that of the waning light, apara-pakṣa, 54) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 7, 4, 7; viii. 4, 2, 11; xi. 1, 5, 3; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 1, 5; Nirukta, v. 11; xi. 6, etc. Either of these might be called a half-month (ardha-māsa). 55) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 5, 21; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 1, 1; iii. 8, 9 etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 15, 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 12, 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 28.

मित्र-वर्चस् स्थैरकायण<BR> (‘descendant of Sthiraka’) is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Supratīta Auluṇḍya, in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372.

mitravindakaashyapa|मित्रविन्दकाश्यप
मित्र-विन्द काश्यप<BR> (‘descendant of Kaśyapa’) is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Sunītha, in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372.

mitraatithi|मित्रातिथि
मित्रातिथि<BR> is mentioned in one hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 33, 7. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 150, 184; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 922, 923; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 384; Bṛhaddevatā, vii. 35, 36, with Macdonell's notes. as the father of Kuruśravaṇa and the grandfather of Upamaśravas, all being evidently kings.

muxiijaa|मुक्षीजा
मुक्षीजा<BR> is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 125, 2; Nirukta, v. 19. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 244. where the sense seems clearly to be ‘net’ for catching animals. Cf. Padi.

munja|मुञ्ज
1. Muñja denotes a grass, the Saccharum Muñja, which is of luxuriant growth, attaining to a height of ten feet. It is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 191, 3. along with other kinds of grasses as the lurking-place of venomous creatures. In the same text 2) i. 161, 8 (muñja-nejana, which Sāyaṇa explains as apagata-tṛṇa, ‘with the grass removed’). the Muñja grass is spoken of as purifying, apparently being used as the material of a filter for Soma. The grass is often mentioned in the later Saṃhitās 3) Av. i. 2, 4; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 9, 5; 10, 5, etc. and the Brāhmaṇas. 4) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xviii. 7; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 3, 3, 16; vi. 6, 1, 23; 2, 15. 16, etc. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. mauñja. It is in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5) vi. 3, 1, 26. said to be ‘hollow’ (suṣira) and to be used for the plaited part of the throne (Āsandī). 6) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 8, 3, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72. 

munjasaamashravasa|मुञ्जसामश्रवस
2. Muñja Sāma-śravasa (‘descendant of Sāmaśravas’) is the name of a man, possibly a king, mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 1) iii. 5, 2. and the Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 2) iv. 1 (Indische Studien, 1, 39).

muNDibhaaudanya|मुण्डिभऔदन्य
मुण्डिभ औदन्य<BR> 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 5, 4. Apparently the word is a patronymic, ‘son of Udanya’ (so Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 341, n. 1), or ‘son of Odana’ (so St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.). or Audanyava 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 9, 15, 3 (‘descendant of Udanyu’). is the name of a man in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 5, 4. Apparently the word is a patronymic, ‘son of Udanya’ (so Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 341, n. 1), or ‘son of Odana’ (so St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.). and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 9, 15, 3 (‘descendant of Udanyu’).

mudga|मुद्ग
मुद्ग,<BR> denoting a kind of bean (Phascolus Mungo), occurs in a list of vegetables in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 1) xviii. 12. A ‘soup of rice with beans’ (mudgaudana) is mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 2) xii. 8. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 240. and the Sūtras. Cf. perhaps Mudgala.

mudgala|मुद्गल
मुद्गल<BR> and Mudgalanī, ‘Mudgala's wife,’ both figure in a hopelessly obscure hymn of the Rigveda, 1) x. 102. variously interpreted by Pischel 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 124. and Geldner 3) Ibid., 1, 138; 2, 1-22. and von Bradke 4) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 46, 445 et seq. as telling of a real chariot race in which, despite difficulties, Mudgala won by his wife's aid. The Indian tradition is as variant as the interpretations of modern authorities. Ṣaḍguruśiṣya 5) Macdonell's edition of the Sarvānukramaṇī, p. 158. explains that Mudgala's oxen were stolen, that he pursued the thieves with the one old ox he had left, and that hurling his hammer (dru-ghaṇa) he caught the marauders. Yāska, 6) Nirukta, ix. 23, 24. on the other hand, says that Mudgala won a race with a drughaṇa and an ox instead of with two oxen. It is pretty clear that, as Roth 7) Nirukta, Erlänterungen, 129. observed, the tradition is merely a guess, and a bad one, at the meaning of an obscure hymn, and this view is accepted by Oldenberg. 8) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 39, 78. Bloomfield 9) Ibid., 48, 547. has interpreted the legend as one of heavenly, not of human, events. Mudgala, probably a variant form of Mudgara, 10) According to Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 1, Indrasenā in x. 102, 2, is the name of Mudgalānī; but its sense, ‘Indra's bolt,’ rather indicates the mythical character of the passage. which in the later language means a hammer or a similar weapon, may be meant as a personfication of the thunderbolt of Indra, rather than a real man. 11) If the name means a real man, it may be connected with Mudga, ‘bean.’ See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 240. Later 12) Av. iv. 29, 6; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 12; Bṛhaddevatā, vi. 46; viii. 12. 90. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166, 167; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 280; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 1911, 1005, n. 1. Mudgala is a mythical sage.

muni|मुनि
मुनि<BR> occurs in one hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 136, 2. 4. 5. In verse I he is described as ‘long-haired.’ where it seems to denote an ascetic of magic powers with divine afflatus (deveṣita), the precursor of the strange ascetics of later India. This agrees with the fact that Aitaśa, the Muni, is in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 2) vi. 33, 3. regarded by his son as deranged, a view not unjustified if the nonsense which passes as the Aitaśapralāpa. 3) See Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 98 et seq. ‘Chatter of Aitaśa,’ was really his. The Rigveda 4) viii. 17, 14. Cf. vii. 56, 8; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 376. calls Indra the ‘friend of Munis,’ and the Atharvaveda 5) vii. 74, 1. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 440; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ix. 5, 2, 15, and Munimaraṇa. refers to a ‘divine Muni’ (deva muni), by whom a similar ascetic may be meant. In the Upaniṣads 6) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 4, 1; iv. 4, 25; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 20. the Muni is of a more restrained type: he is one who learns the nature of the Brahman, the Absolute, by study, or sacrifice, or penance, or fasting, or faith (śraddhā). It must not of course be thought that there is any absolute distinction between the older Muni and the later: in both cases the man is in a peculiar ecstatic condition, but the ideal of the Upaniṣads is less material than the earlier picture of the Muni, who is more of a ‘medicine man’ than a sage. Nor would it be wise to conclude from the comparative rareness of the mention of the Muni in the Vedic texts that he was an infrequent figure in Vedic times: he was probably not approved by the priests who followed the ritual, and whose views were essentially different from the ideals of a Muni, which were superior to earthly considerations, such as the desire for children and Dakṣiṇās. 7) Cf. {|Bṛhadāranyaka|} Upaniṣad, iii. 4, 1. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 406; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 49, 480; Buddha,^5 36.

munimaraNa|मुनिमरण
मुनि-मरण,<BR> ‘Saints’ Death,’ is the name of the place where, according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 4, 7), the Vaikhanasas were slain.

mulaalin|मुलालिन्
मुलालिन्<BR> (masc.) or Mulālī (fem.) is the name of some part of an edible lotus (perhaps the Nymphaea esculenta) in the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 34. 5. Cf. Kauśika Sūtra, lxvi. 10; Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 138; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 207.

muShiivan|मुषीवन्
मुषीवन्<BR> denotes ‘robber’ in one passage of the Rigveda (i. 42, 3).

muShkara|मुष्कर
मुष्कर<BR> occurs in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 14, 2. possibly in the sense of a small animal or insect, as suggested by Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. who, however, thought the passage corrupt. Bloomfield 3) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 463, 464. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 297. suggests that the reading of the Paippalāda text puṣkaram, (‘blue lotus’) is the correct form.

muShTihan|मुष्टिहन्
मुष्टि-हन्,<BR> 1) Rv. v. 58, 4; vi. 26, 2; viii. 20, 20; Av. v. 22, 4. Muṣṭi-hatyā, 2) Rv. i. 8, 2. in the Rigveda and the Atharvaveda denote. respectively, the ‘hand to hand fighter’--that is, the ordinary warrior as opposed to the charioteer, and the ‘fight’ itself. So also in the Atharvaveda 3) vii. 62, 1. the charioteer (rathin) is opposed to the foot-soldier (patti), and in the Rigveda 4) i. 100, 10. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 297. the chariots are opposed to the troops (grāma) of the infantry. The parallel of the Greek and other Āryan races shows that the Kṣatriyas were the fighters from chariots, while the ordinary host fought on foot.

musala|मुसल
मुसल<BR> denotes a ‘pestle’ in the later Saṃhitās 1) Av. x. 9, 26; xi. 3, 3; xii. 3, 13; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 8, 3, etc. and in the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 5, 2, 7; in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 42, 44 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 235, 237), musalin means a ‘man armed with a club.’

muhuurta|मुहूर्त
मुहूर्त<BR> denotes a division of time, one-thirtieth of a day, or an hour of forty-eight minutes, in the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 1, 1 (for the names); 9, 7; 12, 9, 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 4, 2, 18. 25. 27; 3, 20; xii. 3, 2, 5; x. 4, 4, 4, etc. In the Rigveda 2) iii. 33, 5; 53, 8. The sense of ‘moment’ is also common in the Brāhmaṇas. Cf. Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 9, 139 et seq.; Indische Streifen, 1, 92 et seq. the sense of ‘moment’ only is found. Cf. Ahan.

muuchiipa|मूचीप
मूचीप<BR> or Mūvīpa is the variant in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xv. 26, 6) of the Mūtiba of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa as the name of a barbarian tribe. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 67, n. 1.

muujavant|muujavat|मूजवत्|मूजवन्त्
मूजवन्त्<BR> is the name of a people who, along with the Mahāvṛṣas, the Gandhāris, and the Balhikas, are mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 22, 5, 7, 8. 14. Cf. Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ii. 5. as dwelling far away, and to whom fever is to be banished. Similarly in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 6, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, ix. 7; xxxvi. 14; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 4, 10. 20; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 61; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 2, 17. the Mūjavants are chosen as a type of distant folk, beyond which Rudra with his bow is entreated to depart. In the Rigveda 3) x. 34, 1. Soma is described as Maujavata, ‘coming from the Mūjavants,’ or, as Yāska 4) Nirukta, ix. 8. takes it, ‘from Mount Mūjavant.’ The Indian commentators 5) Mahīdhara on Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit.; Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 161, 8; Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra and Prayoga, cited by Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 63. agree with Yāska in taking Mūjavant as the name of a mountain, and though Hillebrandt 6) Op. cit., 1, 65. is justified in saying that the identification of Mūjavant by Zimmer 7) Altindisches Leben, 29. with one of the lower hills on the south-west of Kaśmīr lacks evidence, it is not reasonable to deny that Mūjavant was a hill from which the people took their name. Yāska 8) Loc. cit. Cf. Siddhānta Kaumudī on Pāṇini, iv. 4, 110, where instead of Maujavata in Rv. x. 34, 1, Mauñjavata is read. suggests that Mūjavant is equivalent to Muñjavant, which actually occurs later, in the Epic, 9) Mahābhārata, x. 785; xiv. 180. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 198. as the name of a mountain in the Himālaya.

muuta|मूत
मूत<BR> in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvi. 14; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 10, 5; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 3, 8. denotes a ‘woven basket.’ Mūtaka means a ‘small basket.’ 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 2, 17.

muutiba|मूतिब
मूतिब<BR> appears in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) vii. 18, 2. as the name of one of the barbarous peoples enumerated as nominally Viśvāmitra's outcast offspring. The Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 2) xv. 26, 6. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 358, 483. gives the name as Mūcīpa or Mūvīpa.

muula|मूल
मूल, मूलबर्हण<BR> See Nakṣatra.

muus|मूस्
मूस्,<BR> 1) Rv. i. 105, 8 = x. 33, 3; Nirukta, iv. 5. Mūṣikā, 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 17; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 36. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 85; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 248. are the names of ‘mouse’ occurring in the Rigveda 1) Rv. i. 105, 8 = x. 33, 3; Nirukta, iv. 5. and the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 17; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 36. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 85; Schrader, Prchistoric Antiquities, 248. 

mRga|मृग
1. Mṛga has the generic sense of ‘wild beast’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 173, 2; 191, 4; viii. 1, 20; 5, 36; x. 146, 6, etc. and later. 2) Av. iv. 3, 6; x. 1, 26; xii. 1, 48 (sūkara, ‘boar’); xix. 38, 2; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vi. 7, 10; xxiv. 11, 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 31, 2; viii. 23, 3, etc. Sometimes it is qualified by the epithet ‘terrible’ (bhīma), 3) Rv. i. 154, 2; 190, 3; ii. 33, 11; 34, 1; x. 180, 2, etc. which indicates that a savage wild beast is meant. Elsewhere the buffalo is shown to be denoted by the epithet mahiṣa, 4) Rv. viii. 69, 15; ix. 92, 6; x. 123, 4. ‘powerful,’ which later becomes the name of the buffalo. More particularly the word has the sense of an animal of the gazelle type. 5) Rv. i. 38, 5; 105, 7; vi. 75, 11; ix. 32, 4; Av. v. 21, 4 (not a certain instance); Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 3, 7; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 5 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 8, 4, 3, etc. In some passages 6) Rv. i. 182, 7; x. 136, 6, and perhaps i. 145, 5; vii. 87, 6. Roth 7) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 1e. Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, i. 99; 2, 122. sees the sense of ‘bird.’ See also Mṛga Hastin, Puruṣa Hastin.

mRga|मृग
2. Mṛga in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) iii. 33, 5. denotes, according to Sāyaṇa's commentary, the constellation Mṛgaśiras. But it seems more probable 2) See Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, xcii. that Mṛga there really covers the whole of Orion, not merely the inconspicuous group of stars in the head of Orion that make up the Nakṣatra Mṛgaśiras, but also the star a in his shoulder, which is reckoned as Ārdrā, and  in his left shoulder. Tilak, 3) Orion, 99 et seq. however, makes Mṛga or Mṛgaśiras into a different group, consisting of the belt of Orion, with two stars in the knees and one in the left shoulder, which he deems to resemble a deer's head with an arrow through it, an implausible and unlikely theory. Cf. Mṛgavyādha.

mRgahastin|मृगहस्तिन्
3. Mṛga Hastin, the ‘animal with a hand,’ is mentioned in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 64, 7; iv. 16, 14. in which Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Nirukta, Erläuterungen, 79. recognizes that the elephant is meant, but concludes that the compound name is a proof of the newness of the elephant to the Vedic Indians. 3) Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 99, 100, combats the view that the eler hant was new to the Vedic Indian, because of the similar use of mṛga mahiṣa and mṛga sūkara (Av. xii. 1, 48) to denote the ‘buffalo’ and the ‘boar’ respectively. But Mahiṣa seems rather to bear out Roth's conclusion; while Sūkara appears alone in the Rigveda, and mṛga sūkara, ‘wild hog,’ seems to be used in one passage of the Av. (xii. 1, 48) to distinguish it from Varāha, ‘boar,’ in the same verse. Later the adjective Hastin alone became the regular name of the animal (like Mahiṣa of the ‘buffalo’). The elephant is also denoted in the Rigveda by the descriptive term Mṛga Vāraṇa, 4) Rv. viii. 33, 8; x. 40, 8. the ‘wild or dangerous animal,’ the adjective vāraṇa similarly becoming one of the names for ‘elephant’ in the later language. Pischel's view 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 121-123; 317319. Cf. Strabo, pp. 704, 705; Arrian, Indica, 13. 14 (from Megasthenes). that the catching of elephants by the use of tame female elephants is already alluded to in the Rigveda 6) viii. 2, 6; x. 40, 8. seems very doubtful. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 7) viii. 23, 3 (hiraṇyena parīvṛtān kṛṣṇāñ chukladato mṛgān). See Pischel, op. cit., 2, 122. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 80. elephants are described as ‘black, white-toothed, adorned with gold.’

mRgaya|मृगय
मृगय<BR> occurs in several passages of the Rigveda 1) iv. 16, 13; viii. 3, 19; x. 49, 5. as defeated by Indra. That he was a human foe, as Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166. thinks, seems unlikely: more probably he was a demon, as Mṛga unquestionably is. 3) Rv. i. 80, 7; v. 29, 4, etc.

mRgayu|मृगयु
मृगयु,<BR> ‘hunter,’ occurs in the later Saṃhitās 1) Av. x. 1, 26; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 27; xxx. 7, etc. Cf. mṛgaṇyu, Rv. x. 40, 4. and the Brāhmaṇas, 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 1, 1; iii. 4, 3, 1; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 9, 12, etc. but not very often. The Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 3) xxx. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 4) iii. 4. however, in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) include a number of names which seem to be those of persons who make a livelihood by fishing or by hunting, such as the Mārgāra, ‘hunter,’ the Kaivarta or Kevarta, Pauñjiṣṭha, Daśa, Maināla, ‘fisher man,’ and perhaps the Bainda and the Ānda, 5) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 16; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 12, 1. who seem to have been some sort of fishermen. It is not probable that even in the earliest Vedic period hunting formed the main source of livelihood for any of the Vedic tribes: pastoral pursuits and agriculture (Kṛṣi) were, no doubt, the mainstay of their existence. But it would be unreasonable to suppose that not much hunting was done, both for recreation and for purposes of food, as well as for protection of flocks from wild beasts. The Rigveda is naturally our chief source of information in regard to hunting. The arrow was sometimes employed, 6) Rv. ii. 42, 2. but, as is usual with primitive man, the normal instruments of capture were nets and pitfalls. Birds were regularly caught in nets (Pāśa, 7) Pāśin, ‘hunter,’ Rv. iii. 45, 1. Nidhā, 8) Rv. ix. 83, 4; x. 73, 11. Jāla), 9) Av. x. 1, 30. The bird-catcher being called nidhā-pati, 10) Rv. ix. 83, 4. ‘master of snares.’ The net was fastened on pegs 11) Av. viii. 8, 5. (as is done with modern nets for catching birds). Another name of net is apparently Mukṣījā. Pits were used for catching antelopes (Ṛśya), and so were called ṛśya-da, 12) Rv. x. 39, 8. ‘antelope-catching.’ Elephants were captured as in Greek times, perhaps through the instrumentality of tame females (see Mṛga Hastin). Apparently the boar was captured in the chase, dogs being used, 13) Rv. x. 86, 4. but the passage from which this view is deduced is of uncertain mythological content. There is also an obscure reference 14) Rv. x. 51, 6. to the capture of the buffalo (Gaura), but it is not clear whether the reference is to shooting with an arrow or capturing by means of ropes, perhaps a lasso, or a net. The lion was captured in pitfalls, 15) Rv. x. 28, 10. or was surrounded by the hunters and slain; 16) Rv. v. 15, 3. one very obscure passage refers to the lion being caught by ambuscade, which perhaps merely alludes to the use of the hidden pit. 17) Rv. v. 74, 4. Cf. Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 542, n. The modes of catching fish are little known, for the only evidence available are the explanations of the various names mentioned in the Yajurveda. Sāyaṇa 18) On Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 12, 1. Cf. Weber, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 18, 281. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 243245. says that Dhaivara is one who takes fish by netting a tank on either side; Dāśa and Śauṣkala do so by means of a fish-hook (baḍiśa); Bainda, Kaivarta, and Maināla by means of a net (jāla); Mārgāra catches fish in the water with his hands; Ānda by putting in pegs at a ford (apparently by building a sort of dam); Parṇaka by putting a poisoned leaf on the water. But none of these explanations can claim much authority.

mRgavyaadha|मृगव्याध
मृग-व्याध,<BR> ‘the hunter,’ is the name of Sirius in the legned of Prajāpati's daughter in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 1) iii. 33, 5. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 205, n. 1, 208, n. 3; Tilak, Orion, 98 et seq.; Sūrya Siddhānta, viii. 10; ix. 12, preserves the name. Prajāpati (Orion) pursues his daughter (Rohiṇī), and is shot by the archer Sirius. The transference of the legend of Prajāpati to the sky is no doubt secondary, caused by the obvious similarity of the constellation in question to the idea of an archer.

mRgashiras|मृगशिरस्
मृग-शिरस्, मृग-शीर्ष<BR> See Nakṣatra, 1. and 2. Mṛga.

mRgaakhara|मृगाखर
मृगाखर<BR> in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (vii. 5, 21, 1) and Brāhmaṇa (iii. 9, 17, 3) denotes the ‘lair of wild beasts.’

mRDa|मृड
मृड<BR> is found only in compounds in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 1) Upacāya-mṛḍaṃ hiraṇyam, Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 1; aṣṭā-mṛḍaṃ hiraṇyam, ibid., xiii. 10; aṣṭā-pruḍ-ḍhiraṇyam, Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 1, 4, etc. where it seems to denote a small weight of gold. It is uncertain whether the reading should not be Pṛda, as in the grammatical tradition. 2) See Pāṇini, iii. 1, 123, with the Vārttika; von Schroeder, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 49, 164.

mRttikaa|मृत्तिका
मृत्तिका,<BR> ‘clay,’ is mentioned in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 13; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 34, 2; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 4; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, x. 1, 8. 9. Cf. Mṛd. 

mRtyu|मृत्यु
मृत्यु,<BR> ‘death,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda 1) vii. 59, 12; x. 13, 4; 18, 1, 2; x. 48, 5; 60, 5. So mṛtyu-bandhu, ‘akin to death,’ Rv. viii. 18, 22; x. 95, 18. and later 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 5, 9, 4, where the world is said to be ‘yoked with death’ (mṛtyu-saṃyuta); Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 9, 6; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 2; 14, 1. 2. 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 6, 5, 1, etc. So often the ‘bonds of death’ (mṛtyu-pāśa), Av. viii. 2, 2; 8, 10. 16; xvii. 1, 30; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 8, 2; Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad, i. 18, etc. as a thing of terror. There are a hundred and one forms of death, the natural one by old age 3) Av. ii. 13, 2; 28, 2. (jarā), and a hundred others, all to be avoided. 4) Av. i. 30, 3; ii. 28, 1; iii. 11, 5; viii. 2, 27; xi. 6, 16, etc. To die before old age (purā jarasaḥ) 5) Rv. viii. 67, 20; Av. v. 30, 17; x. 2, 30; xiii. 3, 56. is to die before the allotted span (purā āyuṣaḥ), 6) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 4, 1. the normal length of life being throughout Vedic literature spoken of as a hundred years. 7) Rv. i. 64, 14; 89, 9; ii. 33, 2, etc. Cf. Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 384; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 193; Festgruss an Reth, 137. On the other hand, the evils of old age in the loss of physical strength were clearly realized. 8) Rv. i. 71, 10; 179, 1. one of the feats of the Aśvins was to restore old Cyavāna to his former youth and powers, and another was the rejuventation of Kali. 9) x. 39, 8. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 243. The Atharvaveda 10) See Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 62 et seq. is full of charms of all sorts to avert death and secure length of years (āyuṣya). The modes of disposing of the dead were burial and cremation (see Agnidagdha). Both existed in the early Vedic period, 11) See Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, clii; Winternitz, Geschichte der indischen Literatur, 1, 84, 85. as in Greece; 12) See Lang, Homer and his Age, 82 et seq.; cf. Burrows, Discoveries in Crete, 209-213. but the former method was on the whole less favoured, and tended to be regarded with disapproval. The bones of the dead, whether burned or not, were marked by the erection of a tumulus (Śmaśāna): the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13) xiii. 8, 2, 1. preserves traces of strong differences of opinion as to the mode in which these tumuli should be constructed. There is little or no trace 14) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 410; Weinhold, Altnordisches Leben, 483 et seq. of the custom common in northern lands of sending the dead man to sea in a burning ship: the reference to a ship 15) Rv. x. 63, 10; 135, 4; Av. vii. 6, 3, and cf. Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1895, 856. seems to point to mythical perils after death, not to the mode of burial. The life after death was to the Vedic Indian a repetition of the life in this world. He passed into the next world sarvatanuḥ sāṅgaḥ, ‘with whole body and all his members,’ 16) Av. v. 6, 11; xviii. 4, 64; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 6, 1, 1; xi. 1, 8, 6; xii. 8, 3, 31, and cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 3, 5, 2; 6, 3; 6, 6, 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 20, 5; 10, 11, 1. enjoying there the same pleasures as he had enjoyed on earth. Even in the Rigveda 17) Rv. ii. 29, 6; iii. 26, 8; iv. 5, 5; 25, 6; vii. 104, 3. 11. 17; x. 152, 4. there are hints of evil awaiting evil-doers, but it is not until the Atharvaveda 18) ii. 14, 3; v. 19, 3; 30, 11; viii. 2, 24; xii. 4, 36; xviii. 3, 3. Cf. also v. 19; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 5. and the Brāhmaṇas 19) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 6, 1, 1 et seq.; Weber, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 9, 240 et seq.; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 42-44 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 236 et seq.). that a hell of punishment is set out, and it is in the Brāhmaṇas 20) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 2, 2, 27; x. 6, 3, 1; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xii. 3, etc. that good and evil deeds are said to produce happiness or hell hereafter. But there is no hint of extinction 21) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 169. in the Rigveda as the fate of the wicked, as Roth 22) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 3, 329-347; Weber, op. cit., 238 et seq. inclined to think. The Vedic poet not being deeply moral, his verses do not convey, as would those of a man convinced of sin, warnings of future judgment.

mRd|मृद्
मृद्<BR> denotes ‘clay’ in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 7, 9, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 55. and the Brāhmaṇas 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1, 1, 13; 2, 34; 3, 3; 3, 1, 22, 32; 3, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad vi. 27, etc. (cf. Mṛttikā). A ‘lump of clay’ also occurs in the Brāhmaṇas, 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 4, 2, 1; 5, 2, 1; xiv. 2, 1, 8; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 4. and a Mṛt-paca, ‘potter,’ in the Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad. 4) ii. 6; iii. 3. A ‘clay vessel,’ Mṛtpātra, 5) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxi. 2. and vessels (pātra) made of clay (mṛn-maya), 6) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 1, 3, 4, etc. are mentioned, and the grave is called the ‘house of clay.’ 7) Rv. vii. 89, 1 (mṛnmaya gṛha). 

mRdh|मृध्
मृध्<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 131, 6; 138, 2; 182, 4; ii. 22, 3; 23, 13; 28, 7; iii. 47, 2; v. 30, 7, etc. and later 2) Av. v. 20, 12; vi. 2, 2; viii. 5, 8; xiii. 1, 5, 27; xviii. 2, 59; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 7, 4; 5, 3, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, v. 37; xi. 10 72, etc. denotes ‘enemy.’

mRdhravaach|मृध्रवाच्
मृध्र-वाच्<BR> See Dasyu and Dāsa.

mexaNa|मेक्षण
मेक्षण<BR> is the name in the Brāhmaṇas 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 10, 4; iii. 7, 4, 9; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 2, 13, etc. of a wooden ladle used for stirring up the oblation (Caru).

mekhalaa|मेखला
मेखला<BR> denotes ‘girdle’ in the later Saṃhitās 1) Av. vi. 133, 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 3, 3, 5; vi. 2, 2, 7; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiii. 4; xxiv. 9; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 6, 7, etc. and the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 1, 10; iv. 4, 5, 2; vi. 2, 2, 39, etc. The Brahmacārin wore a girdle. 3) In the Gṛhya Sūtras the girdle of the Brahmin is of Muñja, that of the Kṣatriya of a bowstring, and that of the Vaiśya of wool or hemp. See Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 19, 12, etc.

megha|मेघ
मेघ<BR> denotes ‘cloud’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 181, 8. and later. 2) Av. iv. 15, 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 2, 5; xii. 3, 2, 6; mahā-megha, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 2, 4; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, vii. 3; viii. 7. The verb meghay, ‘to make cloudy weather,’ is found in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 5, 1, and meghayantī is the name of one of the seven Kṛttikās, Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 4, 1; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 301, 368.

methi|मेथि
मेथि<BR> is found in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 5, 20. denoting ‘post.’ The word is also found in the marriage ritual, 2) Av. xiv. 1, 40. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 9, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxv. 8; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 29, 22; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 3, 21. when the sense is, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, a post to support the pole of a chariot. In one passage of the Rigveda it is perhaps used of posts forming a palisade. 3) viii. 53, 5 (mita-methībhiḥ for medhābhiḥ, conjectured by Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesell schaft, 48, 109). In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 4) xiii. 9, 17. Cf. Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 19, 1 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 23, 329). it appears in the form of Methī to denote the post to which the sacrificial cow is tied. The word is very variously spelt, Medhi and Meṭhī also being found.

medha|मेध
मेध<BR> is a word of uncertain sense occurring in a Vālakhilya hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 50, 10 (cf. viii. 49, 10), where, as a rule, the sense of ‘sacrifice’ is accepted as adequate. According to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, the proper name of a sacrificer may be meant.

medhaatithi|मेधातिथि
मेधातिथि,<BR> 1) This is the form of the later texts and of Rv. viii. 8, 20, where he occurs with Kaṇva. Medhyātithi 2) This is the usual form in the Rv.: i. 36, 10. 11. 17; viii. 1, 30; 2, 40; 33, 4; 49, 9; 51, 1; ix. 43, 3. (‘having a guest at the sacrifice’) appear to be the names of one and the same man, a descendant of Kaṇva and a famous Vedic Ṛṣi, to whom the authorship of various hymns 3) i. 12-23; viii. 1-3; 22. 23; ix. 4143. In the ascriptions Medhātithi and Medhyātithi are confused. is attributed in the Anukramaṇī (Index). To him Indra is said in the Rigveda 4) viii. 2, 40. Cf. i. 51, 1, where, however, there is no mention of Medhāithi. to have come in the form of a ram: this myth is perpetuated in the Subrahmaṇyā formula 5) Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 79; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, i. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 4, 18; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, i. 12, 3. Moreover, the legend is alluded to in the Śāṭyāyanaka. See Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 51, 1; viii. 2, 40, and Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, ccxl. On the explanation of the legend, cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 38 et seq. recited by the priest while the Soma is being carried within the sacrificial enclosure, when Indra is hailed as ‘ram of Medhātithi.’ He appears also as a rival of Vatsa, whom he accused of low birth, but who convinced him of his error by undergoing a fire ordeal (cf. Divya). 6) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 6, 6. In the Atharvaveda 7) iv. 29, 6. he is mentioned with many other sages, and occurs elsewhere 8) As a Gṛhapati at the sacrifice of the Vibhindukīyas, Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 233 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 38); Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xv. 10, 1; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxviii. 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 102, 105; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 146. also as a sage. 

medhya|मेध्य
मेध्य<BR> is the name of a man, an ancient sacrificer, in a hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 52, 2. In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 2) xvi. 11, 26. Cf. Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 39; Ludwig. Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. he is erroneously transmuted into Pṛṣadhra Medhya Mātariśvan, the patron of Praskaṇva Kāṇva.

medhyaatithi|मेध्यातिथि
मेध्यातिथि<BR> See Medhātithi.

menakaa|मेनका
मेनका<BR> See 2. Menā.

menaa|मेना
1. Menā in a few passages of the Rigveda denotes ‘woman.’ 1) Rv. i. 62, 7; 95, 6; ii. 39, 2. The word is also used in the sense of the ‘female’ of an animal, either mare 2) Rv. i. 121, 2. or cow. 3) x. 111, 3. Cf. Pischel, Indische Studien, 2, 316, 317.

menaa|मेना
2. Menā 1) This is the ordinary form of the name. or Menakā 2) So Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, where the masculine form Mena is the epithet of Vṛṣaṇaśva. is mentioned in the Rigveda 3) Rv. i. 51, 13, where Sāyaṇa tells the legend from the Śāṭyāyanaka. Cf. Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, ccxl. and in the Brāhmaṇas 4) Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, i. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 4, 18; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, i. 12, 3; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra. i. 3, 17. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 16, 81, n. as the daughter, or perhaps wife, of Vṛṣaṇaśva. The meaning of the legend connected with her is quite unknown. Cf. Maināka or Mainaga.

meSha|मेष
मेष<BR> denotes ‘ram’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 43, 6; 116, 16; viii. 2, 40; x. 27, 17, etc. and later, 2) Av. vi. 49, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 59; xix. 90; xxiv. 30; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 12, 1; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, i. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 4, 18, etc. while Meṣī means ‘sheep.’ 3) Rv. i. 43, 6; Vājasaneyī Saṃhitā, iii. 59; xxiv. 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 4, 4. etc. Both words are also used to denote the ‘wool’ 4) Meṣa, Rv. viii. 86, 11; Meṣī. ix. 8, 5; 86, 47; 107, 11. of the sheep, especially as employed for the Soma filter. A wild (āraṇya) ram is mentioned in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. 5) xxiv. 30. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 66, 67.

mehatnuu|मेहत्नू
मेहत्नू<BR> is the name of a stream in the Nadīstuti (‘Praise of Rivers’) in the Rigveda. 1) x. 75, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 344. It must apparently have been a tributary of the Sindhu (Indus), entering that river before the Krumu (Kurum) and Gomatī (Gomal). It may conceivably have been a tributary of the Krumu.

maitraayaNiiyabraahmaNa|मैत्रायणीयब्राह्मण
मैत्रायणीय ब्राह्मण<BR> is the name of a text mentioned in the Śulba Sūtra of Baudhāyana. 1) Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxxii. 8. Cf. Caland, U7ber das rituclle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 41, who cannot trace the citation in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.

maitreya|मैत्रेय
मैत्रेय<BR> is the patronymic or metronymic 1) Patronymic from Mitrayu, according to Pāṇini, vi. 4, 174; vii. 3, 2; metronymic from Mitrā, according to the commentator on Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 12, 1. of Kauṣārava in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 2) viii. 28, 18. It is also applied to Glāva in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 3) i. 12, 1; Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 31 et seq.; Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 110.

maitreyii|मैत्रेयी
मैत्रेयी<BR> is the name of one of the wives of Yājṅavalkya according to the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (ii. 4, 1 et seq.; iv. 5, 2 et seq.).

mainaaka|मैनाक
मैनाक,<BR> ‘descendant of Menakā,’ is the name of a mountain among the Himālayas in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka. 1) i. 31, 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 78; Indian Literature, 93. There is a various reading Maināga. 

mainaala|मैनाल
मैनाल<BR> occurs in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 16; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 12, 1. It seems clearly to mean ‘fisherman’ from Mīna, ‘fish,’ as Sāyaṇa 2) On Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. and Mahīdhara 3) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit. explain it.

maujavata|मौजवत
मौजवत<BR> See Mūjavant.

maudgalya|मौद्गल्य
मौद्गल्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Mudgala,’ is the patronymic of several persons, Nāka, 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 5, 2, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 4; Taittirīya Upaniṣad, i. 9, 1. Śatabalākṣa, 2) Nirukta, xi. 6. and Lāṅgalāyana. 3) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 8. A Brahmacārin of the name is mentioned in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa 4) i. 1, 31; Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 110. Cf. also Caland, U7ber das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 35. as disputing with Glāva Maitreya.

mauna|मौन
मौन,<BR> ‘descendant of Muni,’ is the patronymic of Aṇīcin in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (xxiii. 5).

mauShikiiputra|मौषिकीपुत्र
मौषिकी-पुत्र,<BR> ‘son of a female descendant of Mūṣikā,’ is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Hārikarṇīputra in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 4, 30).

mlechCha|म्लेच्छ
म्लेच्छ<BR> occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) iii. 2, 1, 24. in the sense of a barbarian in speech. The Brahmin is there forbidden to use barbarian speech. The example 2) iii. 2, 1, 23. given of such speech is lie 'lavo, explained by Sāyaṇa as he 'rayaḥ, ‘ho, foes.’ If this is correct--the Kāṇva recension has a different reading 3) See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 31, n. 3.<BR> --the barbarians referred to were Āryan speakers, though not speakers of Sanskrit, but of a Prākṛta form of speech. 4) Weber, Indian Literature, 180; cf. Keith, Aitareya Āranyaka, 179, 180, 196. Cf. Vāc. Y.

yaxa|यक्ष
यक्ष<BR> is found several times in the Rigveda 1) i. 190, 4; iv. 3, 13, v. 70, 4; vii. 56, 16; 61, 5; x. 88, 13. and the Atharvaveda 2) viii. 9, 25; x. 2, 32; 7, 38; 8, 43; xi. 2, 24, etc. in passages in which Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 262. sees the meaning of a feast or holy practice in accordance with the native commentators. It is, however, very doubtful whether this sense ever occurs. 4) Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and Geldner's full discussion, Vedische Studien, 3, 126-143.

yaxu|यक्षु
यक्षु<BR> is mentioned, once in the singular and once in the plural, in the hymn of the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 6. 19. which celebrates Sudās battle with the ten kings. Who they were and what part they played in that conflict is quite uncertain. They seem, from the wording of the text, to have taken part in two conflicts, as Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 126, 127. says--one on the Paruṣṇī (Ravi), and one on the Yamunā (Jumna)--with the aid of the Ajas and Śigrus, under the leadership of Bḥeda. It is, however, at least possible that in the former passage Yadu should be read for Yakṣu, or, at any rate, Yakṣu be deemed a contemptuous substitute of the name of a possibly un-Āryan or unimportant tribe (as their allies, the Ajas and Śigrus, clearly were) for the name of the certainly famous Yadus, as is suggested by Hopkins. 3) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 259 et seq. It is not clear however, whether Hopkins thinks that the Yadus are alluded to, but it seems probable. Cf. Turvaśa.

yaxma|यक्ष्म
यक्ष्म<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 122, 9; x. 85, 31; 97, 11. 12; 137, 4; 163, 1-6. and the Atharvaveda 2) ii. 10, 5. 6; iii. 31, 1; v. 4, 9; 30, 6; viii. 7, 2; ix. 8, 3. 7. 10; xii. 2, 1. 2; 4, 8; xix. 36, 1; 38, 1. frequently denotes ‘illness,’ in general, perhaps as rendering the body emaciated. A hundred kinds of Yakṣma are referred to in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 3) xii. 97. and a-yakṣma in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 4) xvii. 11. denotes ‘free from disease.’ In the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 5, 2; 5, 6, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 3, 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 375 et seq.; Grohmann, Indische Studien, 9, 400; Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 60; Jolly, Medicin, 89. an account is given of the origin of Yakṣma, which is distinguished as of three kinds--Rāja-yakṣma, ‘royal Yakṣma,’ Pāpa-yakṣma, ‘evil Yakṣma,’ and Jāyenya, most probably ‘syphilis.’ The second of the series is elsewhere unknown, and can hardly be defined, for it merely means ‘serious or deadly disease.’ Cf. also Ajñātayakṣma.

yajata|यजत
यजत<BR> occurs in a hymn of the Rigveda, 1) v. 44, 10, 11. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138. where he is apparently a Ṛṣi or a sacrificer.

yajurveda|यजुर्वेद
यजुर्-वेद,<BR> the ‘Veda of the sacrificial utterance’ (Yajus), is mentioned frequently in the Brāhmaṇas 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 12, 9, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 32, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 8, 3; xii. 3, 4, 9. and Upaniṣads. 2) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 2, 3, 5; Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, viii. 3, 8; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 5, 5; ii. 4. 10; iv. 1, 2; 5, 11; Chāndogya Upar ṣad, i. 3, 7; iii. 2, 1. 2; 15, 7; vii. 2, 4; 2, 1; 7, 1; Āśvalāyana Sra Sūtra, x. 7, 2; Sāṅkhāyana Sra Sūtra, xvi. 2, 6, etc.

yajus|यजुस्
यजुस्<BR> is repeatedly distinguished from the Ṛc and the Sāman in Vedic literature. 1) Rv. x. 90, 9; Av. v. 26, 1; ix. 6, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 3, 1; 9, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 30; iv. 1; xix. 28; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 29, 21; viii. 13, 2; Śatapatha Brahmaṇa, i. 2, 1, 7; vi. 5, 1, 2; 3, 4, etc. In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 33, there is a reference to the śuklāni Yajūṃṣi, ‘white or pure Yajus,’ as promulgated by Vājasaneya Yājñavalkya, whence the Vājasaneyi Saṃhītā is popularly known as the ‘White Yajurveda.’ The theory that this is due to the fact that in the Vājasaneyi the Mantra parts of the text are not accompanied by Brāhmaṇa passages is, though accepted by Weber, Indian Literature, 103, 104; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xxvii, and others, now to be abandoned. In the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, v. 10, the expression śukrayajāṃṣi seems to refer to books iv. and v. of that text. Cf. also Winternitz. Geschichte der indischen Literatur, 1, 149, n. The Yajus is the utterance accompanying the sacrifice, and may have the form of verse or prose, the tern covering both. 

yaJNagaathaa|यज्ञगाथा
यज्ञ-गाथा<BR> denotes a verse (Gāthā) containing a maxim as to the sacrifice of any kind or sort, 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 43, 5; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ii. 12, 6; Śānkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 8, 26; 9, 6, etc. or, as it is expressed in the Mahābhārata, 2) xii. 791. 2316. a ‘verse sung regarding the sacrifice’ (gāthā yajña-gītā).

yaJNavachasraajastambaayana|यज्ञवचस्राजस्तम्बायन
यज्ञ-वचस् राजस्तम्बायन,<BR> ‘descendant of Rājastamba,’ is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Tura Kāvaṣeya, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) x. 4, 2, 1; 6, 5, 9; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 5, 4 Kāṇva. He is also mentioned in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā. 2) iii. 10, 3; iv. 8, 2.

yaJNasena|यज्ञसेन
यज्ञ-सेन<BR> is the name of a teacher with the patronymic Caitra or Caitriyāyaṇa mentioned in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 3, 8, 1 (Caitriyāyaṇa); Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxi. 4 (Caitra).

yaJNeShu|यज्ञेषु
यज्ञेषु<BR> is the name of a man in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 1) i. 5, 2, 1. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 306. He was made to prosper by his priest Mātsya, who knew the exact moment of sacrificing.

yaJNopaviita|यज्ञोपवीत
यज्ञोपवीत<BR> denotes the ‘wearing of the Brahminical thread over the left shoulder at the sacrifice,’ and is mentioned as early as the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 1) iii. 10, 9, 12. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 11, 1; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 2, 1; 6, 1, 12; and Prācīnāvīta. Tilak, 2) Orion, 145 et seq., quoting Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 1, and, the view of the Mīmāmsists, Jaiminīyanyāyamālāvistara, iii. 4, 1. This view is not prejudiced by the quite implausible conjectures as to Orion's belt with which it is combined. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books o the East, 12, 361, 424. however, urges that it was not originally a thread that was worn, but a garment of cloth (Vāsas) or of deerskin (Ajina). This seems quite probable. 

yati|यति
यति<BR> is the name of an ancient clan which is connected with the Bhṛgus in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 3, 9; 6, 18; Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 465, n. where the Yatis certainly seem to be real persons. In another hymn, 2) x. 72, 7. however, they already appear as almost mythical. In the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 9, 2; vi. 2, 7, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, viii. 5; xi. 10; xxv. 6; xxxvi. 7; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, viii. 1, 4; xiii. 4, 16; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 28, 1; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, i. 3, etc.; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 437 et seq. and elsewhere, 4) ii. 304. In the parallel passage, Av. ii. 5, 3, the reading Yatīr is found, possibly an error for Yatīn, or merely a blunder. Cf. Muir, op. cit., 5, 49, n. 92; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 44; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, vi. 3, 1. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 146. the Yatis are a race whom Indra, in an evil moment, gave over to the hyænas (Sālāvṛka): exactly what is referred to is uncertain. Yati is mentioned with Bhṛgu in a verse of the Sāmaveda. 4) ii. 304. In the parallel passage, Av. ii. 5, 3, the reading Yatīr is found, possibly an error for Yatīn, or merely a blunder. Cf. Muir, op. cit., 5, 49, n. 92; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 44; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, vi. 3, 1. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 146.

yadu|यदु
यदु<BR> is the name of a tribe and of the king of the tribe. They are mentioned repeatedly in the Rigveda, 1) i. 36, 18; 54, 6; 174, 9; iv. 30, 17; v. 31, 8; vi. 45, 1; viii. 4, 7; 7, 18; 9, 14; 10, 5; 45, 27; ix. 61, 2; x. 49, 8; plural, i. 108, 8. See Turvaśa, and Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 258 et seq. normally in conjunction with Turvaśa. They seem to have taken part in the great battle against Sudās: 2) Whether Yadu should be read in Rv. vii. 18, 6, or not, the Yadus seem to be meant. Cf. Yakṣu. the Yadu and the Turvaśa kings seem to have escaped with their lives, while the Anu and the Druhyu kings perished. This is at least the most natural explanation of several passages, 3) Rv. i. 174, 9; iv. 30, 17; v. 31, 3; vi. 20, 12. though these passages possibly refer to a successful raid across the Sarayu, and a defeat of two princes, Arṇa and Citraratha. 4) Rv. iv. 30, 18. That Turvaśa was the Yadu king, as Hopkins 5) Loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 122, 124; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 205; 5, 142; Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 37. holds, is most improbable.

yantR|यन्तृ
यन्तृ<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 162, 19; x. 22, 5. and in the Sūtras 2) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 6, 29, etc. denotes a ‘driver’ of horses or ‘charioteer.’ 

yama|यम
यम<BR> denotes ‘twins,’ the birth of which is frequently alluded to in Vedic literature. 1) Rv. i. 66, 4; 164, 15; ii. 39, 2; iii. 39, 3; v. 57, 4; vi. 59, 2; x. 13, 2; 117, 9; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 4, 10, etc. Twins of different sex seem to be indicated by the expression yamau mithunau. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiii. 4; Nirukta, xii. 10. There are traces of the belief--widely spread among negro and other races--that twins are uncanny and of evil omen, 3) Av. iii. 28; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 9, 8; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxv. 4, 35; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iii. 4, 14, etc. Cf. Yamasū; Yuktāśva. but there are also vestiges of the opposite opinion, that twins are lucky. 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 1, 3; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxiv. 12, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 1, 8, and cf. Rv. iii. 39, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 298300; Naxatra, 2, 314, n.

yamanaxatra|यमनक्षत्र
यम-नक्षत्र<BR> See Nakṣatra.

yamasuu|यमसू
यम-सू,<BR> a ‘bearer of twins,’ is one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 15; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 11, 1.

yamunaa|यमुना
यमुना,<BR> ‘twin,’ the name of a river, so called as running parallel with the Ganges, is mentioned thrice in the Rigveda, 1) v. 52, 17; vii. 18, 19; x. 75, 5. and not rarely later. According to the Rigveda, 2) vii. 18, 19. See Bharata and Kuru. the Tṛtsus and Sudās won a great victory against their foes on the Yamunā; there is no reason 3) The Tṛtsus’ territory lay between the Yamunā and the Sarasvatī on the east and the west respectively. whatever to accept Hopkins' 4) India, Old and New, 52. view that the Yamunā here was another name of the Paruṣṇī (Ravi). In the Atharvaveda 5) iv. 9, 10. the salve (Āñjana) of the Yamunā (Yāmuna) is mentioned along with that of Trikakud (Traikakuda) as of value. In the Aitareya 6) viii. 23. and the Śatapatha 7) xiii. 5, 4, 11. Brāhmaṇas the Bharatas are famed as victorious on the Yamunā. Other Brāhmaṇas 8) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ix. 4, 11 (cf. Pārāvata); xxv. 10, 24; 13, 4; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 29, 25. 33; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxiv. 6, 10. 39; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 19, 9, 10; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 6, 28, etc. also mention this river. In the Mantrapāṭha 9) ii. 11, 12. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 5; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 323. the Sālvas are spoken of as dwelling on its banks.

yayaati|ययाति
ययाति<BR> is mentioned twice in the Rigveda, 1) i. 31, 17; x. 63, 1. once as an ancient sacrificer, and once as Nahuṣya, ‘descendant of Nahuṣa,’ apparently a king. There is no trace whatever of his connexion with Pūru, as in the Epic, 2) Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 147; Muir, Sanskrit Texts 12, 232. the tradition of which must be deemed to be inaccurate.

yava|यव
1. Yava in the Rigveda 1) i. 23, 15; 66, 3; 117, 21; 135, 8; 176, 2; ii. 5, 6; 14, 11; v. 85, 3; vii. 3, 4; viii. 2, 3; 22, 6; 63. 9; 78, 10, etc. appears to be a generic term for any sort of ‘grain,’ and not merely ‘barley.’ The latter sense is probably found in the Atharvaveda, 2) ii. 8, 3; vi. 30, 1; 50. 1. 2; 91, 1; 141, 2; 142, 1. 2; viii. 7, 20; ix. 1, 22; 6, 14; xii. 1, 42; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 10, 3; 4, 10, 5; vii. 2, 10, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxv. 10; xxvi. 5; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, v. 26; xviii. 12; xxiii. 30; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 4, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 4, 20: ii. 5, 2, 1; iii. 6, 1, 9. 10; iv. 2, 1, 11; xii. 7, 2, 9; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iii. 14, 3, etc.; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, iv. 12. and is regular later. The barley harvest came after spring, 3) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, iv. 13. in the summer. 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 2, 10, 2. That barley was cultivated in the period of the Rigveda 5) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 86, n. is not certain, but on the whole very probable. 6) Sowing (vap) grain is referred to in Rv. i. 117, 21; ripening of grain in 135, 8; ploughing (kṛṣ) in i. 176, 2. Grain rejoicing in rain is alluded to in ii. 5, 6. See Kṛṣi. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 282; Kuhn, Indische Studien, 1, 355, 356; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238, 239.

yava|यव
2. Yava. See Māsa.

yavasa|यवस
यवस<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 38, 5; 91, 13; iii. 45, 3; iv. 41, 10; 42, 5; vii. 18, 10; 87, 2; 93, 2; 102, 1, etc. and later 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 43, etc. denotes the ‘grass’ on which animals feed, and which is burned by the forest fire. 3) Cf. Agni, yavasād, in Rv. i. 94, 11. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 47; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 87. 

yavaaguu|यवागू
यवागू<BR> means ‘barley-gruel,’ 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 5, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 2; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 8, 8; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, iv. 13, etc. but is also used of weak decoctions of other kinds of grain. 2) Of Jartila and Gvīdhuka, Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 4, 3, 2.

yavaashir|यवाशिर्
यवाशिर्<BR> is used in the Rigveda 1) i. 187, 9; ii. 22, 1; iii. 42, 7; viii. 94, 4. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 227; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 279. as an epithet of Soma, meaning ‘mixed with grain.’

yavaaSha|यवाष
यवाष<BR> See Yevāṣa.

yavya|यव्य
यव्य<BR> in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (i. 7, 2, 46) denotes ‘month’ (lit., ‘containing a first half,’ see 2. Yava).

yavyaavatii|यव्यावती
यव्यावती<BR> is the name of a river in the Rigveda 1) vi. 27, 6. and in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 2) xxv. 7, 2. Hillebrandt 3) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 268, n. 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 18, 19; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 204; Kaegi, Rigveda, n. 338; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 168, n. 1. thinks that the river is one in Iran, the Djob (Zhobe), near the Iryāb (Haliāb), but there is no reason to accept this identification.

yashasvinjayantalauhitya|यशस्विन्जयन्तलौहित्य
यशस्विन् जयन्त लौहित्य<BR> (‘descendant of Lohita’) is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Kṛṣṇarāta Triveda Lauhitya in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 42, 1).

yaShTi|यष्टि
यष्टि,<BR> ‘staff,’ is mentioned in the latest parts of the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 2, 17 of veṇu, ‘bamboo’); Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 7; Kauṣitāki Upaniṣap iv. 19. etc. 

yaska|यस्क
यस्क<BR> is the name of a man. The Yaskas, descendants of Girikṣit (Gairikṣitāḥ) are mentioned in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 1) xiii. 12. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 475 et seq.; 8, 245 et seq.; Indian Literature, 41, n. 30. Cf. Yāska.

yaaJNatura|याज्ञतुर
याज्ञ-तुर,<BR> ‘descendant of Yajñatura,’ is the patronymic of 2. Ṛṣabha in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) xii. 8, 3, 7; xiii. 5, 4, 15; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 9, 8, 10.

yaaJNavalkya|याज्ञवल्क्य
याज्ञ-वल्क्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Yajñavalkya,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) i. 1, 1, 9; 3, 1, 21. 26; 9, 3, 16; ii. 3, 1, 21; 4, 3, 2; 5, 1, 2 (where he is said to be in contradiction with the Rigveda); iii. 1, 1, 4; 2, 21; 3, 10; 8, 2, 24 (cursed by a Caraka teacher); iv. 2, 1, 7; 6, 1, 10; 8, 7, etc. There are no references to Yājñavalkya in books v-ix, which, on the contrary, owe their doctrine to Tura Kāvaṣeya and Śāṇḍilya; but the fame of Yājñavalkya revives in books x-xiv--e.g., xi. 3, 1, 2; 4, 2, 17; 3, 20; 6, 2, 1; 3, 1; xii. 4, 1, 10, etc. as an authority on questions of ritual. He is, however, also given as an authority on questions of philosophy in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 2) iii. 1, 2 et seq.; 2, 10 et seq.; 3, 1; 4, 1; 5, 1; 6, 1; 7, 1, etc. but Oldenberg 3) Buddha,^5 34, n. 1. is, no doubt, right in thinking that no possible importance can be attached to the mention of Yājñavalkya in the latter capacity. He is said to have been a pupil of Uddālaka Āruṇi, 4) vi. 4, 33 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 5, 4 Kāṇva). whom he opposed successfully in a dispute. 5) iii. 7, 1. His two wives, Maitreyī and Kātyāyanī, are mentioned in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 6) ii. 4, 1; iv. 5, 1 et seq. which concludes 7) vi. 4, 33 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 5, 4 Kāṇva). with a passage ascribing to Yājñavalkya Vājasaneya the ‘white Yajus’ (śuklāni yajūṃṣi). It is remarkable that Yājñavalkya is never mentioned in any other Vedic text outside the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa except the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 8) ix. 7; xiii. 1. where, however, both reference are merely transcripts from the Śatapatha. 9) Weber, Indian Literature, 132, n. *; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 374. It has been supposed by Oldenberg 10) Buddha,^5 34, n. 1. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 120 et seq.; Indische Studien, 1, 173; 13, 265269; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xxx et seq.; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 188. and others that Yājñavalkya belonged to Videha, but despite the legend of Janaka's patronage of him, his association with Uddālaka, the Kuru-Pañcāla, renders this doubtful.

yaajyaa|याज्या
याज्या<BR> (scil. ṛc, ‘verse’) denotes the words uttered at the moment of offering the sacrifice, ‘consecrating sacrificial formula,’ in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 5, 2, 1; 6, 10, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 20; xx. 12, etc. and the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 8; 11, 10; ii. 13, 2; 26, 3. 5. 6; 40, 8; iii. 32, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 2, 19; iii. 4, 4, 2; vii. 2, 7, 11, etc.

yaatudhaana|यातुधान

The feminine, Yātudhānī, is also found in the Rigveda and later. 4) Rv. i. 191, 8; x. 118, 8; Av. i. 28, 24; ii. 14, 3; iv. 9, 9; 18, 17; xix. 37, 8, etc. Cf. Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 26, 65 et seq.

yaatuvid|यातुविद्
यातु-विद्,<BR> denoting in the plural ‘those who know sorcery,’ designates the Atharvaveda in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) x. 5, 2, 20. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xxii.; Atharvaveda, 1. 8, 9, 23.

yaadva|याद्व
याद्व,<BR> ‘descendant of Yadu,’ is used of the Yadu prince in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) vii. 19, 8. while the largesse of the Yādvas 2) Rv. viii. 6, 46. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 142. is alluded to elsewhere. In another passage a beast (paśu) of the Yadus or Yādvas is mentioned. 3) Rv. viii. 1, 31. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 3; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 37. Cf. Yadu. 

yaana|यान
यान<BR> denotes ‘vehicle’ in the Rigveda 1) iv. 43, 6. and later. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 3, 7; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vi. 3, 10; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 12, 3, etc.

yaama|याम
याम,<BR> used in the plural, denotes in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 21, 2. according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1d. the planets among which the sun (bhaga) wanders. But both Bloomfield 3) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 30. and Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 396. accept the sense--the regular one in the later language--of ‘night watches.’

yaaman|यामन्
यामन्<BR> denotes in the Rigveda 1) iv. 24. 2; vii. 66, 5; 85, 1; ix. 64, 10; x. 78, 6; 80, 5. a ‘march’ or ‘expedition’ in war.

yaayaavara|यायावर
यायावर<BR> 1) Literally, ‘wandering about,’ from the intensive of yā, ‘to go.’ denotes a person of no fixed abode in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 1, 7; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xix. 12.

yaava|याव
याव<BR> See Māsa.

yaaska|यास्क
यास्क<BR> (‘descendant of Yaska’) is mentioned in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1) ii. 5, 21; iv. 5, 27 (Mādhyaṃdina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Kāṇva). Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 128. as a contemporary of Āsurāyaṇa and a teacher of Bhāradvāja. Whether Yāska, author of the Nirukta, 2) Ṛgveda Prātiśākhya, xvii. 25; Weber, op. cit., 25, 26, etc.; Indische Studien, 1, 17, 103; 3, 396; 8, 243, etc.; Indian Literature, 41, n. 30. was the same person, it is, of course, impossible to say.

yu|यु
यु,<BR> appearing in the dual in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (iii. 7, 4, 10), seems to mean ‘yoke animals.’ 

yukta|युक्त
युक्त<BR> in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (vi. 7, 4, 8; xii. 4, 1, 2) denotes a ‘yoke’ of oxen. Cf. 1. Yuga.

yuktaashva|युक्ताश्व
युक्ताश्व<BR> is the name of a man who is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) xi. 8, 8. as the seer of a Sāman, or chant. He is said to have exposed a pair of twins, 2) Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 314, n., whose view is that of Sāyaṇa on the passage. Cf. Yama. but Hopkins 3) Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 61, 62. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie. 2, 160. thinks that the reference is only to an exchange of children.

yuga|युग
1. Yuga in the Rigveda 1) i. 115, 2; 184, 3; ii. 39, 4; iii. 53, 17; viii. 80, 7; x. 60, 8; 101, 3, etc. and later 2) Av. iv. 1, 40; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 1, 24. 34; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 1, 3, etc. denotes ‘yoke.’ Cf. Ratha.

yuga|युग
2. Yuga in the Rigveda 1) Yuge-yuge, ‘in every age,’ i. 139, 8; iii. 26, 3; vi. 8, 5; 15, 8; 36, 5; ix. 94, 12; uttarā yugāni, ‘future ages,’ iii. 33, 8; x. 10, 10; pūrvāṇi yugāni, vii. 70, 4; uttare yuge, x. 72, 1, etc. In i. 92, 11; 103, 4; 115, 2; 124, 2; 144, 4, etc., the phrase ‘generations of men’ (manṣyā, manuṣaḥ, janānām) are referred to. See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 45, 46. frequently denotes a ‘generation’; but the expression daśame yuge applied to Dīrghatamas in one passage 2) i. 158, 6. Wilson, Translation, 2, 104, n., suggests that yuga here means a lustrum of five years; but the tenth decade is far more likely, as Dīrghatamas is said to be ‘aged’ (jujurvān). must mean ‘tenth decade’ of life. There is no reference in the older Vedic texts to the five-year cycle (see Saṃvatsara). The quotation from the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 3) xvii. 13, 17. given in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, and by Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 368. and others, is merely a citation from a modern text in the commentary on that work. Nor do the older Vedic texts know of any series of Yugas or ages such as are usual later. In the Atharvaveda 5) viii. 2, 21. there are mentioned in order a hundred years, an ayuta (10,000?), and then two, three, or four Yugas: the inference from this seems to be that a Yuga means more than an ayuta, but is not very certain. Zimmer 6) Op. cit., 371. adduces a passage from the Rigveda, 7) viii. 101, 4 = Av. x. 8, 3. but the reference there, whatever it may be, 8) Cf. Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 1, 1, with Keith's note; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 253. is certainly not to the four ages (cf. also Triyuga). 9) In Rv. x. 72, 2, devānāṃ pūrvye yuge, ‘in the earlier age of the gods,’ occurs. The Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 10) iii. 12, 9, 2. Cf. Muir, 12, 42, n. 66. recognizes long periods of time--e.g., one of 100,000 years. To the four ages, Kali, Dvāpara, Tretā, and Kṛta, there is no certain reference in Vedic literature, though the names occur as the designations of throws at dice (see Akṣa). In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 11) vii. 15, 4 (in the description of the merits of exertion): ‘A man while lying is the Kali; moving himself, he is the Dvāpara; rising, he is the Tretā; walking, he becomes the Kṛta’ (Kaliḥ śayāno bhavati saṃjihānas tu Dvāparaḥ | uttiṣṭhaṃs Tretā bhavati, Kṛtaṃ saṃpadyate caran||). the names occur, but it is not clear that the ages are really meant. Haug 12) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 2, 464, criticized by Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 319. thought that the dice were meant: this view is at least as probable as the alternative explanation, which is accepted by Weber, 13) Indische Studien, 1, 286; 9, 315 et seq. Roth, 14) Indische Studien, 1, 460. Wilson, 15) Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1851, 99. Max Müller, 16) Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 412. and Muir. 17) Sanskrit Texts, 12, 48, n. 86. Roth, indeed, believes that the verse is an interpolation; but in any case it must be remembered that the passage is from a late book of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. Four ages--Puṣya, Dvāpara, Khārvā, and Kṛta--are mentioned in the late Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 18) v. 6. and the Dvāpara in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa. 19) i. 1, 28; Weber, Indian Literature, 151, n. 166; Windisch, Buddha und Māra, 151. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 367371; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 91. A quite different theory of the Yugas is given by Shamasastry, Gavām Ayana, 141 et seq., but his whole theory is quite impossible. Weber once (Indian Literature, 113, n. 127) found the mention of the quinquennial Yuga in Rv. iii. 55, 18, but that passage refers to the five or six seasons (see Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 382, n.), while i. 25, 8, merely alludes to the intercalary month. Weber also (op. cit., 70, 247) considers that the Yugas are derived from the phases of the moon, but this idea was long since disposed of by Roth, Die Lehre von den vier Weltaltern (Tübingen, 1860). 

yuddha|युद्ध
युद्ध<BR> in the Rigveda 1) x. 54, 2. and later 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 9, 1; Aitareva Brāhmaṇa, iii. 39, 1. 2; vi. 36, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 1, 5, 6; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iii. 1, etc. denotes ‘battle.’ The more usual word earlier 3) Rv. i. 53, 7; 59, 1; v. 25, 6; vi. 46, 11, etc.; Av. i. 24, 1; iv. 24, 7; vi. 66, 1; 103, 3, etc.; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 4, 16, etc. is Yudh.

yudhaaMshrauShTiaugrasainya|युधांश्रौष्टिऔग्रसैन्य
युधां-श्रौष्टि औग्र-सैन्य<BR> (‘descendant of Ugrasena’) is the name, in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 1) viii. 21, 7. Cf. Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 8. The Paurāṇic form is Yuddha-muṣṭi. of a king who was anointed by Parvata and Nārada.

yudhyaamadhi|युध्यामधि
युध्यामधि<BR> is apparently the name of a king who was defeated by Sudās. The mention of him occurring only in the verses added at the end of the hymn celebrating the victory of Sudās over the ten kings 1) Rv. vii. 18, 24. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173. can claim little authenticity as a notice of Sudās.

yuvati|युवति
युवति<BR> is the ordinary expression for a ‘young woman’ or ‘maiden’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 118, 5; ii. 35, 4; iii. 54, 14; iv. 18, 8; v. 2, 1. 2; ix. 86, 16; x. 30, 5. and later. 2) Av. xiv. 2, 61; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 1, 9; 2, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 1, 9, 6; 4, 3, 8, etc.

यूथ<BR> is the word for ‘herd’ of cows in the Rigveda 1) i. 10, 2; 81, 7; iii. 55, 17; iv. 2, 18; 38, 5; v. 41, 19; ix. 71, 9, etc. Cf. yūthya, ‘of the herd,’ viii. 56, 4; ix. 15, 4; x. 23, 4. and later. 2) Av. v. 20, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 7, 2, 1, etc.

yuupa|यूप
यूप<BR> in the Rigveda 1) v. 2, 7 (of Sunaḥśepa). and later 2) Av. ix. 6, 22; xii. 1, 38; xiii. 1, 47; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 3, 4, 1; vii. 2, 1, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 17; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa; ix. 10, 2, etc. means a ‘post,’ usually that to which the sacrificial victim was tied. It also designates the post to which the door of the house was attached (Durya). 3) Rv. i. 51, 14. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 153. 

yuuShan|यूषन्
यूषन्,<BR> occurring in the description of the horse-sacrifice in the Rigveda 1) i. 162, 13. and the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 3, 11, 1. 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxv. 9. denotes the ‘broth’ which was made from the flesh of the sacrificial animal, and was no doubt used as food. Vessels employed for holding it, Pātra and Āsecana, are mentioned. Another form of the word, found in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 3) vi. 3, 11, 1. 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 271; Schrader, Prehisteric Antiquities, 316. is Yūs, which corresponds to the Latin jus.

yevaaSha|येवाष
येवाष<BR> is the name of a destructive insect in the Atharvaveda. 1) v. 23, 7. 8. The form Yavāṣa is found in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 2) xxx. 1 (Indische Studien, 3, 462). The same form occurs in the Gaṇas, kumudādi and prekṣādi (Pāṇini, iv. 2, 80). Cf. Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 8, 1, where Yavāṣa should be read; Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā, xlvi. 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Vṛṣa.

yoktra|योक्त्र
योक्त्र<BR> in the Rigveda 1) iii. 33, 13 v. 33, 2. and later 2) Av. iii. 30 6; vii. 78, 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 4, 3, Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 3, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 1, 13; vi. 4, 3, 7, etc. denotes the ‘thongs’ used for yoking the chariot or cart.

yoga|योग
योग<BR> denotes the yoke of oxen or horses drawing a car in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 91, 1 (yokes of six or eight); Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 2, etc. Cf. Sīra. and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 2) iv. 3, 11 (ratha-yogāḥ, ‘chariot teams’).

yojana|योजन
योजन<BR> occurs frequently in the Rigveda 1) i. 123, 8; ii. 16, 3; x. 78, 7; 86, 20, etc. and later 2) Av. iv. 26, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 9; iii. 8, 4; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 2, 7, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 363, who finds in Rv. i. 123, 8, yojana as a division of time equivalent to the Muhūrta. But this is most improbable. as a measure of distance, 3) That is, the distance driven in one ‘harnessing’ (without unyoking), a ‘stage.’ but there is no reference defining its real length. Later it is reckoned at four Krośas, or about nine miles. 4) Sometimes calculated at 8 krośas, or 18 miles. The estimate of 2(1/2) miles is also found.

yodha|योध
योध<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 143, 5; iii. 39, 4; vi. 25, 5; x. 78, 3. means ‘fighter,’ ‘warrior,’ ‘soldier.’

yoShan|योषन्
योषन्, योषणा, योषा, योषित्<BR> all denote ‘young woman,’ ‘maiden,’ as an object of affection, and as meet for wedlock. 1) Yoṣan, Rv. iv. 5, 5; Yoṣaṇā, iii. 52, 3; 56, 5; 62, 8; vii. 95, 3. etc.; Yoṣā, i. 48, 5; 92, 11; iii. 33, 10; 38, 8, etc.; Av. xii. 3, 29; xiv. 1, 56, etc.; Yoṣit, Rv. ix. 28, 4; Av. vi. 101, 1, etc. Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 418. So these terms are often opposed in the Brāhmaṇas to Vṛṣan, ‘male,’ in the general sense of ‘female,’ 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 5, 15 (yoṣā), and often in the Brāhmaṇas. but they also occur in the sense of ‘wife,’ 3) Av. xii. 3, 29 (yoṣā). or ‘daughter,’ 4) So yoṣā in Rv. i. 117, 20. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 310. or merely ‘girl.’ 5) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 1, 7. See Strī.

raghaT|रघट्
रघट्<BR> occurs once in the plural in the Atharvaveda, 1) viii. 7, 24. where the Paippalāda recension reads vaghaṭah. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 1a. once con jectured raghavaḥ, ‘swift,’ as the correct reading. Bloomfield, 3) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 580. who in his translation explains the word as ‘falcons,’ in his notes inclines to think Roth's conjecture likely. Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 504. suggests ‘bees’ as the meaning. Possibly some kind of bird may be intended. 5) Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 501.

Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 180; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 56; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 151, 152; Vincent Smith, Indian Antiquary, 34, 230.

rajanii|रजनी
रजनी<BR> is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) i. 23, 1. Cf. Roth in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 24; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 267. where it denotes some sort of plant, probably so called because of its power of ‘colouring’ (from rañj, ‘to colour’). The species cannot be identified owing to the untrustworthiness of the later authorities who attempt its identification.

rajayitrii|रजयित्री
रजयित्री,<BR> a ‘female dyer,’ is included in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 12; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 7, 1.

Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 10; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. In some passages 6) Rv. i. 166, 3; iii. 62, 16; x. 75. 7. the word refers in the plural to the dusty fields on earth.

rajas|रजस्
2. Rajas in one passage of the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Rajaḥ-śaya, Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, v. 8; rajāśaya, Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 2, 11, 2 (Sāyaṇa on Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 23, 2); Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 2, 7; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, ii. 8. clearly means ‘silver,’ like Rajata. It is also taken in this sense in one passage of the Rigveda 2) x. 105, 7. by Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 55, 56. but this interpretation is doubtful.

rajasa|रजस
रजस<BR> occurs once in the Atharvaveda, 1) x. 2, 25. apparently as the name of a kind of ‘fish.’ Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 621; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveḍa, 624. however, understood it as an adjective meaning ‘impure.’ 

raji|रजि
रजि<BR> occurs in the Rigveda 1) vi. 26, 6. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 156; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., where Roth compares a conjecture in Av. xx. 128, 13 seemingly as the name of a king, or perhaps demon, slain by Indra for Piṭhīnas.

रत्निन्,<BR> ‘receiving gifts,’ is the term applied to those people of the royal entourage in whose houses the Ratna-havis, a special rite, was performed in the course of the Rājasūya or ‘royal consecration.’ The list given in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) i. 8, 9, 1 et seq. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 2) i. 7, 3, 1 et seq. consists of the Brahman (i.e., the Purohita), the Rājanya, the Mahiṣī (the first wife of the king), the Vāvāta (the favourite wife of the king), the Parivṛktī (the discarded wife), the Senānī, ‘commander of the army’; the Sūta, ‘charioteer’; the Grāmaṇī, ‘village headman’; the Kṣattṛ, ‘chamberlain’; the Saṃgrahītṛ, ‘charioteer’ or ‘treasurer’; the Bhāgadugha, ‘collector of taxes’ or ‘divider of food’; and the Akṣāvāpa, ‘superintender of dicing’ or ‘thrower of dice.’ In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3) v. 3, 1, 1 et seq. the order is Senānī; Purohita; Mahisī; Sūta; Grāmaṇī; Kṣattṛ; Saṃgrahitṛ; Bhāgadugha; Akṣāvāpa; Go-nikartana, ‘slayer of cows’ or ‘huntsman’; and Pālāgala, ‘courier’; the ‘discarded wife’ being mentioned as forbidden to stay at home 4) According to Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 3, 35, she goes to a Brahmin's house, where she shares his inviolability and exemption from jurisdiction. on the day of the ceremony of offering a pap for Nirṛti in her house. In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 5) ii. 6, 5; iv. 3, 8. the list is Brahman (i.e., Purohita); Rājan; Mahiṣī; Parivṛktī; Senānī; Saṃgrahītṛ; Kṣattṛ; Sūta; Vaiśyagrāmaṇī; Bhāgadugha; Takṣa-Rathakārau, ‘carpenter and chariot-maker’; Akṣāvāpa; and Go-vikarta. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 6) xv. 4. substitutes Go-vyacha for Govikarta, and omits Takṣa-Rathakārau. It will be seen that the list is essentially that of the royal household, and of the king's servants in the administration of the country, though the exact sense of Saṃgrahītṛ, Bhāgadugha, Sūta, Grāmaṇī, Kṣattṛ, is open to reasonable doubt, mainly as to whether public officers or private servants 7) Similarly Akṣāvāpa is either the man who dices for the king--i.e., a professional dicer who plays with the king or watches his play--or a public officer who superintends the gambling halls of the state and collects the revenue, as was regularly done later on. Early English history shows similar evolution of household officers into ministers of state. are meant, for the names are of uncertain significance. A briefer list of eight Vīras, ‘heroes,’ as among the friends of the king, is given in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa: 8) xix. 1, 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 200; U7ber den Rājasūya, 4; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 128; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 58-65; Hopkins, Trañsactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 30, n. 2. brother, son, Purohita, Mahiṣī, Sūta, Grāmaṇī, Kṣattṛ, and Saṃgrahītṛ.

ratha|रथ
रथ<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 20, 3; iii. 15, 5; iv. 4, 10; 16, 20; 36, 2; 43, 25, etc. and later 2) Av. v. 14, 5; x. 1, 8: Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 12, 3, etc. denotes ‘chariot’ as opposed to Anas, ‘cart,’ though the distinction is not absolute. Of differences in the structure of the two we have no information, except that the Kha, or nave hole, in the wheel of the chariot was greater than in that of the cart. 3) viii. 91, 7, with Sāyaṇa's note; Vedische Studien, 2, 333. The chariot has, as a rule, two wheels (Cakra), to which reference is frequently made. 4) Cf. Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 16, 5; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 16, 7; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, i. 4. The wheel consisted of a rim (Pavi), a felly (Pradhi), spokes (Ara), 5) Cf. Rv. i. 32, 15; 141, 9; v. 13, 6; 58, 5; viii. 20, 14; 77, 3; x. 78, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 4, etc. and a nave (Nabhya). The rim and the felly together constitute the Nemi. The hole in the nave is called Kha: into it the end of the axle was inserted; but there is some uncertainty whether Āṇi denotes the extremity of the axle that was inserted in the nave, or the lynch-pin used to keep that extremity in the wheel. Sometimes a solid wheel was used. 6) Cf. Pradhī. The axle (Akṣa) was, in some cases, made of Araṭu wood; 7) Rv. viii. 46, 27; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 247, n. round its ends the wheels revolved. To the axle was attached the body of the chariot (Kośa). This part is also denoted by the word Vandhura, which more precisely means the ‘seat’ of the chariot. The epithet tri-vandhura is used of the chariot of the Aśvins, seemingly to correspond with another of its epithets, tri-cakra: perhaps, as Weber 8) Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1898, 564; Virchow, Zeitschrift für Ethnologie 5, 200. Cf. note 21. thinks, a chariot with three seats and three wheels was a real form of vehicle; but Zimmer 9) Op. cit. iii. considers that the vehicle was purely mythical. Garta also denotes the seat of the warrior. At right angles to the axle was the pole of the chariot (Īṣā, Praüga). Normally there was, it seems, one pole, on either side of which the horses were harnessed, a yoke (Yuga) being laid across their necks; the pole was passed through the hole in the yoke (called Kha 10) This seems to be the sense of Rv. viii. 91, 7; but it has also been taken as the opening in the yoke through which the ox's head passed (the Homeric ). See Cowell's note on Wilson's translation; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 237, n. or Tardman), 11) Av. xiv. 1, 40. the yoke and the pole then being tied together. 12) Rv. iii. 6, 6; v. 56, 4; x. 60, 8. The horses were tied by the neck (grīvā), where the yoke was placed, and also at the shoulder, presumably by traces fastened to a bar of wood at right angles to the pole, or fastened to the ends of the pole, if that is to be regarded, as it probably should, as of triangular shape, wide at the foot and coming to a point at the tip. 13) Zimmer, op. cit., 249, thinks that vāṇī in Rv. i. 119, 5, denotes the two bars of wood to which the traces were fastened. This is also the view of Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., Böhtlingk's Lexicon, and Grassmann. The word may mean ‘two voices’ (Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 162). The traces seem to be denoted by Raśmi and Raśanā. These words also denote the ‘reins,’ which were fastened to the bit (perhaps śiprā) in the horse's mouth. The driver controlled the horses by reins, and urged them on with a whip (Kaśā). 14) Rv. v. 83, 3; vi. 75, 6. The girths of the horse were called Kakṣyā. 15) Rv. x. 10, 13; kakṣya-prā, ‘filling out the girths’ (i.e., ‘well fed’), is an epithet of Indra's horses, i. 10, 3. The normal number of horses seems to have been two, but three or four 16) Three horses are mentioned in Rv. x. 33, 5, and Praṣṭi in Rv. i. 39, 6; viii. 7, 28, etc., may have the sense of ‘third horse.’ See also Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 4, 11; 2, 4, 9, etc.; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 13, 12. For four horses, cf. Rv. ii. 18, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 3, 17; 1, 4, 11; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 21, n. 1. were often used. It is uncertain whether, in these cases, the extra horse was attached in front or at the side; possibly both modes were in use. Even five steeds could be employed. 17) Rathaḥ pañcavāhī, Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 3. In the parallel passage the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 7, 2, has praṣṭivāhī. Horses were normally used for chariots, but the ass (gardabha) 18) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 9, 4. or mule (aśvatarī) 19) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 2, 1; v. 13, 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 9, 1. are also mentioned. The ox was employed for drawing carts, and in fact derived its name, Anaḍvāh, from this use. Sometimes a poor man had to be content with a single steed, which then ran between two shafts. 20) Rv. x. 101, 11; 131, 3, and vi. 15, 19; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 13, 12; xxi. 13, 8, etc. In the chariot the driver stood on the right, while the warrior was on the left, as indicated by his name, Savyeṣṭha or Savyaṣṭhā, 21) This is the case in Av. viii. 8, 23, with Savyaṣṭhā, and in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 7, 9, 1, savyeṣṭha-sārathi occurs as a compound where the sense is certainly ‘the warrior and the charioteer.’ See also Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 1, 8, and Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 62, n. 1. The Greek notices speak of two warriors and a charioteer. Cf. the Aśvins' car with its three seats. See von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 435. He could also sit when he wanted, for the chariot had seats, and an archer would naturally prefer to sit while shooting his arrows. The dimensions of the chariot are given in the Śulba Sūtra 22) vi. 5 (Bürk, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 56, 344, 345). of Āpastamba at 188 Aṅgulis (finger-breadths) for the pole, 104 for the axle, and 86 for the yoke. The material used in its construction was wood, except for the rim of the wheel. 23) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 3, 16. The chariot used at the bridal procession was made of Śalmali wood, Rv. x. 85, 20. For the chariot in the Epic, see Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 235-262; and cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 338, 339; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 245-252; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 38, n. 1. Many other parts of the chariot are mentioned, their names being often obscure in meaning: see Aṅka, Nyaṅka, Uddhi, Pakṣas, Pātalya, Bhurij, Rathopastha, Rathavāhana.

rathakaara|रथकार
रथ-कार,<BR> ‘chariot-maker,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 5, 6. as one of those who are to be subject to the king, seeming to stand generally as an example of the industrial population. He is also referred to in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 13; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 17; xxx. 6. and in the Brāhmaṇas: 3) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 4, 8; iii. 4, 2, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 2, 17. in all these passages, as well a probably in the Atharvaveda also, the Rathakāra already forms a caste. The later system 4) Yājñavalkya, i. 95. On the special position, in the later ritual, of the Rathakāra as a caste below the Vaiśya, but superior to the Śūdra, cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 12, 13, and cf. Varṇa, see also Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 209, 210. regards the Rathakāra as the offspring of a Māhiṣya (the son of a Kṣatriya husband and a Vaiśya wife) and a Karaṇī (the daughter of a Vaiśya husband and a Śūdra wife), but it is unreasonable to suppose that such an origin is historically accurate. The Rathakāras must rather be deemed to have been a functional caste. Hillebrandt 5) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 152, 153. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 196 et seq. suggests that the Anu tribe formed the basis of the Rathakāra caste, referring to their worship of the Ṛbhus, who are, of course, the chariotmakers par excellence. But there is little ground for this view.

rathagRtsa|रथगृत्स
रथ-गृत्स<BR> in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (xv. 15) and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 48, 9) denotes a ‘skilled charioteer.’ 1) Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 3, 1; kṛtsna, Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 8, 10; kṛtsa, Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 9.

rathachakra|रथचक्र
रथ-चक्र,<BR> ‘chariot wheel,’ is often mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 43, 4; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 6, 8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 3, 12; v. 1, 5, 2; xi. 8, 1, 11, etc. See Ratha and Cakra.

rathacharShaNa|रथचर्षण
रथ-चर्षण<BR> occurs once in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 5, 19. where the sense is doubtful. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. thought that some part of the chariot was meant, but the sense is perhaps only the ‘pathway of the chariot.’ 3) Cf. also the citation and explanation in Durga's commentary on the Nirukta, v. 12.

rathajuuti|रथजूति
रथ-जूति<BR> in the Atharvaveda (xix. 44, 3) is either an adjective meaning ‘driving swiftly in a chariot,’ 1) ‘Of chariot-swiftness’ according to Whitney, Translation of the Athar vaveda, 967. Cf. his note on the passage. or a proper name, as Roth in the St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests. 

rathanaabhi|रथनाभि
रथ-नाभि,<BR> the ‘nave of the chariot-wheel,’ is mentioned in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 1) xxxiv. 5. and in the Upaniṣads. 2) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 5, 5; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 2, 4; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iii. 8; Chāndogya Upaniṣad. vii. 15, 1, etc.

rathaprotadaarbhya|रथप्रोतदार्भ्य
रथ-प्रोत दार्भ्य<BR> (‘descendant of Darbha’) is mentioned in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (ii. 1, 3) perhaps as a king, but possibly as a priest.

rathaproShTha|रथप्रोष्ठ
रथ-प्रोष्ठ<BR> occurs as the name of a princely family in the Rigveda (x. 60, 5). See Subandhu.

rathamukha|रथमुख
रथ-मुख<BR> in the later Saṃhitās 1) Av. viii. 8, 23; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 3, 2; v. 4, 9, 3, etc. denotes the fore-part of a chariot. Cf. Rathaśīrṣa.

ratharvii|रथर्वी
रथर्वी<BR> is the name of a snake in the Atharvaveda (x. 4, 5).

rathavaahana|रथवाहन
रथ-वाहन<BR> is the name in the Rigveda 1) vi. 75, 8. and later 2) Av. iii. 17, 3 = Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 5, 5 = Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvi. 11 = Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 7, 12 = Vāsiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, ii. 34. 35. See also Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxi. 10; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 9, 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 3, 23 et seq. for a movable stand to hold the chariot. According to Roth, 3) Festgruss an Böhtlingk, 95 et seq.; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 116. it corresponds to the Greek , on which the chariot rested when out of use. The word Rathavāhana-vāha is employed in the sense of the two horses that draw the stand. 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 20, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 4, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 9; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 1. Weber 5) U7ber den Vājapeya, 27, n. 2, followed by Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 275. Weber, however, admits that the Rathavāhana may at times have served as a mere stand, like the Homeric  while Geldner expresses the opinion that it never has that sense. The use of the term Rathavāhanavāha shows that the stand was movable. thinks it was used to convey the war chariot to the scene of action. 

rathaviitidaarbhya|रथवीतिदार्भ्य
रथवीति दार्भ्य<BR> (‘descendant of Darbha’) is mentioned once in the Rigveda 1) v. 61, 17. 19. as residing in places abounding in kine (gomatīr anu) far away among the hills, possibly the Himālayas, and as the patron of the singer of the hymn. Later the tradition 2) See Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 50 et seq., 62, n. 2, and the criticism in Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Neten, 1, 353, 354; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 359, 362. makes him the king, whose daughter Śyāsvāśva won for his wife by his father's and the Maruts' aid.

rathashiirSha|रथशीर्ष
रथ-शीर्ष,<BR> the ‘head of the chariot’--that is, its fore-part -is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ix. 4. 1, 13).

rathasanga|रथसङ्ग
रथ-सङ्ग<BR> in the Rigveda (ix. 53, 2) denotes the hostile encounter of chariots.

rathaaxa|रथाक्ष
रथाक्ष<BR> in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 6, 4, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxix. 8. denotes the ‘axle of the chariot.’ Its length is given by the scholiast on the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra 2) viii. 8, 6. as 104 Aṅgulas (‘finger-breadths’), which agrees with the statement in the Āpastamba Śulba Sūtra. 3) vi. 5 (Bürk, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenläudischen Gesellschaft, 56, 344, 345). See Ratha.

rathaahnya|रथाह्न्य
रथाह्न्य<BR> in the Śatapatha Brāhmana (xii. 2, 3, 12) denotes a ‘day's journey by chariot.’

rathin|रथिन्
रथिन्<BR> and Rathī in the Rigveda 1) Rathin, i. 122, 8; v. 83, 3; vi. 47, 31; viii. 4, 9; x. 40, 5; 51, 6; Rathī, i. 25, 3; ii. 39, 2; iii. 3, 6; v. 87, 8; vii. 39, 1, etc. and later 2) Rathin, Av. iv. 34, 4; vii. 62, 1; 73, 1; xi. 10, 24; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 2, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 26; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, viii. 7, 3, 7, etc.; Rathī, Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 7, 15, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 296. denote ‘one who goes in a chariot,’ an expression which includes both the driver and the warrior who accompanied him. 

rathiitara|रथीतर
रथीतर<BR> (‘good charioteer’) is the name of a teacher mentioned in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 1) xxii. 11. and the Bṛhaddevatā. 2) i. 26; iii. 40; vii. 145 (ed. Macdonell).

ratheShThaa|रथेष्ठा
रथे-ष्ठा,<BR> ‘standing on the chariot,’ denotes in the Rigveda 1) i. 173, 4. 5; ii. 17, 3; vi. 21, 1; 22, 5; 29, 1; viii. 4, 13; 33, 14; ix. 97, 49; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 32 Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 296. the warrior who fights from the chariot, ‘car-fighter.’

rathopastha|रथोपस्थ
रथोपस्थ,<BR> ‘lap of the chariot,’ in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 8, 23. and the Brāhmaṇas 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 10, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 3, 12, etc. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 238, n. seems to denote the ‘bottom’ or lower part on which the driver and the fighter stand.

randhra|रन्ध्र
रन्ध्र<BR> seems, in the phrase Ukṣṇo Randhra occurring in one passage of the Rigveda (viii. 7, 26), to be the name of a place, but the sense is very doubtful. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 9, 13) Ukṣṇo randhra is the name of a man.

rabhi|रभि
रभि,<BR> occurring once in the Rigveda (viii. 5, 29), designates some part of the chariot. The term perhaps means ‘supporting shaft.’

rambha|रम्भ
रम्भ<BR> seems to mean a ‘staff’ or ‘support’ in one passage of the Rigveda (viii. 45, 20). In another place (ii. 15, 9) a man is described as Rambhin, apparently as carrying a staff to support himself in old age; Sāyaṇa explains this word as ‘door-keeper’ (like one of the senses of daṇḍin, ‘staff-bearer,’ in later Sanskrit).

rambhiNii|रम्भिणी
रम्भिणी<BR> occurs in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 168, 3. Cf. i. 167, 3, and see Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 283. as being on the shoulders of the Maruts. A ‘spear’ seems to be meant, perhaps conceived as clinging (rambh = rabk, ‘clasp’) to the shoulders of a man. 

rayi|रयि
रयि<BR> is the common word for ‘wealth’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 73, 1; 159, 4; ii. 21, 6; iii. 1, 19; iv. 2, 7; 34, 10; 36, 9; vi. 6, 7; 31, 1, etc. and later. 2) Av. iii. 14, 1; vi. 33, 3; vii. 80, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 72; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ix. 22; xiv. 22; xxvii. 6, etc. Special mention is often made of wealth in ‘heroes’ (vīra)--i.e., in ‘good sons,’ 3) Rv. ii. 11. 13; 30, 11; iv. 51, 10, etc. in horses, 4) Rv. v. 41, 5; viii. 6, 9, etc. in cattle, 5) Rv. v. 4, 11, etc. etc.

rashanaa|रशना
रशना<BR> means generally ‘cord’ or ‘rope.’ In the Rigveda the word ofter refers to various fastenings of a horse. In one passage 1) i. 162, 8. Cf. Rajju. the expression śīrṣaṇyā raśanā, ‘head rope,’ perhaps means not so much ‘reins’ as ‘headstall.’ In others 2) Rv. i. 163, 2. 5; x. 79, 7. the sense of ‘traces’ seems certain, though sometimes 3) Rv. iv. 1. 9; ix. 87, 1; x. 18, 14. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 4, 3. ‘reins’ or ‘traces’ may equally well be intended. Elsewhere the more general sense of ‘rope’ for stening is meant. 4) Rv. ii. 28, 5; Av. viii. 78, 1; x. 9, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 46; xxii. 2; xxviii. 33; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 6. 4, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 6, 3. 10, etc. Cf. the use of Raśanā as equivalent to ‘finger’ in Rv. x. 4, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 249.

rashmi|रश्मि
1. Raśmi is not rarely found in the sense of ‘rope’ 1) Rv. i. 28, 4; iv. 22, 8; viii. 25, 18, etc.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 19, 3, etc. generally; but more usually it denotes either the ‘reins’ or the ‘traces’ 2) Rv. viii. 7, 8; x. 130, 7, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 4, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 14; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 4, 2, etc. In Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 37, 1, the two inner (antarau) reins or traces of the chariot are mentioned. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 249. of a chariot, either sense being equally good in most passages.

rashmi|रश्मि
2. Raśmi in the Rigveda 1) i. 35, 7; iv. 52, 7; vii. 36, 1; 77, 3, etc. and later 2) Av. ii. 32, 1; xii. 1, 15; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 1, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ix. 2, 3, 14, etc. regularly denotes a ‘ray’ of the sun. 

rasaa|रसा
रसा<BR> is found in three passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 112, 12; v. 53, 9; x. 75, 6. In v. 53, 9, the phrase rasānitabhā is found. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 202, is inclined to regard anitabhā as an epithet of Rasā, perhaps for amitabhā, ‘of unmeasured splendour,’ but this is hardly probable. It seems better to take Anitabhā as the name of an otherwise unknown river. Cf. Max Müller, India, 166, 173, n. clearly as the name of a real stream in the extreme north-west of the Vedic territory. Elsewhere 2) Rv. v. 41, 15; ix. 41, 6; x. 100, 1, 2 (cf. Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 348; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 100 et seq.); 121, 4. it is the name of a mythic stream at the ends of the earth, which as well as the atinosphere it encompasses. It is reasonable to assume that, as in the case of the Sarasvatī, the literal is the older sense, and to see in the river a genuine stream, perhaps originally the Araxes or Jaxartes, because the Vendidad mentions the Raṅhā, the Avestan form of Rasā. But the word seems originally to allude merely to the ‘sap’ or ‘flavour’ of the waters, 3) Rv. iv. 43, 6; viii. 72, 13. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 15, 16; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 323; Brunnhofer, Iran und Turan, 86; Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1898, 567-569. and so could be applied to every river, like Sarasvatī.

rasaashir|रसाशिर्
रसाशिर्<BR> as an epithet of Soma in the Rigveda 1) iii. 48, 1, where Sāyaṇa explains rasa as ‘milk.’ Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 211, n. 5. means ‘mixed with juice’--i.e., with milk.

rahasuu|रहसू
रह-सू,<BR> ‘bearing in secret,’ is a term applied in one passage of the Rigveda (ii. 29, 1) to an unmarried mother. Cf. Pati and Dharma.

rahasyudevamalimluch|रहस्युदेवमलिम्लुच्
रहस्यु देव-मलिम्लुच्<BR> is the name, in the Pañcavimśa Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 4, 7), of a mythical person who at Munimaraṇa slew the saintly Vaikhānases.

rahuugaNa|रहूगण
रहू-गण<BR> is the name of a family mentioned in the plural in one passage of the Rigveda. 1) i. 78, 5. According to Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 110. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen, Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 236, n. 1. they were connected with the Gotamas, as is shown by the name Gotama Rāhūgaṇa. 

raakaa|राका
राका<BR> in the Rigveda 1) ii. 32, 4; v. 42, 12. and later 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 8, 1; iii. 4, 9, 1. 6; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 8; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 37, 2, 6; 47, 4, etc.; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 13, 1. etc. denotes the full moon day as a personification. Cf. Candramās.

raajakartR|राजकर्तृ
राज-कर्तृ,<BR> 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 17, 5. or Rāja-kṛt, 2) Av. iii. 5, 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 1, 7; xiii. 2, 2, 18. ‘king-maker,’ is the term applied in the Atharvaveda and the Brāhmaṇas to those who, ‘not themselves kings,’ 3) Loc. cit. aid in the consecration of the king. In the Śatapatha 2) Av. iii. 5, 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 1, 7; xiii. 2, 2, 18. the persons meant and specified are the Sūta, ‘charioteer,’ and the Grāmaṇī, ‘village chief,’ probably a representative chief from the village nearest to the place of consecration, as Eggeling 4) Sacred Books of the East, 41, 60, n. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 199 et seq. suggests. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 17. 5. according to the commentator's explanation, the father, brother, etc., are meant; in the Atharvaveda, 2) Av. iii. 5, 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 1, 7; xiii. 2, 2, 18. also, the meaning of the expression is not stated in the text.

raajakula|राजकुल
राज-कुल,<BR> a ‘kingly family,’ is mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 28, 4), where, it is to be noted, such a family is ranked after, not before, a Brāhmaṇa Kula, a ‘Brahmin family.’

raajan|राजन्
1. Rājan, ‘king,’ is a term repeatedly occurring in the Rigveda 1) iii. 43, 5; v. 54, 7, etc. and the later literature. 2) Av. iv. 22, 3. 5; viii. 7, 16, etc. It is quite clear that the normal, though not universal form of government, in early India was that by kings, as might be expected in view of the fact that the Āryan Indians were invaders in a hostile territory: a situation which, as in the case of the Āryan invaders of Greece and of the German invaders of England, resulted almost necessarily in strengthening the monarchic element of the constitution. 3) Cf. Stubbs, Constitutional History of England, 59 et seq. The mere patriarchal organization of society is not sufficient, as Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 162. assumes, to explain the Vedic kingship. Tenure of Monarchy.--Zimmer 5) Op. cit., 162 et seq. So Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 188; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 336. is of opinion that while the Vedic monarchy was sometimes hereditary, as is indeed shown by several cases where the descent can be traced, 6) E.g., Vadhryaśva, Divodāsa, Pijavana, Sudās; or Purukutsa, Trasadasyu, Mitrātithi, Kuruśravaṇa Upamaśravas, etc.; Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 386. So a ‘kingdom of ten generations’ (Daśapuruṣaṃrājya) is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 9, 3, 3; and cf. v. 4, 2, 8; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 12. 17. yet in others the monarchy was elective, though it is not clear whether the selection by the people was between the members of the royal family only or extended to members of all the noble clans. It must, however, be admitted that the evidence for the elective monarchy is not strong. As Geldner 7) Vedische Studien, 2, 303. argues, all the passages cited 8) Rv. x. 124, 8; 173; Av. i. 9; iii. 4; iv. 22. can be regarded not as choice by the cantons (Viś), but as acceptance by the subjects (viś): this seems the more probable sense. Of course this is no proof that the monarchy was not sometimes elective: the practice of selecting one member of the family to the exclusion of another less well qualified is exemplified by the legend in Yāska 9) Nirukta, ii. 10. of the Kuru brothers, Devāpi and Śantanu, the value of which, as evidence of contemporary views, is not seriously affected by the legend itself being of dubious character and validity. Royal power was clearly insecure: there are several references to kings being expelled from their realms, and their efforts to recover their sovereignty, 10) The technical term is apa-ruddha. Cf. Av. iii. 3, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxviii. 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 1; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xii. 12, 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 9, 3, 3, etc.; Kauśika Sūtra, xvi. 30; Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, 37 et seq. and the Atharvaveda contains spells in the interest of royalty. 11) Especially iii. 3. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 111 et seq. The King in War.--Naturally the Vedic texts, after the Rigveda, contain few notices of the warlike adventures that no doubt formed a very considerable proportion of the royal functions. But the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 12) i. 8, 4, 1. contains the statement that the Kuru-Pañcāla kings, who, like the Brahmins of those tribes, stand as representatives of good form, used to make their raids in the dewy season. The word Udāja, too, with its variant Nirāja, records that kings took a share of the booty of war. The Rigveda 13) E.g., the Dāśarājña, Rv. vii. 18. 33, 83, and cf. Rv. iii. 33, 53. has many references to Vedic wars: it is clear that the Kṣatriyas were at least as intent on fulfilling their duty of war as the Brahmins on sacrificing and their other functions. Moreover, beside offensive war, defence was a chief duty of the king: he is emphatically the ‘protector of the tribe’ (gopā janasya), or, as is said in the Rājasūya (‘royal consecration’), ‘protector of the Brahmin.’ 14) Rv. iii. 43, 5. References to attacks on aborigines are common in the Rigveda--e.g., ii. 12, 11; iv. 26, 3; vi. 26, 5; 33, 4, etc. For later references to war, cf. Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, ix. 17; x. 3; xxviii. 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 4, 8, 3; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, v. 5; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 4, 2 et seq.; and Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 187, 215. In the Rājasūya the protection of the Brahmin is compensated with the ‘eating’ of the Viś, the latter interesting the king more than the older duty of protection. See Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 12. 17. His Purohita was expected to use his spells and charms to secure the success of his king's arms. The king no doubt fought in person: so Pratardana met death in war according to the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad; 15) iii. 1. and in the Rājasūya the king is invoked as ‘sacker of cities’ (purāṃ bhettā). The King in Peace.--In return for his warlike services the king received the obedience 16) See, e.g., Janaka's offer of the Videhas as slaves to Yājñavalkya, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 4, 30, and see ibid., ii. 1, 20; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 6, 10, etc.; Rv. i. 67, 1; iv. 50, 8.<BR> --sometimes forced 17) Rv. ix. 7, 5. Cf. vii. 6, 5, etc.; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 18, 2.<BR> --of the people, and in particular their contributions for the maintenance of royalty. The king is regularly 18) See Bali, and cf. Rv. i. 65, 4; Av. iv. 22, 7; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 29; viii. 12. 17; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, iv. 12; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 2, 17; iv. 2, 1, 3, 17; v. 3, 3, 12; 4, 2, 3; x. 6, 2, 1; xiii. 2, 9, 6, 8, etc.; Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 93, n.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 246; Pischel and Geldner, Vedische Stadien, 1, xvi; Winternitz, Geschichte der indischen Litteratur, 1, 173, 174; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 161. It is to this form of taxation that the share of village (grāme), horses (aśveṣu), and kine (goṣu) of Av. iv. 22, 2, is to be referred. It is significant that the village and cattle are put on the same footing, as tending to refute the argument that the king was supreme landowner. See n. 31 below. For the rate of taxation, which later was one sixth, cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 85, 86; India, Old and New, 238 et seq.; 333; Mrs. Rhys Davids, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1901, 860. regarded as ‘devouring the people,’ but this phrase must not be explained as meaning that he necessarily oppressed them. It obviously has its origin in a custom by which the king and his retinue were fed by the people's contributions, a plan with many parallels. It is also probable that the king could assign the royal right of maintenance to a Kṣatriya, thus developing a nobility supported by the people. Taxation would not normally fall on Kṣatriya or Brahmin; the texts contam emphatic assertions of the exemption of the goods of the latter from the royal bounty. 19) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 6, 2, 18; 7, 1, 13. See also Brāhmaṇa (above, 2, 83) for the claim of the Brahmins to serve only king Soma, not the temporal king.In the people, however, lay the strength of the king. 20) Cf., e.g., Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 8; iii. 11, 8; iv. 4, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 4, 11; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 5. See also Bali. In return the king performed the duties of judge. Himself immune from punishment (a-daṇḍya), he wields the rod of punishment (Daṇḍa). 21) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 4, 7. It is probable that criminal justice remained largely in his actual administration, for the Sūtras 22) E.g., Gautama Dharma Sūtra, xii. 43 et seq. preserve clear traces of the personal exercise of royal criminal jurisdiction. Possibly the jurisdiction could be exercised by a royal officer, or even by a delegate, for a Rājanya is mentioned as an overseer (adhyakṣa) of the punishment of a Śūdra in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 23) xxvii. 4. Cf. Kṣatriya, n. 18. In civil justice it may be that the king played a much less prominent part, save as a court of final appeal, but evidence is lacking on this head. The Madhyamaśī of the Rigveda was probably not a royal, but a private judge or arbitrator. A wide criminal jurisdiction is, however, to some extent supported 24) Cf. Rv. i. 25, 13; iv. 4, 3; vi. 67, 5; vii. 61, 3; 87, 3; x. 10, 8 (= Av. xviii. 1, 9); Av. iv. 16, 4. by the frequent mention of Varuṇa's spies, for Varuṇa is the divine counterpart of the human king. 25) See Foy, Die kōnigliche Gewalt, 80 et seq. Possibly such spies could be used in war also. 26) Cf. Rv. viii. 47, 11; Foy, op. cit., 84. The reference is not certain. There is no reference in early Vedic literature to the exercise of legislative activitv by the king, though later it is an essential part of his duties. 27) See Foy, op. cit., chap. iii. Nor can we say exactly what executive functions devolved on the king. In all his acts the king was regularly advised by his Purohita; he also had the advantage of the advice of the royal ministers and attendants (see Ratnin). The local administration was entrusted to the Grāmaṇī, or village chief, who may have been selected or appointed by the king. The outward signs of the king's rank were his palace 28) Cf. Varuṇa's palace, Rv. ii. 41, 5; vii. 88, 5. The throne, Āsandī, is used to form the name of Janamejaya's royal city, Asandīvant. Cf. also Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 4, 1 et seq.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 12, 3-5. and his brilliant dress. 29) See, e.g., Rv. i. 85, 8; viii. 5, 38; x. 78, 1, etc. So the king is the great lord of riches (dhana-patir dhanānām), Av. iv. 22, 3, and in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 31, he is likened to the Nyagrodha tree. The King as Landowner.--The position of the king with regard to the land is somewhat obscure. The Greek notices, 30) See Diodorus, ii. 40; Arrian, Indica, 11; Strabo, p. 703, and Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 87 et seq. in which, unhappily, it would be dangerous to put much trust, since they were collected by observers who were probably little used to accurate investigations of such matters, and whose statements were based on inadequate information, vary in their statements. In part they speak of rent being paid, and declare that only the king and no private person could own land, while in part they refer to the taxation of land. Hopkins 31) India, Old and New, 221 et seq. is strongly of opinion that the payments made were paid for protection -i.e., in modern terminology as a tax, but that the king was recognized as the owner of all the land, while yet the individual or the joint family also owned the land. As against BadenPowell, 32) Village Communities in India, 145; Indian Village Community, 207 et seq. who asserted that the idea of the king as a landowner was later, he urges for the Vedic period that the king, as we have seen, is described as devouring the people, and that, according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 33) vii. 29, 3. the Vaiśya can be devoured at will and maltreated (but, unlike the Śūdra, not killed); and for the period of the legal Sūtras and Śāstras he cites Bṛhaspati and Nārada as clearly recognizing the king's overlordship, besides a passage of the Mānava Dharma Śāstra 34) viii. 39. which describes the king as ‘lord of all,’ a phrase which Bühler 35) In his note on Manu, loc. cit., Sacred Books of the East, 25, 259. was inclined to interpret as a proof of landowning. The evidence is, however, inadequate to prove what is sought. It is not denied that gradually the king came to be vaguely conceived--as the English king still is--as lord of all the land in a proprietorial sense, but it is far more probable that such an idea was only a gradual development than that it was primitive. The power of devouring the people is a political power, not a right of ownership; precisely the same feature can be traced in South Africa, 36) See Keith, Journal of the African Society, 6, 202 et seq. The evidence, so far as it goes, of other Āryan peoples does not support the theory of original kingly ownership. Such ownership did not exist, as far as can be seen, in Anglo-Saxon times (English Historical Review, viii. 1-7). nor in Homeric Greece (Lang, Homer and His Age, 236 et seq.), nor at Rome. where the chief can deprive a man arbitrarily of his land, though the land is really owned by the native. The matter is ultimately to some extent one of terminology, but the parallel cases are in favour of distinguishing between the political rights of the crown, which can be transferred by way of a grant, and the rights of ownership. Hopkins 37) Loc. cit. thinks that the gifts of land to priests, which seems to be the first sign of land transactions in the Brāhmaṇas, was an actual gift of land; it may have been so in many cases, but it may easily also have been the grant of a superiority: the Epic grants are hardly decisive one way or the other. For the relations of the king with the assembly, see Sabhā; for his consecration, see Rājasūya. A-rāja-tā, ‘lack of a king,’ means ‘anarchy.’ 38) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 9, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 14, 6; Lévi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 74. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 162 et seq.; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 84 et seq.; Foy, Die königliche Gewalt nach den Dharmasūtren (Leipzig, 1895); Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 46 et seq.; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1901, 860, 861.

raajan|राजन्
2. Rājan in several passages-means no more than a ‘noble of the ruling house,’ or perhaps even merely a ‘noble,’ there being 1 Cf. Rv. i. 40, 8; 108, 7; x. 42, 10; 97, 6; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 6, 8, 3; v. 7, 6, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xl. 13; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 48; xxvi. 2; Av. xix. 62, 1, and possibly ii. 6, 4, etc.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 236, 237. Possibly rājñaḥ in Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 5, may be taken in this sense. The king there is said to be a non-Āryan, but the reading is corrupt, and Oertel's conjecture is not probable. Cf. Rājya, n. 2. no decisive passage. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 176, 177. sees traces in one passage of the Rigveda 3) x. 97, 6. He also compares Av. i. 9; iii. 4; iv. 22, where the king is referred to as superior to the other royal personages. that in times of peace there was no king in some states, the members of the royal family holding equal rights. He compares this with the state of affairs in early Germany. 4) The case of the Cherusci and Arminius' attempt to make himself king, which his relatives, the royal family, foiled (see Tacitus, Annals, ii. 88). But the passage merely shows that the nobles could be called Rājan, and is not decisive for the sense ascribed to it by Zimmer. Of course this state of affairs is perfectly possible, and is exemplified later in Buddhist times. 5) Cf. Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 19.

raajani|राजनि
राजनि,<BR> ‘descendant of Rajana,’ is the patronymic of Ugradeva in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 3, 17; xxiii. 16, 11) and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (v. 4. 12).

raajanya|राजन्य
राजन्य<BR> is the regular term in Vedic literature 1) Only once in the Rv. in the late Puruṣa-sūkta, x. 90, 12; but often in the Av.: v. 17, 9; 18, 2; vi. 38, 4; x. 10, 18; xii. 4, 32 et seq.; xv. 8, 1; xix. 32, 8; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 13, 1; 5, 4, 4; 10, 1; v. 1, 10, 3, etc. Even in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, where, on the whole, the later use of Kṣatriya prevails, the Rājanya is often mentioned. See Eggeling's index, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 561. for a man of the royal family, probably including also those who were not actually members of that family, but were nobles, though it may have been originally restricted to members of the royal family. This, however, does not appear clearly from any passage; the term may originally have applied to all the nobles irrespective of kingly power. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) Cf. xiii. 4, 2, 17, with xiii. 1, 6, 2. the Rājanya is different from the Rājaputra, who is literally a son of the king. The functions and place of the Rājanya are described under Kṣatriya, which expression later normally takes the place of Rājanya as a designation for the ruling class. His high place is shown by the fact that in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 3) ii. 5, 4, 4. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 258 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 191. It is quite likely that the noble families not related to the royal family were families of minor princes whose rule was merged in that of the king on the formation of a powerful tribe, as was the case in Germany. he is ranked with the learned Brahmin and the Grāmaṇī (who was a Vaiśya) as having reached the height of prosperity (gata-śrī).

raajanyabandhu|राजन्यबन्धु
राजन्य-बन्धु<BR> denotes a Rājanya, but usually with a depreciating sense. Thus in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xi. 6, 2, 5. Janaka is called by the Brahmins, whom he defeated in disputation, ‘a fellow of a Rājanya’; the same description is applied to Pravāhaṇa Jaivali in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2) vi. 1, 5. for a similar reason. On the other hand, in one passage 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 5, 2. 10, where cf. Eggeling's note, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 370, n. 1. A similar case is apparently i. 2, 4, 2, where any special contempt cannot be meant. where reference is made to men eating apart from women, princes are said to do so most of all: the term Rājanyabandhu cannot here be deemed to be contemptuous, unless, indeed, it is the expression of Brahmin contempt for princes, such as clearly appears in the treatment of Nagnajit in another passage. 4) viii. 1, 4, 10. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 515. Again, in a passage 5) i. 1, 4, 12. in which the four castes are mentioned, the Vaiśya precedes the Rājanyabandhu, a curious inversion of the order of the second and third castes. 6) Eggeling, op. cit., 12, 28.

raajanyarShi|राजन्यर्षि
राजन्य-र्षि,<BR> ‘royal sage,’ is a term applied to Sindhukṣit in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xii. 12, 6. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 235, n. 3, and see Varṇa (p. 261). The story about him is, however, purely mythical.

raajapati|राजपति
राज-पति,<BR> ‘lord of kings,’ is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xi. 4, 3, 9) as an epithet of Soma. It is not used elsewhere as a title of imperial temporal supremacy: see Rājya. 

raajapitR|राजपितृ
राज-पितृ<BR> is one of the titles given to the king in the rite of the Rājasūya (‘royal consecration’) according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 12, 5; 17, 5). It probably designates the king as ‘father of a king,’ and indicates the hereditary character of the monarchy. Possibly the later plan 1) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 139. The sense of ‘having a king as father’ is also possible. of associating the king's son in the monarchy prevailed in earlier times also.

raajaputra|राजपुत्र
राज-पुत्र,<BR> ‘king's son,’ ‘prince,’ seems to be capable of being interpreted literally in every passage of the older literature 1) Rv. x. 40, 3; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 17, 6 (of Viśvāmitra, but probably in a mythical sense); Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xix. 1, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiv. 8; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 5, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 2, 5; 5, 2, 5, etc. in which it is found, though it may also be capable of a wider interpretation. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxviii. 1, may be cited as identifying the Rājanya and the Rājaputra. Later the Rājaputra degenerates into a mere ‘landowner.’ 3) Jolly, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 50, 514, who points out that in the Rājataraṅgiṇī, vii. 360, traces of the older position of the Rājaputra are seen.

raajapuruSha|राजपुरुष
राज-पुरुष<BR> denotes a ‘royal servant’ in the Nirukta (ii. 3). Cf. Pūruṣa.

raajabhraatR|राजभ्रातृ
राज-भ्रातृ,<BR> the ‘brother of the king,’ is mentioned as one of the eight Vīras, or supporters of the monarchy, in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xix. 1, 4. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 30, n. 2. He is also alluded to elsewhere. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 13, 18, etc.

raajamaatra|राजमात्र
राज-मात्र<BR> is found in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (xxvii. 6) and the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xvii. 5, 3. 4; 15, 3), where it seems to include ‘the whole class of persons (who could be called) Rājan’--i.e., the Rājaputras and the Rājanyas. 

raajayaxma|राजयक्ष्म
राज-यक्ष्म,<BR> ‘royal sickness,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) i. 161, 1. and several times later on. 2) Av. xi. 3, 39; xii. 5; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 5, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 3; xxvii. 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 7. Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 375 et seq. identifies it with consumption: this identification seems certain, being supported by the later view of the disease. 4) Cf. Wise, System of Hindu Medicine, 321 et seq.; Jolly, Medicin, 88, 89, n. 2, who takes Rājayakṣma as denoting the worst of diseases, not the disease cured by the king. Cf. Rājāśva. Bloomfield 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 697. But contrast ibid., 415. suggests ‘king's evil,’ or syphilis, as the sense, but this is not probable.

raajasuuya|राजसूय
राज-सूय<BR> is the name in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 8, 1; xi. 7, 7. and the later literature 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 2, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 15, 8; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 1, 12, etc. of the ceremony of the ‘royal consecration.’ The rite is described at great length in the Sūtras, 3) See Weber, U7ber die Königsweihe, den Rājasūya; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 144-147; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 472, 491. The relation of the Śunaḥśepa episode formed part of the ritual. That this points to human sacrifice having once formed part of the ritual of the Rājasūya as supposed by Hillebrandt, loc. cit.; Weber, 47; and Oldenberg, 366, n. 1, seems very doubtful. Cf. Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 844, 845. but its main features are clearly outlined in the Brāhmaṇas, 4) Especially Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 3, 1 et seq. See also Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 1 et seq.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 1, 1 et seq. while the verses used in the ceremony are preserved in the Saṃhitās of the Yajurveda. 5) See Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. Besides much mere priestly elaboration, the ritual contains traces of popular ceremonial. For example, the king is clothed in the ceremonial garments of his rank, and provided with bow and arrow as emblems of sovereignty. He is formally anointed; he performs a mimic cow raid against a relative of his; 6) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 3, 1 et seq. or engages in a sham fight with a Rājanya. 7) Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 15 with commentary; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 100, n. 1. A game of dice is played in which he is made to be the victim; 8) See 2. Akṣa (p. 3) he symbolically ascends the quarters of the sky as an indication of his universal rule; and steps on a tiger skin, thus gaining the strength and the pre-eminence of the tiger. A list of the consecrated kings is given in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 9) viii. 21-23. Cf. Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 8. where the royal inauguration is called the ‘great unction’ (mahābhiṣeka) connected with Indra. It corresponds generally with a list of Aśvamedhins, ‘performers of the horse sacrifice,’ given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10) xiii. 5, 4. and the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra. 11) xvi. 9. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, xxiv, xxv.

raajastambaayana|राजस्तम्बायन
राज-स्तम्बायन,<BR> ‘descendant of Rājastamba,’ is the patronymic of Yajñavacas in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) x. 4, 2, 1 (oxytone), 6, 5, 9 (proparoxytone). No stress need be laid on the accents of the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa.

raajaadhiraaja|राजाधिराज
राजाधिराज,<BR> ‘king of kings,’ later a title of paramount sovereignty, is only found in Vedic literature in the late Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (i. 31, 6) as a divine epithet.

raajaashva|राजाश्व
राजाश्व<BR> (‘king's horse’) in the Atharvaveda (vi. 102, 2) seems merely to denote a powerful horse.

raaJNii|राज्ञी
राज्ञी,<BR> ‘queen,’ is found in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 6, 2; 4, 2, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 8, 3, 9; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 3, 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 13; xv. 10. and in the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 6, 2; iii. 11, 3, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 23, 2, etc.

raajya|राज्य
राज्य<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 4, 2; iv. 8, 1; xi. 6, 15; xii. 3, 31; xviii. 4, 31. and later 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 3, 4; 6, 6, 5; vii. 5, 8, 3, etc.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 23, etc.; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 5, as emended by Roth, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, ccxliii. regularly denotes ‘sovereign power,’ from which, as the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3) v. 1, 1, 12. notes, the Brahmin is excluded. In addition to Rājya, the texts give other expressions of sovereign power. Thus the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 4) v. 1, 1, 3. contends that the Rājasūya sacrifice is that of a king, the Vājapeya that of a Samrāj or emperor, the status of the latter (Sāmrājya) being superior to that of the former (Rājya). The sitting on a throne (Āsandī) is given in the same text 5) xii. 8, 3, 4. as one of the characteristics of the Samrāj. Elsewhere 6) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiv. 5; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 11, 5. Cf. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 2, 2. Svārājya, ‘uncontrolled dominion,’ is opposed to Rājya. In the ritual of the Rājasūya the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 7) viii. 12, 4. 5. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvii. 16, 3. gives a whole series of terms: Rājya, Sāmrājya, Bhaujya, Svārājya, Vairājya, Pārameṣṭhya, and Māhārājya, while Ādhipatya, ‘supreme power,’ is found elsewhere. 8) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xv. 3, 35; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 2, 6. But there is no reason to believe that these terms refer to essentially different forms of authority. A king might be called a Mahārāja or a Samrāj, without really being an overlord of kings; he would be so termed if he were an important sovereign, or by his own entourage out of compliment, as was Janaka of Videha. 9) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 3, 1, 2. 6; 2, 2, 3, etc. That a really great monarchy of the Aśoka or Gupta type ever existed in the Vedic period seems highly improbable. 10) Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 30.

raatrii|रात्री
रात्री<BR> is the most usual word in the Rigveda 1) i. 35, 1; 94, 7; 113, 1, etc. and later 2) Av. i. 16, 1; v. 5, 1, etc. for ‘night.’ Cf. Māsa.

raathiitara|राथीतर
राथीतर,<BR> ‘descendant of Rathītara,’ is the patronymic of Satyavacas in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad (i. 9, 1), and occurs several times as the name of a teacher in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (vii. 4, etc.).

raathiitariiputra|राथीतरीपुत्र
राथीतरी-पुत्र,<BR> ‘son of a female descendant of Rathītara,’ is the name of a teacher in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, the pupil of Bhālukī-putra, according to the Kāṇva recension (vi. 5, 1), of the Krauñcikīputras according to the Mādhyaṃdina (vi. 4, 32). 

raadhagautama|राधगौतम

raama|राम
1. Rāma is the name of a man in the Rigveda. 1) x. 93, 14. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166. thinks that he bore the patronymic Māyava, 3) Rv. x. 93, 15. but this is doubtful.

raamamaargaveya|राममार्गवेय
4. Rāma Mārga-veya is the name of a man of the priestly family of the Śyāparṇas in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 1) vii. 27, 3. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 345, n.; Muir Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 438.

raahuugaNa|राहूगण
राहू-गण,<BR> ‘descendant of Rahū-gaṇa,’ is the patronymic of Gotama in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) 1. 4, 1, 10. 18; xi. 4, 3, 20. Cf. also Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 81, 3; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 151, 152; Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 8.

raibhya|रैभ्य
रैभ्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Rebha,’ is the name of a teacher in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 26), where he is said to be a pupil of Pautimāṣyāyaṇa and Kauṇḍinyāyana.

On Av. i. 22, 4, he explains it as kāṣṭhaśuka, perhaps a kind of parrot. but Keśava, the commentator on the Kauśika Sūtra, 4) xxvi. 20. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 92; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 266; Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, 76, n. 13; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 23. is inclined to understand the word to mean a sort of wood.

According to the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 3) Loc. cit. it was to be made under the Nakṣatra Revatī, clearly because of the property indicated in the name (‘wealthy’) of that Nakṣatra. See Aṣṭakarṇī. 

laxmaNya|लक्ष्मण्य
लक्ष्मण्य<BR> in one verse of the Rigveda 1) v. 33, 10. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155. seems to be a patronymic of Dhvanya, ‘son of Lakṣmaṇa.’

laxman|लक्ष्मन्
लक्ष्मन्<BR> See Lakṣaṇa.

laba|लब
लब,<BR> ‘quail’ (Perdix chinensis) is one of the victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 24. Cf. Nirukta, vii. 2, where Rv. x. 119 is called the Labasūkta; the Anukramaṇī (Index), too, gives Aindra Laba as the author of that hymn. Cf. Bṛhaddevatā, viii. 40, with Macdonell's note. Cf.

लवण,<BR> ‘salt,’ is never mentioned in the Rigveda, only once in the Atharvaveda, 1) vii. 76, 1. and not after that until the latest part of the Brāhmaṇas, 2) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 17, 7 = Jaiminīya Upaniṣad, iii. 17, 3. Cf. also Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 13, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 4, 12; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 1, 16; and see Strabo, xv. 1, 30. where it is regarded as of extremely high value. 3) It seems to be placed above gold in value in Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 17, 7. This silence in the early period is somewhat surprising if the regions then occupied by the Indians were the Panjab and the Indus valley, where salt abounds; it would at first sight seem less curious if the home of the early Vedic Indian is taken to be Kurukṣetra. 4) Cf. Map 19 in the Atlas of the Imperial Gazetteer of India, vol. 26, and see Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 21 et seq.; India, Old and New, 30 et seq. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 54, 55; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 318; Geiger, Ostiranische Kultur, 419; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 150. It is, however, quite conceivable that a necessary commodity might happen to be passed over without literary mention in a region where it is very common, but to be referred to in a locality where it is not found, and consequently becomes highly prized.

loka|लोक
लोक<BR> denotes ‘world’ in the Rigveda 1) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2, quotes no example of this meaning for the Rigveda, where he sees the word used only in the sense of ‘place,’ ‘room,’ ‘free or open space.’ But Rv. x. 14, 9, is a fairly certain example of the wider sense. and later. 2) Av. viii. 9, 1. 15; iv. 38, 5; xi. 5, 7; 8, 10, etc.; in ix. 5, 14, the worlds of heaven (divya) and of earth (pārthiva) are distinguished; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxii. 11 et seq., etc. Mention is often made of the three worlds, 3) Av. x. 6, 31; xii. 3, 20; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 8; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 1, 7, 3, etc. and ayaṃ lokaḥ, ‘this world,’ 4) Av. v. 30, 17; viii. 8, 8; xii. 5, 38; xix. 54, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 46, etc. is constantly opposed to asau lokaḥ, 5) Av. xii. 5, 38. 57; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 5, 9, 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 28, 2; viii. 2, 3, etc. ‘yonder world’ -i.e., ‘heaven.’ Loka itself sometimes means ‘heaven,’ 6) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 1, 7; x. 5, 4, 16; xi. 2, 7, 19; and so probably Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 13, 12. while in other passages several different sorts of world are mentioned. 7) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvi. 4; Kauṣī taki Brāhmaṇa, xx. 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 6, 1; iv. 3, 36 et seq.; vi. 1, 18, etc.

lodha|लोध
लोध<BR> occurs in a very obscure verse of the Rigveda, 1) iii. 53, 23. where Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. conjectures that some sort of ‘red’ animal is meant, and Oldenberg 3) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 255. Cf. the obscure adhī-lodha-karṇa in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 16, 1, perhaps meaning ‘having quite red ears.’ Yāska, Nirukta, iv. 12, equates the word with lubdha, ‘confused,’ but this does not suit the context. So also Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 84; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 160; Ṛgveda, Glossar, 151, who sees in the word the designation of a noble steed. shows some reason for thinking that a ‘red goat’ is intended.

lopaa|लोपा
लोपा<BR> is mentioned in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 1) v. 5, 18, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93. where Sāyaṇa explains it as a kind of bird, perhaps the carrion crow (śmaśānaśakuni). 

lopaamudraa|लोपामुद्रा

It also occurs several times in the Brāhmaṇas. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2, 2, 18; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 17, 7; vi. 1, 5; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 4, where Oertel takes ‘copper’ to be meant in contrast with Ayas, which he renders ‘brass.’ The sense of ‘iron’ is nowhere needed. Cf. Vincent Smith, Indian Antiquary, 34, 230; and on the early history of metals; Mosso, Mediterranean Civilization, 57-62. See Ayas.

lohamaNi|लोहमणि
लोह-मणि<BR> in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (vi. 2, 5) denotes a ‘copper amulet,’ as Böhtlingk 1) Cf. Little, Grammatical Index, 134. renders it, rather than a ‘lump of gold,’ as translated by Max Müller following the scholiast.

lohaayasa|लोहायस

lauhitya|लौहित्य
लौहित्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Lohita,’ is the patronymic of a large number of teachers in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, which clearly must have been the special object of study of the Lauhitya family. See Kṛṣṇadatta, Kṛṣṇarāta, Jayaka, Triveda Kṛṣṇarāta, Dakṣa Jayanta, Palligupta, Mitrabhūti, Yaśasvin Jayanta, Vipaścit Dṛḍhajayanta, Vaipaścita Dārḍhajayanti, Vaipaścita Dārḍhajayanti Dṛḍhajayanta, Śyāmajayanta, Śyāmasujayanta, Satyaśravas. A Lauhitya or Lauhikya is also mentioned as a teacher in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka. 1) vii. 22; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 50, n. 1. The form of name (Jayanta) affected by the family, and the silence of the older texts, proves that they were modern. V.

Cf. Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 200; Magadha-Vaṅga-Matsyāḥ occurs in the Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭas (i. 7, 7). but that is very late. and which suggests amendment to Vaṅga-Magadhāḥ, ‘the Vaṅgas and the Magadhas,’ two neighbouring peoples.

वत्स-नपात् बाभ्रव<BR> (‘descendant of Babhru’) is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Pathin Saubhara, in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 (Mādhyaṃdina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Kāṇva).

vatsapriibhaalandana|वत्सप्रीभालन्दन
वत्स-प्री भालन्दन<BR> (‘descendant of Bhalandana’) is the name of a sage who ‘saw’ the Vātsapra Sāman (chant). He is mentioned in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 1, 6; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xix. 12 (Indische Studien, 3, 470); Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 2. and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 2) xii. 11, 25. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 7, 4, 1.

vadhaka|वधक
वधक<BR> is the name of some sort of ‘reed’ in the Atharvaveda 1) viii. 8, 3. and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 2) v. 4, 5, 14. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

vadhar|वधर्
वधर्<BR> means a ‘weapon’ generally; it is used not merely of a divine, 1) i. 32, 9, etc. but also of a human 2) Rv. iv. 22, 9; viii. 22, 8; 24, 27. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 221. weapon in the Rigveda.

vadhuu|वधू
1. Vadhū is a frequent word for ‘woman’ in the Rigveda 1) v. 37, 3; 47, 6; vii. 69, 3; viii. 26, 13; x. 27, 12; 85, 30; 107, 9. and later. 2) Av. i. 14, 2; iv. 20, 3; x. 1, 1; xiv. 2, 9, 41, etc. It denotes, according to Delbrück, 3) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 414, 439. the woman as either married or as seeking a husband, or as a bride in the wedding ceremony. The word appears to be derived from a form of the root vah, ‘to carry,’ as is vahatu, ‘the bridal procession,’ thus meaning ‘she who is to be or has been conducted home.’ Zimmer, 4) Altindsiches Leben, 108. however, objects to this explanation, regarding vadhū as a derivative from a different root meaning ‘to marry.’

vadhuu|वधू
2. Vadhū is in one passage of the Rigveda 1) viii. 19, 36. Cf. also v. 47, 6, as taken by Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 319. taken by Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3. to denote a ‘female animal,’ while Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 108, 109. urges that it means a ‘female slave.’ As far as the use of Vadhū goes, either meaning is abnormal, for if Vadhū never elsewhere means a female animal (from vah, to ‘draw’ a cart), neither does it denote a slave: as the passage refers to a gift of fifty Vadhūs by Trasadasyu Paurukutsya to the singer, the latter must have been a polygamist of an advanced type to require fifty wives. The same doubt arises in the case of vadhūmant, which is used in the Rigveda and Atharvaveda as an epithet of the chariot (Ratha), 4) i. 126, 3; vii. 18, 22. of horses (Aśva), 5) viii. 68, 17. Cf. vi. 27, 8. and of buffaloes (Uṣṭra). 6) Av. xx. 127, 2. Zimmer sees in all cases a reference to slaves in the chariots or with the horses: this interpretation has the support of the Bṛhaddevatā. 7) iii. 147 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. Roth's version of the references to horses or buffaloes as ‘suitable for draught’ is not very happy; if vadhū is really a female animal vadhūmant means rather ‘together with mares,’ or ‘together with female buffaloes,’ which makes reasonable sense. 8) Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 197; Pischel, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 35, 712 et seq.; Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v.

vadhrimatii|वध्रिमती
वध्रिमती,<BR> ‘having an impotent man as a husband,’ seems in the Rigveda 1) i. 116, 13; 117, 24; vi. 62, 7; x. 39, 7; 65, 12. to be the name of a woman who owed the restoration of her husband's virility to the Aśvins, and obtained a son, Hiraṇyahasta. The word is, however, possibly only descriptive.

vadhryashva|वध्र्यश्व
1. Vadhry-aśva, ‘having castrated horses,’ is the name in the Rigveda 1) vi. 61, 1; x. 69, 1 et seq. Sumitra, in the latter hymn, can hardly be a name of his. of a prince, the father of Divodāsa, and an energetic supporter of the fire cult, as was his son after him. He is mentioned in a long list of names in the Atharvaveda. 2) iv. 29, 4. Cf. Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, xxiv. 6, 6. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie. 1, 97.

vadhryashvaaanuupa|वध्र्यश्वआनूप
2. Vadhry-aśva Ānūpa (‘descendant of Anūpa’) is the name of the seer of a Sāman, or chant, in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 3, 17). 

vana|वन
वन<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 54, 1; 65, 8; iii. 51, 5; v. 41, 11, etc. and later 2) Kauśika Sūtra, lxxvi. 3, etc. denotes the ‘forest,’ not necessarily of trees only, but, like Araṇya, the wild uninhabited land. 3) Rv. vii. 1, 19 (opposed to dama, ‘home’). It also means ‘wooden cup’ used in the Soma ritual, 4) Rv. i. 55, 4; ii. 14, 9, etc. See Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 163, 166, 193. and in one passage perhaps a part of the chariot. 5) viii. 34, 18.

vanargu|वनर्गु
वनर्-गु,<BR> ‘forest-goer,’ is used in the Rigveda 1) x. 4, 6. and the Atharvaveda 2) iv. 36, 7. to designate robbers who haunt the forests. In the Sāmaveda 3) Āraṇya Saṃhitā, iv. 9. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. the term is more generally opposed to civilized men (kavayaḥ, ‘sages’; vanargavaḥ, ‘savages’).

vanaspati|वनस्पति
वनस्-पति,<BR> ‘lord of the forest,’ primarily denotes ‘tree,’ 1) Rv. i. 166, 5; iii. 34, 10; v. 7, 4; 41, 8, etc.; Av. xi. 6, 1 (distinguished from Vīrudh and Oradhi); 9, 24, etc. and then ‘post’ or ‘pole.’ 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 8, 4; Av. ix. 3, 11, etc. In some passages it is applied either to a part of the chariot or to the chariot as a whole. 3) Rv. ii. 37, 3; iii. 53, 20; vi. 47, 26; Nirukta, ix. 11. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 251. It also means a ‘wooden drum’ 4) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ix. 12. Cf. Av. xii. 3, 15. and a ‘wooden amulet,’ 5) Av. vi. 85, 1; x. 3, 8. 11. while in some passages 6) Rv. i. 91, 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 23, etc. it denotes the plant par excellence, Soma.

vandhura|वन्धुर
वन्धुर<BR> denotes in the Rigveda 1) i. 139, 4; iii. 14, 3; vi. 47, 9, etc. and later 2) Av. x. 4, 2. The Aśvins' car is trivandhura, ‘having three seats,’ because the Aśvins are a pair, and the charioteer makes a third. Cf. Rv. i. 47, 2; 118, 1. 2; 157, 3; 183, 1; vii. 69, 2; 71. 4; viii. 22, 5; and cf. ix. 62, 17.

1. Vamra, 1) Rv. i. 51, 9; viii. 102, 21.

vamraka|वम्रक
वम्रक<BR> is mentioned in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 99, 12. where Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. thinks that an ‘ant’ is meant. But Pischel, 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 238, 239. with more probability, thinks that it is a proper name, perhaps equivalent to Vamra, and denoting the child of a maiden who was saved from being devoured by ants. 4) Rv. iv. 19, 9; 30, 16.

vayas|वयस्
1. Vayas is a common name for ‘bird’ in the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 21, 2; vi. 59, 1; vii. 96, 1; viii. 7, 24, etc. and later. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 1, 1; v. 2, 5, 1; 5, 3, 2. etc.

वय्य<BR> occurs in several passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 54, 6; 112, 6 (where Turvīti does not occur); ii. 13, 12; iv. 19, 6. in connexion with Turvīti, of whom the word is, according to Sāyaṇa, 2) On Rv. i. 54, 6. a patronymic in one passage. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., quoting ix. 68, 8, as a clear case. is inclined to think that the sense of ‘companion’ would suit all passages.

vara|वर
वर<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 83, 2; v. 60, 4; ix. 101, 14; x. 85, 8. 9. and later 2) Av. ii. 36, 1. 5. 6; xi. 8, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 7, 1, etc. regularly denotes a ‘wooer.’

varaNa|वरण
वरण<BR> is the name of a tree (Crataeva Roxburghii) in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 85, 1; x. 3, 1, etc.; xix. 32, 9. and the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 9. 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 8, 4, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 60, 61; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 505.

varaNaavatii|वरणावती
वरणावती<BR> is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 7, 1. It seems to be, as Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. thought, the name of a stream, and is regarded by Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 201. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 20. as the Ganges. Bloomfield, 4) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 376. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 26, 27; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 154. while considering that a plant may, as Sāyaṇa thinks, be meant, yet regards a reference to a river as probable. Cf. Kāśi.

varatraa|वरत्रा
वरत्रा<BR> in the Rigveda 1) iv. 57, 4 (of the plough), etc. and later 2) Av. xi. 3, 10; xx. 135, 13. denotes a ‘thong’ or ‘strap.’ It was used to fasten the oxen to the yoke, 3) Rv. x. 60, 8; 102, 8; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 13. or perhaps to fasten the yoke to the pole. 4) This suits x. 60, 8, rather more naturally, and is so taken by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 248, 249. Or, again, it denotes 5) Rv. x. 106, 5; Zimmer, op. cit., 156. the strap which was used in drawing up water from the well (Avata). 

varashikha|वरशिख
वरशिख<BR> is the name of a leader whose tribe is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) vi. 27, 4. 5. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 156; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 133, who thinks that Varaśikha was the leader of the Turvaśa-Vṛcīvants, but this is conjectural, and not very probable. Cf. Pārthava. In the Bṛhaddevatā, v. 124 et seq., the form of the name is Vāraśikha (‘descendant of Varaśikha’), occurring in the plural only. as being defeated by Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna

varaaha|वराह
वराह,<BR> ‘boar,’ is found in the Rigveda 1) i. 61, 7; viii. 77, 10; ix. 97, 7; x. 28, 4 (cf. Kroṣṭṛ), etc. and later. 2) Av. viii. 7, 23; xii. 1, 48; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, viii. 2; xxv. 2, etc.; Maitrāyaṇi Saṃhitā, iii. 14. 19, etc. The god Rudra is described as the ‘boar of heaven.’ 3) Rv. i. 114, 5. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 4, 2; vii. 1, 5, 1. etc. The use of dogs to hunt the boar is once alluded to. 4) Rv. x. 86, 4, an obscure passage. The variant form of the word, Varāhu, is not used except metaphorically of divinities. 5) Rv. i. 88, 5; 121, 11; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, i. 9, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 81, 82; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 67, who points out that, even in the Rigveda, its use is predominantly metraphorical, x. 28, 4, and x. 86, 4, being the only clear instances of the real sense, and of these x. 86, 4, is doubtful. See also Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 66 et seq.

varu|वरु
वरु<BR> is held by Sāyaṇa to be a proper name in several passages of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 23, 28; 24, 28; 26, 2. where it is accented as a vocative followed by suṣāmṇe. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 39, 84, 85. considers that the name must be Varosuṣāman, despite its doubtful formation.

varuNagRhiita|वरुणगृहीत
वरुण-गृहीत,<BR> ‘seized by Varuṇa,’ is found in several passages 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 2, 1; vi. 4, 2, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 4, 5, 11; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 4, 1, etc. as a description of a man afflicted with dropsy, which is the disease sent by Varuṇa as a punishment for sin. 2) Rv. vi. 74, 4; vii. 88. 7; Av. ii. 10, 1; iv. 16, 6. 7; xiv. 1, 57; 2, 49, etc. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 203; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 29, n. 16. 

varchin|वर्चिन्
वर्चिन्<BR> is the name of a foe of Indra in the Rigveda. 1) ii. 14, 6; iv. 30, 14. 15; vi. 47, 21; vii. 99, 5. Being called a Dāsa, 2) Rv. iv. 30, 15; vi. 47, 21. and coupled with Śambara, he is probably to be regarded as a terrestrial foe, though he is also spoken of as an Asura. 3) Rv. vii. 99, 5. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 152; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 103, n. 3; 3, 273; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 162 (F). He may possibly have been connected with the Vṛcīvants.

varNa|वर्ण
1. Varṇa, ‘colour,’ is a common word in the Rigveda 1) i. 73, 7; 96, 5; 113, 2; iv. 5. 13; ix. 97, 15; 104, 4; 105, 1; x. 3, 3, etc. and later. 2) Av. i. 22, 1. 2; 23, 2; xi. 8, 16; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 26, etc. A large number of colours are enumerated in Vedic literature, but it is not possible to deduce any clear information as to the accuracy with which the Vedic Indian distinguished colours, or as to the principle on which his distinctions were based. The Rigveda seems to show that red or yellow colours were the most noticed, but this may be accidental. 3) Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, cxxi et seq. ‘Black’ or ‘dark’ is denoted by kṛṣṇa, ‘white’ or ‘light-coloured’ by śukla or śveta. ‘Black’ seems to be meant in one passage of the Rigveda 4) i. 140, 9. Cf. Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 8; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 250, 251. by śyenī also. ‘Dark-grey’ or ‘dusky’ is expressed by śyāma. 5) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 3, 7. The sense of nīla 6) The nīla of the Chāndogya Upaniśad iii. 6, 1, is replaced by kṛṣṇa in the Kausītaki Upaniṣad iv. to Cf. Rv. viii. 19, 31. In the post-Vedic language nīla describes the colour of dark blue objects, such as indigo, sapphire, etc. That the word already had some such sense in the Rigveda is suggested by its use in allusions to the smoke of Agni. is doubtful, perhaps ‘dark-blue,’ ‘bluish-black.’ The series of words hari, hariṇa, harit, harita, seems, on the whole, to denote ‘yellow,’ but ‘green’ is also a possible rendering, since the epithet is used of the frog. 7) Rv. vii. 103, 6, and cf. iii. 44, 3; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 365, n. ‘Brown’ is certainly the meaning of babhru, which is used of the Vibhītaka nut (see Akṣa). ‘Reddish-brown’ seems to be the tinge implied by kapila 8) Rv. x. 27, 16; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 14. (‘monkey-coloured’), while piṅgala appears to denote a shade of brown in which yellow pre dominates, ‘tawny.’ 9) Av. xi. 5, 26; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 6, 2; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 14. ‘Yellow’ is expressed by pīta as well as pāṇḍu. 10) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 3, 6. A garment of saffron (māhārajana) is mentioned in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 11) Loc. cit. Rudhira and lohita are red, while aruṇa is ‘ruddy.’ Kalmāṣa means ‘spotted,’ 12) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxix. 58. and śilpa ‘dappled,’ 13) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 5; xxix. 58; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 22, 1; 6, 13, 1; 20, 1. while mingled shades like aruṇa-piśaṅga, ‘reddish brown,’ also occur. 14) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 6, 11, 6. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 119 et seq.

varNa|वर्ण
2. Varṇa (lit. ‘colour’) in the Rigveda 1) Dāsa, Rv. ii. 12, 4; ārya varṇa as against dasyu, iii. 34, 9; varṇa itself opposed to dāsa, i. 104, 2. Cf. ii. 3, 5. Cf. a verse in Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 25, 2; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 14. Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 113, reads varṇaśeṣas in Rv. v. 65, 5. is applied to denote classes of men, the Dāsa and the Āryan Varṇa being contrasted, as other passages 2) See Dasyu, Dāsa; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 113, 114. There is no trace in Vedic literature of any real distinction of colour save this main one. In the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 23, the Brahman's colour is white (śukla); the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 6, calls the Vaiśya ‘white’ (śukla), the Rājanya ‘swarthy’ (dhūmra); and the later view makes the four castes black, yellow (pīta), red (rakta), and white respectively. See Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 10, 11; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 153, etc., 176. Cf. also Av. iii. 4, 6, where Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 90, with hesitation suggests the reading varṇaiḥ, ‘castes.’ show, on account of colour. But this use is confined to distinguishing two colours: in this respect the Rigveda differs fundamentally from the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas, 3) Catvāro varṇāḥ, ‘four castes,’ Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 4, 9; vi. 4, 4, 13; śaudra varṇa, ‘Śūdra caste,’ ibid., vi. 4, 4, 9; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 2, 25; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 4.

See Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 22, n. 4; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 53. where the four castes (varṇāḥ) are already fully recognized. (a) Caste in the Rigveda.--The use of the term Varṇa is not, of course, conclusive for the question whether caste existed in the Rigveda. In one sense it must be admitted to have existed: the Puruṣa-sūkta, ‘hymn of man,’ in the tenth Maṇḍala 4) Rv. x. 90, 12 = Av. xix. 6, 6 = Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxi. 11 = Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iii. 12, 5. Cf. Muir, 12, 7-15, and references. clearly contemplates the division of mankind into four classes--the Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra. But the hymn being admittedly late, 5) Max Müller, Sanskrit Literature, 570 et seq.; Muir, loc. cit.; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 3 et seq.; Colebrooke, Essays, 1, 309; Arnold, Vedic Metre, p. 167. its evidence is not cogent for the bulk of the Rigveda. Zimmer 6) Altindisches Leben, 185-203. has with great force combatted the view that the Rigveda was produced in a society that knew the caste system. He points out that the Brāhmaṇas 7) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 1. Cf. Av. xv., and see Vrātya. show us the Vedic Indians on the Indus as unbrahminized, and not under the caste system; he argues that the Rigveda was the product of tribes living in the Indus region and the Panjab; later on a part of this people, who had wandered farther east, developed the peculiar civilization of the caste system. He adopts the arguments of Muir, 8) Sanskrit Texts, 12, 239 et seq., especially 258. derived from the study of the data of the Rigveda, viz.: that (a) the four castes appear only in the late Puruṣasūkta; (b) the term Varṇa, as shown above, covers the three highest castes of later times, and is only contrasted with Dāsa; (c) that Brāhmaṇa is rare in the Rigveda, Kṣatriya occurs seldom, 9) Rv. viii. 104, 13; x. 109, 3, and cf. Kṣatriya. Rājanya only in the Puruṣasūkta, where too, alone, Vaiśya and Śūdra are found; (d) that Brahman denotes at first ‘poet,’ ‘sage,’ and then ‘officiating priest,’ or still later a special class of priest; (e) that in some only of the passages 10) Rv. i. 108, 7; iv. 50, 8 et seq.; viii. 7, 20; 45, 39; 53, 7; 81, 30; ix. 112, 1; x. 85, 29. where it occurs does Brahman denote a ‘priest by profession,’ while in others it denotes something peculiar to the individual, designating a person distinguished for genius or virtue, or specially chosen to receive divine inspiration. 11) Rv. x. 107, 6; 125, 5. Brāhmaṇa, on the other hand, as Muir admits, 12) Op. cit., 2, 259. already denotes a hereditary professional priesthood. Zimmer connects the change from the casteless system of the Rigveda to the elaborate system of the Yajurveda with the advance of the Vedic Indians to the east, comparing the Germanic invasions that transformed the German tribes into monarchies closely allied with the church. The needs of a conquering people evoke the monarch; the lesser princes sink to the position of nobles; for repelling the attacks of aborigines or of other Āryan tribes, and for quelling the revolts of the subdued population, the state requires a standing army in the shape of the armed retainers of the king, and beside the nobility of the lesser princes arises that of the king's chief retainers, as the Thegns supplemented the Gesiths of the Anglo-Saxon monarchies. 13) Maitland, Domesday Book, 164 et seq. At the same time the people ceased to take part in military matters, and under climatic influences left the conduct of war to the nobility and their retainers, devoting themselves to agriculture, pastoral pursuits, and trade. But the advantage won by the nobles over the people was shared by them with the priesthood, the origin of whose power lies in the Purohitaship, as Roth first saw. 14) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 117 et seq. Originally the prince could sacrifice for himself and the people, but the Rigveda 15) Rv. iii. 33, 8; vii. 18; 83. itself shows cases, like those of Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha illustrating forcibly the power of the Purohita, though at the same time the right of the noble to act as Purohita is seen in the case of Devāpi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa. 16) Yāska, Nirukta, ii. 10, explaining Rv. x. 98. The Brahmins saw their opportunity, through the Purohitaship, of gaining practical power during the confusion and difficulties of the wars of invasion, and secured it, though only after many struggles, the traces of which are seen in the Epic tradition. 17) Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 705 et seq.; Muir, op. cit., 2^2, 296479. The Atharvaveda 18) v. 17-19; Muir, 22, 280-289. also preserves relics of these conflicts in its narration of the ruin of the Sṛñjayas because of oppressing Brahmins, and besides other hymns of the Atharvaveda (viiixii), the Śatarudriya litany of the Yajurveda 19) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi = Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 1-11 = Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 11-16 = Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9. 1-10. reflects the period of storm and stress when the aboriginal population was still seething with discontent, and Rudra was worshipped as the patron god of all sorts of evil doers. 20) Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 22 et seq.; Indian Literature, 110, 111. This version of the development of caste has received a good deal of acceptance in its main outlines, and it may almost be regarded as the recognized version. 21) See, e.g., von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 152 et seq.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 159 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 1 et seq.; Kaegi, Rigveda, n. 58. It has, however, always been opposed by some scholars, such as Haug, 22) Brahma und die Brahmanen, 1871. Kern, 23) Indische Theorien over de Standenverdeeling, 1871. Cf. for this, and the preceding work, Muir, op. cit., 22, 454 et seq. Ludwig, 24) Die Nachrichten des Rig und Atharvaveda über Geographie, Geschichte und Verfassung des alten Indien, 36 et seq.; Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 237-243, etc. and more recently by Oldenberg 25) Religion des Veda, 373 et seq., and cf. Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 51, 267 et seq. and by Geldner. 26) Vedische Studien, 2, 146, n. The matter may be to some extent simplified by recognizing at once that the caste system is one that has progressively developed, and that it is not legitimate to see in the Rigveda the full caste system even of the Yajurveda; but at the same time it is difficult to doubt that the system was already well on its way to general acceptance. The argument from the nonbrahminical character of the Vrātyas of the Indus and Panjab loses its force when it is remembered that there is much evidence in favour of placing the composition of the bulk of the Rigveda, especially the books 27) iii. and vii. in which Sudās appears with Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, in the east, the later Madhyadeśa, a view supported by Pischel, 28) Vedische Studien, 2, 218. Geldner, 29) Ibid., 3, 152. Hopkins, 30) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 18. and Macdonell. 31) Sanskrit Literature, 145. Nor is it possible to maintain that Brahman in the Rigveda merely means a ‘poet’ or ‘sage.’ It is admitted by Muir that in some passages it must mean a hereditary profession; in fact, there is not a single passage in which it occurs where the sense of ‘priest’ is not allowable, since the priest was of course the singer. Moreover, there are traces in the Rigveda of the threefold 32) Rv. viii. 35, 16-18. or fourfold 33) Rv. i. 113, 6. More doubtful are the references seen by Ludwig to the three castes in ii. 27, 8; vi. 51, 2; vii. 66, 10. division of the people into brahma, kṣatram, and viśaḥ, or into the three classes and the servile population. Nor even in respect to the later period, any more than to the Rigveda, is the view correct that regards the Vaiśyas as not taking part in war. The Rigveda evidently 34) See Ludwig, op. cit., 3, 231 et seq., Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 94, 95, and see Viś, Vaiśya. knows of no restriction of war to a nobility and its retainers, but the late Atharvaveda 35) iii. 19, 1; ix. 7, 9; xv. 9, 2. 3. equally classes the folk with the bala, ‘power,’ representing the Viś as associated with the Sabhā, Samiti, and Senā, the assemblies of the people and the armed host. Zimmer 36) Op. cit., 194. explains these references as due to tradition only; but this is hardly a legitimate argument, resting, as it does, on the false assumption that only a Kṣatriya can fight. But it is (see Kṣatriya) very doubtful whether Kṣatriya means anything more than a member of the nobility, though later, in the Epic, it included the retainers of the nobility, who increased in numbers with the growth of military monarchies, and though later the ordinary people did not necessarily take part in wars, an abstention that is, however, much exaggerated if it is treated as an absolute one. The Kṣatriyas were no doubt a hereditary body; monarchy was already hereditary (see Rājan), and it is admitted that the Śūdras were a separate body: thus all the elements of the caste system were already in existence. The Purohita, indeed, was a person of great importance, but it is clear, as Oldenberg 37) Religion des Veda, 382, 383. urges, that he was not the creator of the power of the priesthood, but owed his position, and the influence he could in consequence exert, to the fact that the sacrifice required for its proper performance the aid of a hereditary priest in whose possession was the traditional sacred knowledge. Nor can any argument for the non-existence of the caste system be derived from cases like that of Devāpi. For, in the first place, the Upaniṣads show kings in the exercise of the priestly functions of learning and teaching, and the Upaniṣads are certainly contemporaneous with an elaborated caste system. In the second place the Rigvedic evidence is very weak, for Devāpi, who certainly acts as Purohita, is not stated in the Rigveda to be a prince at all, though Yāska 38) ii. 10. calls him a Kauravya; the hymns attributed to kings and others cannot be vindicated for them by certain evidence, though here, again, the Brāhmaṇas do not scruple to recognize Rājanyarṣis, or ‘royal sages’; and the famous Viśvāmitra shows in the Rigveda no sign of the royal character which the Brāhmaṇas insist on fastening on him in the shape of royal descent in the line of Jahnu. 39) See Viśvāmitra and Jahnu. (b) Caste in the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas.--The relation between the later and the earlier periods of the Vedic history of caste must probably be regarded in the main as the hardening of a system already formed by the time of the Rigveda. 1. The Names of the Castes.--The most regular names are Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra, 40) Rv. x. 90; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 1, 4. 5; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 19, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 4, 12; iii. 1, 1, 10; v. 5, 4, 9; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1, 6-11. or later Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra. 41) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 2, 27 (Mādhyaṃdina = i. 4, 15 Kāṇva); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 4, 4, 13; xiii. 6, 2, 10; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 5. There are many other variants: Brahman, Kṣatra, Śūdrāryau; 42) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 10, 1-3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 28-30.

In other cases the fourth class is represented by a special member: Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, and Cāṇḍāla. 48) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 10, 7. Often only the three upper classes are mentioned, as Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya; 49) Av. v. 17, 9; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 5; 2, 2; iv. 4, 9 (with Vaiśya before Rājanya); Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 12, 9, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 5, 2. 3; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 8, 8.

Three castes--Brāhmaṇa, Rājan, Śūdra--are mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 52) x. 1, 13. and two castes are repeatedly mentioned together, either Brahman and Kṣatra, or Kṣatra and Viś. 53) See Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, Viś. 2. The Relation of the Castes.--The ritual literature is full of minute differences respecting the castes. Thus, for example, the Śatapatha prescribes different sizes of funeral mounds for the four castes, 54) xiii. 8, 3, 11. Different modes of address are laid down for the four castes, 55) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 4, 12. as ehi, ‘approach’; āgaccha, ‘come’; ādrava, ‘run up’; ādhāva, ‘hasten up,’ which differ in degrees of politeness. The representatives of the four castes are dedicated at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) to different deities. 56) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 5; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 1, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 6, 2, 10. For other similar differences in the Brāhmaṇas, see Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 10, 1. 2; vii. 1, 1, 4. 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 4; xxxvii. 1; xxxix. 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 10; xiv. 24; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 23. 24; viii. 4, etc. The Sūtras have many similar rules. 57) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 24, 11. 12, and see Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 20 et seq. But the three upper castes in some respects differ markedly from the fourth, the Śūdras. The latter are in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 58) iii. 1, 1, 10. Cf. Āpastamba, cited in scholia on Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, vii. 5, 7; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 8, 7; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 12 et seq. Generally Śūdras are impure, and cannot be allowed at the place of sacrifice (deva-yajana), Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 1, 9. Cf. v. 3, 3, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 1, 6; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 10 (Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 8, does not contain this notice). declared not fit to be addressed by a Dīkṣita, ‘consecrated person,’ and no Śūdra is to milk the cow whose milk is to be used for the Agnihotra 59) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxi. 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 3. (‘fire-oblation’). On the other hand, in certain passages, the Śūdra is given a place in the Soma sacrifice, 60) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 4, 9. Cf. also ibid., i. 1, 4, 12. The scholiast on Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 1, 6, refers these notices to the Rathakāra alone, but this is obviously secondary. and in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 61) i. 1, 4, 8. there are given formulæ for the placing of the sacrificial fire not only for the three upper castes, but also for the Rathakāra, ‘chariot-maker.’ Again, in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 62) vii. 19, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 4, 6; Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 6; Lévi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 81. the Brāhmaṇa is opposed as ‘eater of the oblation’ to the members of the other three castes. The characteristics of the several castes are given under Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya and Rājan, Vaiśya, Śūdra: they may be briefly summed up as follows: The Viś forms the basis of the state on which the Brahman and Kṣatra rest; 63) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 2, 7, 16; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 4. the Brahman and Kṣatra are superior to the Viś; 64) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ii. 8, 2; xi. 11, 9; xv. 6, 3; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 33, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxix. 10;  Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 10, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 4, 4, 13, etc. while all three classes are superior to the Śūdras. The real power of the state rested with the king and his nobles, with their retainers, who may be deemed the Kṣatriya element. Engaged in the business of the protection of the country, its administration, the decision of legal cases, and in war, the nobles subsisted, no doubt, on the revenues in kind levied from the people, the king granting to them villages (see Grāma) for their maintenance, while some of them, no doubt, had lands of their own cultivated for them by slaves or by tenants. The states were seemingly small: 65) Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 32, for the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the later parts of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, with their traditions of Aśvamedhas, ‘horse sacrifices,’ and their recollections of the glories of the Bharatas, represent a more advanced stage of social relations and of city life, but even they hardly know really great kingdoms. there are no clear signs of any really large kingdoms, despite the mention of Mahārājas. The people, engaged in agriculture, pastoral pursuits, and trade (Vaṇij), paid tribute to the king and nobles for the protection afforded them. That, as BadenPowell suggests, 66) Indian Village Community and Village Communities in India, where much stress is laid on the idea of a settlement of Āryans on lands already occupied by Dravidian clans, much as Anglo-Saxon invaders on one theory occupied lands already held by Britons who became serfs, while the invaders were a landholding aristocracy, a theory supported by the fact that the normal holding of a hide is estimated at 120 acres. they were not themselves agriculturists is probably erroneous; some might be landowners on a large scale, and draw their revenues from Śūdra tenants, or even Āryan tenants, but that the people as a whole were in this position is extremely unlikely. 67) Cf. Hopkins, India, Old and New, 222. The point is much the same as that at issue between the different schools of opinion as to early English history. Did the Āryans in India occupy the land as a people, driving out or exterminating or enslaving the Dāsas, and themselves carrying on the occupations of a people, or did they merely form a small aristocracy of superior military force, and were the Kṣatriyas the true Āryans? The evidence of the Rigveda is really fatal to the latter alternative hypothesis. In war the people shared the conflicts of the nobles, for there was not yet any absolute separation of the functions of the several classes. The priests may be divided into two classes--the Purohitas of the kings, who guided their employers by their counsel, and were in a position to acquire great influence in the state, as it is evident they actually did, and the ordinary priests who led quiet lives, except when they were engaged on some great festival of a king or a wealthy noble. 68) For the superiority of the Brāhmaṇa to the Kṣatriya or Rājanya, see Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xi. 11, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 21; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 1, 12; 4, 4, 15; xiii. 1, 9, 1; 3, 7, 8; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 15, 8; viii. 9, 6; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 20, 12. The Brāhmaṇa is, in his turn, dependent on the king (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 3, 3; v. 4, 2, 7), and at the Rājasūya sits beside him, but is none the less superior (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 2, 23). The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxviii. 5, says the Kṣatra is over the Brahman, but this is not a usual view. Cf. xxvii. 4. A Brāhmaṇa can get along without a Kṣatriya, but not vice versa (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 4, 6), and a Rājanya with a Brāhmaṇa surpasses all other Rājanyas (Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 10, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xix. 10; xxvii. 4, etc.). The relations and functions of the castes are well summed up in a passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 69) vii. 29. See Muir, op. cit., 1^2, 436 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 14. which treats of them as opposed to the Kṣatriya. The Brāhmaṇa is a receiver of gifts (ā-dāyī), a drinker of Soma (ā-pāyī), a seeker of food (āvasāyī), 70) Weber, op. cit., 9, 326; 10, 14, prefers ‘moving’ or ‘dwelling’ everywhere. and liable to removal at will (yathākāma-prayāpyaḥ). 71) Muir, Haug, and Weber take the word as active in sense, ‘moving at will.’ But both the parallelism of the passage and the formation of the word require a passive causative sense. The reference is perhaps to the general political control of the king over the priest, whom he can ‘move on’ from place to place. The Vaiśya is tributary to another (anyasya balikṛt), to be lived on by another (anyasyādyaḥ), and to be oppressed at will (yathākāma-jyeyaḥ). 72) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 29, 3. The Śūdra is the servant of another (anyasya preṣyaḥ), to be expelled at will (kāmotthāpyaḥ), and to be slain at pleasure (yathākāma-vadhyaḥ). 73) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 29, 4. The descriptions seem calculated to show the relation of each of the castes to the Rājanya. Even the Brāhmaṇa he can control, whilst the Vaiśya is his inferior and tributary, whom he can remove without cause from his land, 74) This seems to be the most probable reference of yathākāmajyeyaḥ. The expulsion of the Vaiśya is here not in allusion to quasi-ownership of land by the King or Kṣatriya; it is an act of royal authority, not an incident of tenure. See Keith, Journal of the African Society, 6, 202 et seq., and cf. Hopkins, India, Old and New, 222, 223. but who is still free, and whom he cannot maim or slay without due process. The Śūdra has no rights of property or life against the noble, especially the king. The passage is a late one, and the high place of the Kṣatriya is to some extent accounted for by this fact. It is clear that in the course of time the Vaiśya fell more and more in position with the hardening of the divisions of caste. Weber 75) Ueber den Vājapeya, 10 et seq. shows reason for believing that the Vājapeya sacrifice, a festival of which a chariot race forms an integral part, 76) Ibid. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 247; Festgruss an Böhtlingk, 40 et seq.; Rituallitteratur, 141. was, as the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 77) xvi. 17, 4. Cf. xv. 1, 1. says, once a sacrifice for a Vaiśya, as well as for a priest or king. But the king, too, had to suffer diminution of his influence at the hands of the priest: the Taittirīya texts 78) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 2, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 6, 1. Cf. Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 11, 1; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ix. 9, 19; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41. xxiv. xxv. show that the Vājapeya was originally a lesser sacrifice which, in the case of a king, was followed by the Rājasūya, or consecration of him as an overlord of lesser kings, and in that of the Brahmin by the Bṛhaspatisava, a festival celebrated on his appointment as a royal Purohita. But the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 79) v. 1, 1, 1 et seq.; 2, 1, 19; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 1, 1-2. Weber, op. cit., 8, 9, interprets the situation differently from Eggeling. exalts the Vājapeya, in which a priest could be the sacrificer, over the Rājasūya, from which he was excluded, and identifies it with the Bṛhaspatisava, a clear piece of juggling in the interests of the priestly pretentions. But we must not overestimate the value of such passages, or the exaltation of the Purohita in the later books of the Śatapatha and Aitareya Brāhmaṇas as evidence of a real growth in the priestly power: these books represent the views of the priests of what their own powers should be, and to some extent were in the Madhyadeśa. Another side of the picture is presented in the Pāli literature, 80) Fick, Dic sociale Gliederung, 107 et seq.; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 53 et seq.; 158. which, belonging to a later period than the Vedic, undoubtedly underestimates the position of the priests; while the Epic, 81) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 984 et seq. more nearly contemporaneous with the later Vedic period, displays, despite all priestly redaction, the temporal superiority of the nobility in clear light. Although clear distinctions were made between the different castes, there is little trace in Vedic literature of one of the leading characteristics of the later system, the impurity communicated by the touch or contact of the inferior castes, 82) See, e.g. Manu, iii. 239; v. 85; Fick, op. cit., 26 et seq. which is seen both directly in the purification rendered necessary in case of contact with a Śūdra, and indirectly in the prohibition of eating in company with men of lower caste. 83) Vāsiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, xiv. 1 et seq.; Gautama Dharma Sūtra, xvii. 17; Āpastamba Dharma Sūtra, i. 6, 18, 16 et seq.; ii. 4, 9, 7, with Bühler's note; Manu, iv. 210 et seq.; Viṣṇu, 41, 7 et seq.; Fick, op. cit., 30-33, who points out that the Jātakas cohtain little evidence on the practice. Senart, Les Castes dans l'Inde, 48 et seq., 212 et seq., attributes great importance to the question of eating together, and compares the sacrificial meals of the gens at Rome, where strangers were excluded (Fustel de Coulanges, La Cité Antique, 117). But this is not conclusive; a caste is not a gens, and the gens excluded strangers only at a solemn festival, when the whole gens renewed its blood kinship. If we have no evidence exactly establishing this for the Gotra in early Vedic literature, we need not nesitate to believe that in the earliest Vedic period the Gotra had solemn festivals of union, and of communication with the dead, but that again does not explain or amount to the caste prohibition of taking food from an inferior. It is true that prohibition of eating in company with others does appear, 84) E.g., Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v. 3, 3. with Keith's note. but not in connexion with caste: its purpose is to preserve the peculiar sanctity of those who perform a certain rite or believe in a certain doctrine; for persons who eat of the same food together, according to primitive thought, acquire the same characteristics and enter into a sacramental communion. But Vedic literature does not yet show that to take food from an inferior caste was forbidden as destroying purity. 85) For a case of objection to eating food after another, see Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 10, 1. Possibly the idea there is that eating the food of a chief is dangerous, since the eater thus enters into possession of part of his substance, and consequently at once becomes an object of anger to the chief, as well as of danger to himself; for the chief may be so full of divine force that it would be unsafe for an ordinary man to be assimilated to him--a common idea in primitive societies. See also Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, v. 8, 13. Nor, of course, has the caste system developed the constitution with a head, a council, and common festivals which the modern caste has; for such an organization is not found even in the Epic or in the Pāli literature. 86) Fick, op. cit., 24. Senart, op. cit., 219, 220, compares the family councils of Greece, Rome, and Germany (Leist, Altarisches Jus Civile, 273 et seq.; Kovalevsky, Famille et Propriété Primitives, 119; Fustel de Coulanges, op. cit., 118, 119). But here again the system may have applied to the Gotra without its really explaining the later appearance of the practice in the caste, and the absence of the mention of a council in the early and late literature alike is conclusive against its existence. The Vedic characteristics of caste are heredity, pursuit of a common occupation, and restriction on intermarriage. 3. Restrictions on Intermarriage.--Arrian, in his Indica, 87) xii. 8. 9. probably on the authority of Megasthenes, makes the prohibition of marriage between , no doubt ‘castes,’ a characteristic of Indian life. The evidence of Pāli literature 88) Fick, op. cit., 34-40. is in favour of this view, though it shows that a king could marry whom he wished, and could make his son by that wife the heir appearent. But it equally shows that there were others who held that not the father's but the mother's rank determined the social standing of the son. Though Manu 89) x. 5; iii. 15. recognizes the possibility of marriage with the next lower caste as producing legitimate children, still he condemns the marriage of an Āryan with a woman of lower caste. The Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra 90) i. 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 21, 74. allows the marriage of a Kṣatriya with a wife of his own caste or of the lower caste, of a Brahmin with a wife of his own caste or of the two lower classes, and of a Vaiśya with a Vaiśya wife only. But it quotes the opinion of others that all of them can marry a Śūdra wife, while other authorities condemn the marriage with a Śūdra wife in certain circumstances, which implies that in other cases it might be justified. 91) Gobhila Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 2, 42. The earlier literature bears out this impression: much stress is laid on descent from a Ṛṣi, and on purity of descent; 92) See Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 6, 1, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vii. 46; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 4, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 3, 4, 19; xii. 4, 4, 6; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxv. 3, 17; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 1, 7; Kauśika Sūtra, 67, etc. So one of the characteristics of a Brāhmaṇa given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 7, 1, is brāhmaṇya, which Weber, op. cit., 10, 69, takes as referring to descent. Brahma-putra is a title of honour, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 4, 1, 2. 9; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ii. 18, 12; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 21, 1. 2; and to be born the son of a wise Brāhmaṇa is the highest fortune, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 29. but there is other evidence for the view that even a Brāhmaṇa need not be of pure lineage. Kavaṣa Ailūṣa is taunted with being the son of a Dāsī, ‘slave woman,’ 93) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 19, 1; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xii. 3. Cf. Weber, op. cit., 2, 311; 9, 42, 44, 46. and Vatsa was accused of being a Śūdrā's son, but established his purity by walking unhurt through the flames of a fire ordeal. 94) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 6. 6. He who is learned (śuśruvān) is said to be a Brāhmaṇa, descended from a Ṛṣi (ārṣeya), in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā; 95) vi. 6, 1, 4. and Satyakāma, son of Jabālā, was accepted as a pupil by Hāridrumata Gautama, though he could not name his father. 96) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 4; Weber, op. cit., 1, 263. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 4, 1. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 97) xxx. 1. Cf. Weber, op. cit., 3, 462. says that knowledge is all-important, not descent. But all this merely goes to show that there was a measure of laxity in the hereditary character of caste, not that it was not based on heredity. The Yajurveda Saṃhitās 98) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 19, 3. 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, Aśvamedha, iv. 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 30. 31. The word Arya here must refer in all probability to any Āryan, not merely to a Vaiśya, Weber, op. cit., 10, 6. recognize the illicit union of Ārya and Śūdrā, and vice versa: it is not unlikely that if illicit unions took place, legal marriage was quite possible. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 99) xiv. 11, 17; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 56, n. But there is no mention here of Uśij being a slave. indeed, recognizes such a case in that of Dīrghatamas, son of the slave girl Uśij, if we may adopt the description of Uśij given in the Bṛhaddevatā. 100) iv. 24. 25. In a hymn of the Atharvaveda 101) v. 17, 8. 9. See Muir, 12, 282, n. 76; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 249. The exact sense is not clear, but the passage is intended to show in the strongest light the high position of the Brāhmaṇa. extreme claims are put forward for the Brāhmaṇa, who alone is a true husband and the real husband, even if the woman has had others, a Rājanya or a Vaiśya: a Śūdra husband is not mentioned, probably on purpose. 102) The sense of v. 17, 18, is obscure; it can be interpreted to mean that the Brāhmaṇa should be provided with a temporary wife on each occasion when he pays a visit (cf. Whitney, 250). But this is hardly likely. Muir takes it as referring to his own wife. The marriage of Brāhmaṇas with Rājanya women is illustrated by the cases of Sukanyā, daughter of king Śaryāta, who married Cyavana, 103) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 5, 7. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 244, 245; Weber, op. cit., 10, 73 et seq.; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 352, 353. and of Rathavīti's daughter, who married Śyāvāśva. 104) Cf. Bṛhaddevatā, v. 50 et seq. 4. Occupation and Caste.--The Greek authorities 105) Arrian, Indica, xii. 8. 9; Strabo, xv. 4, 49. and the evidence of the Jātakas 106) Fick, op. cit., 40 et seq. concur in showing it to have been the general rule that each caste was confined to its own occupations, but that the Brāhmaṇas did engage in many professions beside that of simple priest, while all castes gave members to the Śramaṇas, or homeless ascetics. The Jātakas 107) Rhys Davids, op. cit., 54 et seq. recognize the Brahmins as engaged in all sorts of occupations, as merchants, traders, agriculturists, and so forth. Matters are somewhat simpler in Vedic literature, where the Brāhmaṇas and Kṣatriyas appear as practically confined to their own professions of sacrifice and military or administrative functions. Ludwig 108) Op. cit., 3, 237 et seq. sees in Dīrghaśravas in the Rigveda 109) i. 112, 11. a Brahmin reduced by indigence to acting as a merchant, as allowed even later by the Sūtra literature; but this is not certain, though it is perfectly possible. More interesting is the question how far the Kṣatriyas practised the duties of priests; the evidence here is conflicting. The best known case is, of course, that of Viśvāmitra. In the Rigveda he appears merely as a priest who is attached to the court of Sudās, king of the Tṛtsus; but in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 110) xxi. 12, 2. See Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 54. he is called a king, a descendant of Jahnu, and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 111) vii. 18, 9. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 21, where the reading is different, but worse. But see Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 16. refers to Śunaḥśepa's succeeding, through his adoption by Viśvāmitra, to the divine lore (daiva veda) of the Gāthins and the lordship of the Jahnus. That in fact this tradition is correct seems most improbable, but it serves at least to illustrate the existence of seers of royal origin. Such figures appear more than once in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 112) xii. 12, 6; xviii. 10, 5. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 235, n. 3. which knows the technical terms Rājanyarṣi and Devarājan corresponding to the later Rājarṣi, ‘royal sage.’ The Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa 113) P. 562 of the manuscript, cited by Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 154, n. says of one who knows a certain doctrine, ‘being a king he becomes a seer’ (rājā sann ṛṣir bhavati), and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 114) i. 4, 2. Cf. Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 17, 6, where Viśvāmitra is addressed as Rājaputra. applies the term Rājanya to a Brāhmaṇa. Again, it is argued that Devāpi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa, who acted as Purohita, according to the Rigveda, 115) x. 98. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 196; Senart, Les Castes dans l'Inde, 165; Muir, 12, 269 et seq. for Śantanu, was a prince, as Yāska 116) Nirukta, ii. 10. says or implies he was. 117) It may be added that a family of Ārṣṭiṣeṇas appear as ritual authorities in a scholium on Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 9, 3; Weber, op. cit., 10. 95. But this assumption seems to be only an error of Yāska's. Since nothing in the Rigveda alludes to any relationship, it is impossible to accept Sieg's view 118) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 142. that the Rigveda recognizes the two as brothers, but presents the fact of a prince acting the part of Purohita as unusual and requiring explanation. The principle, however, thus accepted by Sieg as to princes in the Rigveda seems sound enough. Again, Muir 119) Op. cit., 12, 265 et seq. has argued that Hindu tradition, as shown in Sāyaṇa, 120) On Rv. i. 100; iv. 42. 43. 44; v. 27; vi. 15; x. 9. 75. 133. 134. 148. 179, etc. regards many hymns of the Rigveda as composed by royal personages, but he admits that in many cases the ascription is wrong; it may be added that in the case of Pṛthī Vainya, where the hymn 121) x. 148, 5. ascribed to him seems to be his, it is not shown in the hymn itself that he is other than a seer; the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 122) v. 3, 5, 4. calls him a king, but that is probably of no more value than the later tradition as to Viśvāmitra. The case of Viśvantara and the Śyāparṇas mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 123) vii. 27 et seq. has been cited 124) Zimmer, op. cit., 196. as that of a king sacrificing without priestly aid, but the interpretation is quite uncertain, while the parallel of the Kaśyapas, Asitamṛgas, and Bhūtavīras mentioned in the course of the narrative renders it highly probable that the king had other priests to carry out the sacrifice. Somewhat different are a series of other cases found in the Upaniṣads, where the Brahma doctrine is ascribed to royal persons. Thus Janaka is said in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 125) xi. 6, 2, 10; Muir, 12, 426-430. to have become a Brahman; Ajātaśatru taught Gārgya Bālāki; 126) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 1, 1; Kauṣitaki Upaniṣad, iv. 1. Pravāhaṇa Jaivali instructed Śvetaketu Āruṇeya, 127) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 1 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 2, 1 Kāṇva); Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 3, 1. as well as Śilaka Śālāvatya 128) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 8, 1. and Caikitāyana Dālbhya; and Aśvapati Kaikeya taught Brahmins. 129) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 6, 1, 2. It has been deduced 130) Deussen, Allgemcine Geschichte der Philosophie, 1, 2, 354; Philosophy of the Upanishads, 17 et seq.; Garbe, Beiträge zur indischen Kulturgeschichte, 1 et seq.; Philosophy of Ancient India, 73 et seq.; Grierson, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 602 et seq.; Winternitz. Geschichte der indischen Litteratur, 1, 256 et seq. from such passages that the Brahma doctrine was a product of the Kṣatriyas. This conclusion is, however, entirely doubtful, 131) Bloomfield, Religion of the Veda, 218 et seq.; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 838, 868, 1142; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 50, 51, 257; Oldenberg. Buddha,^5 73, n. 1. for kings were naturally willing to be flattered by the ascription to them of philosophic activity, and elsewhere 132) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, viii. 1, 4, 10. the opinion of a Rājanya is treated with contempt. It is probably a fair deduction that the royal caste did not much concern itself with the sacred lore of the priests, though it is not unlikely that individual exceptions occurred. But that warriors became priests, that an actual change of caste took place, is quite unproved by a single genuine example. That it was impossible we cannot say, but it seems not to have taken place. To be distinguished from a caste change, as Fick 133) Op. cit., 44, n. 1. points out, is the fact that a member of any caste could, in the later period at least, become a Śramaṇa, as is recorded in effect of many kings in the Epic. 134) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 179 et seq., who treats this as a change of caste. Whether the practice is Vedic is not clear: Yāska 135) Nirukta, ii. 10. He went to the forest and practised asceticism, which is not necessarily a change of caste. records it of Devāpi, but this is not evidence for times much anterior to the rise of Buddhism. On the other hand, the Brahmins, or at least the Purohitas, accompanied the princes in battle, and probably, like the mediæval clergy, were not unprepared to fight, 136) See Rv. iii. 53, 12. 13; i. 129, 4; 152, 7; 157, 2; vii. 83, 4; x. 38; 103, etc; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 220-226; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 135, n. 3. as Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra seem to have done, and as priests do even in the Epic from time to time. 137) Hopkins, op. cit., 13, 184. But a priest cannot be said to change caste by acting in this way. More generally the possibility of the occurrence of change of caste may be seen in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 138) x. 4, 1, 10. where Śyāparṇa Sāyakāyana is represented as speaking of his offspring as if they could have become the nobles, priests, and commons of the Śalvas; and in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 139) vii. 29. where Viśvantara is told that if the wrong offering were made his children would be of the three other castes. A drunken Ṛṣi of the Rigveda 140) iii. 43, 5. talks as if he could be converted into a king. On the other hand, certain kings, such as Para Āṭṇāra, are spoken of as performers of Sattras, ‘sacrificial sessions.’ 141) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 16, 3. Cf. for their share in the piling of the sacrificial altar, Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 5, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxii. 3 (Indische Studien, 3, 473); Weber, op. cit., 10. 25. As evidence for caste exchange all this amounts to little; later a Brahmin might become a king, while the Ṛṣi in the Rigveda is represented as speaking in a state of intoxication; the great kings could be called sacrificers if, for the nonce, they were consecrated (dīkṣita), and so temporarily became Brahmins. 142) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 1, 13; Weber, op. cit., 10, 17, and cf. the case of Janaka, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 6, 2, 1 et seq. The hypothetical passages, too, do not help much. It would be unwise to deny the possibility of caste exchange, but it is not clearly indicated by any record. Even cases like that of Satyakāma Jābāla do not go far; for ex hypothesi that teacher did not know who his father was, and the latter could quite well have been a Brahmin. It may therefore be held that the priests and the nobles practised hereditary occupations, and that either class was a closed body into which a man must be born. These two Varṇas may thus be fairly regarded as castes. The Vaiśyas offer more difficulty, for they practised a great variety of occupations (see Vaiśya). Fick 143) Op. cit., 19 et seq.; 162 et seq. concludes that there is no exact sense in which they can be called a caste, since, in the Buddhist literature, they were divided into various groups, which themselves practised endogamy such as the gahapatis, or smaller landowners, the setthis, or large merchants and members of the various guilds, while there are clear traces 144) Hopkins, The Mutual Relations of the Four Castes according to the Mānavadharmaśāstram, 78, 82 et seq. in the legal textbooks of a view that Brāhmaṇa and Kṣatriya stand opposed to all the other members of the community. But we need hardly accept this view for Vedic times, when the Vaiśya, the ordinary freeman of the tribe, formed a class or caste in all probability, which was severed by its free status from the Śūdras, and which was severed by its lack of priestly or noble blood from the two higher classes in the state. It is probably legitimate to hold that any Vaiśya could marry any member of the caste, and that the later divisions within the category of Vaiśyas are growths of divisions parallel with the original process by which priest and noble had grown into separate entities. The process can be seen to day when new tribes fall under the caste system: each class tries to elevate itself in the social scale by refusing to intermarry with inferior classes on equal terms--hypergamy is often allowed--and so those Vaiśyas who acquired wealth in trade (Śreṣṭhin) or agriculture (the Pāli Gahapatis) would become distinct, as sub-castes, from the ordinary Vaiśyas. But it is not legitimate to regard Vaiśya as a theoretic caste; rather it is an old caste which is in process of dividing into innumerable sub-castes under influences of occupation, religion, or geographical situation. Fick 145) Op. cit., 202 et seq. denies also that the Śūdras ever formed a single caste: he regards the term as covering the numerous inferior races and tribes defeated by the Āryan invaders, but originally as denoting only one special tribe. It is reasonable to suppose that Śūdra was the name given by the Vedic Indians to the nations opposing them, and that these ranked as slaves beside the three castes--nobles, priests, and people--just as in the Anglo-Saxon and early German constitution beside the priests, the nobiles or eorls, and the ingenui, ordinary freemen or ceorls, there was a distinct class of slaves proper; the use of a generic expression to cover them seems natural, whatever its origin (see Śūdra). In the Āryan view a marriage of Śūdras could hardly be regulated by rules; any Śūdra could wed another, if such a marriage could be called a marriage at all, for a slave cannot in early law be deemed to be capable of marriage proper. But what applied in the early Vedic period became no doubt less and less applicable later when many aboriginal tribes and princes must have come into the Āryan community by peaceful means, or by conquest, without loss of personal liberty, and when the term Śūdra would cover many sorts of people who were not really slaves, but were freemen of a humble character occupied in such functions as supplying the numerous needs of the village, like the Caṇḍālas, or tribes living under Āryan control, or independent, such as the Niṣādas. But it is also probable that the Śūdras came to include men of Āryan race, and that the Vedic period saw the degradation of Āryans to a lower social status. This seems, at any rate, to have been the case with the Rathakāras. In the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 146) i. 1, 4, 8. the Rathakāra is placed as a special class along with the Brāhmaṇas, Rājanyas, and Vaiśyas: this can hardly be interpreted except to mean that the Rathakāras were not included in the Āryan classes, though it is just possible that only a subdivision of the Vaiśyas is meant. There is other evidence 147) Cf. Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 1, 9, with the scholiast; iv. 7, 7; 9, 5; Weber, op. cit., 10, 12, 13. that the Rathakāras were regarded as Śūdras. But in the Atharvaveda 148) Av. iv. 5, 6. That the words karmāra and rathakāra are here appellatives, as Weber, op. cit., 17, 198. suggests, is quite impossible. the Rathakāras and the Karmāras appear in a position of importance in connexion with the selection of the king; these two classes are also referred to in an honourable way in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā; 149) xxx. 6. 7. Cf. xiv. 27; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 2, 1 (Rathakāra); 3, 1 (Karmāra). in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 150) xiii. 4, 2, 17. too, the Rathakāra is mentioned as a a person of high standing. It is impossible to accept the view suggested by Fick 151) Op. cit., 209, 210. that these classes were originally nonĀryan; we must recognize that the Rathakāras, in early Vedic times esteemed for their skill, later became degraded because of the growth of the feeling that manual labour was not dignified. The development of this idea was a departure from the Āryan conception; it is not unnatural, however undesirable, and has a faint parallel in the class distinctions of modern Europe. Similarly, the Karmāra, the Takṣan, 152) The name is applied to Bṛbu (Rv. vi. 45, 31) in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 11, 11. According to Brunnhofer, Iran und Turan, 127, the name is a people's name, but this is very unlikely. See Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 107. the Carmamna, or ‘tanner,’ the weaver and others, quite dignified occupations in the Rigveda, are reckoned as Śūdras in the Pāli texts. 153) Fick, op. cit., 160, 210. The later theory, which appears fully developed in the Dharma Sūtras, 154) Gautama Dharma Sūtra, iv; Vāsiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, xviii; Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra, i. 16. 17. deduces the several castes other than the original four from the intermarriage of the several castes. This theory has no justification in the early Vedic literature. In some cases it is obviously wrong; for example, the Sūta is said to be a caste of this kind, whereas it is perfectly clear that if the Sūtas did form a caste, it was one ultimately due to occupation. But there is no evidence at all that the Sūtas, Grāmaṇīs, and other members of occupations were real castes in the sense that they were endogamic in the early Vedic period. All that we can say is that there was a steady progress by which caste after caste was formed, occupation being an important determining feature, just as in modern times there are castes bearing names like Gopāla (‘cowherd’) Kaivarta or Dhīvara (‘fisherman’), and Vaṇij (‘merchant’). 155) Cf. Jolly, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 50, 507 et seq.; Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, xxxviii, xxxix. Fick 156) Op. cit., 184 et seq. finds in the Jātakas mention of a number of occupations whose members did not form part of any caste at all, such as the attendants on the court, the actors and dancers who went from village to village, and the wild tribes that lived in the mountains, fishermen, hunters, and so on. In Vedic times these people presumably fell under the conception of Śūdra, and may have included the Parṇaka, Paulkasa, Bainda, who are mentioned with many others in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’). The slaves also, whom Fick 157) Ibid., 197 et seq. includes in the same category, were certainly included in the term Śūdra. 5. Origin of the Castes.--The question of the origin of the castes presents some difficulty. The ultimate cause of the extreme rigidity of the caste system, as compared with the features of any other Āryan society, must probably be sought in the sharp distinction drawn from the beginning between the Āryan and the Śūdra. The contrast which the Vedic Indians felt as existing between themselves and the conquered population, and which probably rested originally on the difference of colour between the upper and the lower classes, tended to accentuate the natural distinctions of birth, occupation, and locality which normally existed among the Āryan Indians, but which among other Āryan peoples never developed into a caste system like that of India. The doctrine of hypergamy which marks the practical working of the caste system, seems clearly to point to the feeling that the Āryan could marry the Śūdrā, but not the Śūdra the Āryā. This distinction probably lies at the back of all other divisions: its force may be illustrated by the peculiar state of feeling as to mixed marriages, for example, in the Southern States of America and in South Africa, or even in India itself, between the new invaders from Europe and the mingled population which now peoples the country. Marriages between persons of the white and the dark race are disapproved in principle, but varying degrees of condemnation attach to (1) the marriage of a man of the white race with a woman of the dark race; (2) an informal connexion between these two; (3) a marriage between a woman of the white race and a man of the dark race; and (4) an informal connexion between these two. Each category, on the whole, is subject to more severe reprobation than the preceding one. This race element, it would seem, is what has converted social divisions into castes. There appears, then, to be a large element of truth in the theory, best represented by Risley, 158) Best stated and summed up in The Peoples of India. See also the summary in The Indian Empire, 1, chap. 6. which explains caste in the main as a matter of blood, and which holds that the higher the caste is, the greater is the proportion of Āryan blood. The chief rival theory is undoubtedly that of Senart, 159) Les Castes dans l'Inde. which places the greatest stress on the Āryan constitution of the family. According to Senart the Āryan people practised in affairs of marriage both a rule of exogamy, and one of endogamy. A man must marry a woman of equal birth, but not one of the same gens, according to Roman law as interpreted by Senart and Kovalevsky; 160) Famille et Propriété Primitives, 19, et seq. Cf. L. de la Vallée Poussin, Le Védisme, 15 et seq., with Le Brahmanisme, 7. and an Athenian must marry an Athenian woman, but not one of the same . In India these rules are reproduced in the form that one must not marry within the Gotra, but not without the caste. The theory, though attractively developed, is not convincing; the Latin and Greek parallels are not even probably accurate; 161) Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 472. and in India the rule forbidding marriage within the Gotra is one which grows; in strictness as the evidence grows later in date. 162) Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 74 et seq. On the other hand, it is not necessary to deny that the development of caste may have been helped by the family traditions of some gentes, or , or Gotras. The Patricians of Rome for a long time declined intermarriage with the plebeians; the Athenian Eupatridai seem to have kept their  pure from contamination by union with lower blood; and there may well have been noble families among the Vedic Indians who intermarried only among themselves. The Germans known to Tacitus 163) Germania, 7, 13, etc. were divided into nobiles and ingenui, and the Anglo-Saxons into eorls and ceorls, noble and non-noble freemen. 164) Medley, English Constitutional History,^2 21 et seq., and authorities there cited. In the formation of a kingdom minor chiefs, once petty kings, would become nobles. The origin of nobility need not be sought in the Vedic period proper, for it may already have existed. It may have been due to the fact that the king, whom we must regard as originally elected by the people, was as king often in close relation with, or regarded as an incarnation of, the deity; 165) E.g., Frazer, Early History of the Kingship and The Golden Bough (ed. 3), Part 1., The Magic Art and the Evolution of Kings. The traces of this conception in Āryan peoples are clear--e.g., the rex sacrificulus in Rome, the sacred functions of the Archon Basileus in Athens; cf. Ridgway, Origin of Tragedy, p. 29. and that hereditary kingship would tend to increase the tradition of especially sacred blood: thus the royal family and its offshoots would be anxious to maintain the purity of their blood. In India, beside the sanctity of the king, there was the sanctity of the priest. Here we have in the family exclusiveness of king and nobles, and the similar exclusiveness of a priesthood which was not celibate, influences that make for caste, especially when accompanying the deep opposition between the general folk and the servile aborigines. Caste, once created, naturally developed in different directions. Nesfield 166) Brief View of the Caste System of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, Allahabad, 1885. was inclined to see in occupation the one ground of caste. It is hardly necessary seriously to criticize this view considered as an ultimate explanation of caste, but it is perfectly certain that gilds of workers tend to become castes. The carpenters (Takṣan), the chariot-makers (Rathakāra), the fishermen (Dhaivara) and others are clearly of the type of caste, and the number extends itself as time goes on. But this is not to say that caste is founded on occupation pure and simple in its first origin, or that mere difference of occupation would have produced the system of caste without the interposition of the fundamental difference between Āryan and Dāsa or Śūdra blood and colour. This difference rendered increasingly important what the history of the Āryan peoples shows us to be declining, the distinction between the noble and the non-noble freemen, a distinction not of course ultimate, but one which seems to have been developed in the Āryan people before the separation of its various branches. It is well known that the Iranian polity presents a division of classes comparable in some respects 167) Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 243, 244. with the Indian polity. The priests (Atharvas) and warriors (Rathaesthas) are unmistakably parallel, and the two lower classes seem to correspond closely to the Pāli Gahapatis, and perhaps to the Śūdras. 168) Senart, op. cit., 141. But they are certainly not castes in the Indian sense of the word. There is no probability in the view of Senart 169) Ibid. 140. or of Risley 170) Indian Empire, 1, 336-348. that the names of the old classes were later superimposed artificially on a system of castes that were different from them in origin. We cannot say that the castes existed before the classes, and that the classes were borrowed by India from Iran, as Risley maintains, ignoring the early Brāhmaṇa evidence for the four Varṇas, and treating the transfer as late. Nor can we say with Senart that the castes and classes are of independent origin. If there had been no Varṇa, caste might never have arisen; both colour and class occupation are needed for a plausible account of the rise of caste. 171) The Indian theories of the origin of caste are merely religious or philosophical, and have no value. See for them, Rv. x. 90 (which is repeated in other Saṃhitās); Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 1, 4 et seq.; ibid., iv. 3, 10, 1-3 = Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 5 = Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 28-30; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, viii. 4, 3, 1 et seq. For the origin of the Brahmins, see Av. iv. 6, 1; xv. 9, 1; of the Rājanya, Av. xv. 8, 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 13, 1 et seq.; Muir, 12, 8 et seq.; Zimmer, op. cit., 217-220. The most important collection of texts on caste are those of Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, and of Weber, Indische Studien, 10, where practically all the data of the Brāhmaṇas are extracted; there have to be added only the data of the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, which are merely confirmatory of those of the Taittirīya and Kāṭhaka Saṃhitās, The Epic materials concerning caste are given by Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, who has also analyzed the caste relations of the Mānavadharmaśāstra in The Mutual Relation of the Four Castes according to the Mānavadharmaśāstram. Cf. also Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 212 et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 185 et seq.; Senart, Les Castes dans l'Inde; Barth, Revue de l'Histoire des Religions, 1894, 75 et seq.; Jolly, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 50, 507 et seq.; Oldenberg, ibid., 51, 267-290, a valuable criticism of Senart's views; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 152 et seq.; 425 et seq.; Schlagintweit, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 33, 549; Shridhar V. Katkar, History of Caste in India. The Jātaka evidence is all collected by Fick, Die sociale Gliederung im nordöstlichen Indien zu Buddha's Zeit (1897); its value is considerable, but its date is extremely doubtful, and it certainly cannot be regarded as really contemporary with Buddha (fifth century B.C.). The Dharma Sūtras also give full details, but the¤ir date likewise is uncertain.

vashaashvya|वशअश्व्य
1. Vaśa Aśvya is the name in the Rigveda 1) i. 112, 10; 116, 21; viii. 8, 20; 24, 14; 46, 21. 23; 50, 9; x. 40, 7. of a protégé of the Aśvins. He is also mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 2) xvi. 11, 13. as having received bounty from Pṛthuśravas Kānīta. He is the reputed author of a Rigvedic hymn, 3) viii. 46. which is repeatedly referred to by his name Vaśa. 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, viii. 6, 2, 3; ix. 3, 3, 19; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, i. 5, 1, 2; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, ii. 10. 11. Cf. Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 38, 39. Cf. also Vyaśva.

vasha|वश
2. Vaśa, plur., is the name of a tribe mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) viii. 14, 3. as being in Madhyadeśa along with the Kurus, the Pañcālas, and the Uśīnaras. They are also connected with the Matsyas according to the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad. 2) iv. 1 (reading sa-Vaśa-Matsyeṣu for the savasan-Matsyeṣu of the manuscripts, which is otherwise emended to SatvanMatsyeṣu, Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 36, n. 2; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 367). The Vaśas and Uśīnaras are spoken of as united in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa: 3) i. 2, 9, where the text has Śavasa-Uśīnareṣu, which is nonsense. Cf. Sa-Vaśa-Uśīnarāṇām in Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 14, 3. and n. 2. the names 4) As both derived from the root vaś, ‘desire.’ Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 393, n.; 407, n. seem to indicate that the Vaśas and Uśīnaras were connected.

vashaa|वशा
वशा<BR> denotes ‘cow’ in the Rigveda 1) ii. 7, 5; vi. 63, 9; x. 91, 14, etc. and later. 2) Av. iv. 24, 4; x. 10, 2; xii. 4, 1, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 4, 4. 5; iii. 4, 2, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiii. 4, etc. According to the commentators, the word means a ‘barren cow,’ but this is not a necessary sense except in a few passages. 3) Av. vii. 113, 2, where the Parivṛktā, ‘rejected wife,’ is compared with a Vaśā. In xii. 4 (where vaśā alternates with go) there is no indication that Vaśā means a barren cow, except perhaps in verse 16, on which cf. Bloomfield. Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 656, 658. The Brahmins there claim as their own a barren cow. A sūta-vaśā--i.e., a cow barren after once calving--is mentioned in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 5, 4. etc. In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 2, 2, and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2. 5, 2, used with Avi, Sūtā denotes a ‘mother sheep,’ ‘ewe.’ 

vasati|वसति
वसति<BR> denotes in the Rigveda 1) i. 31, 15; v. 2, 6. and later 2) Vājasaneyī¤ Saṃhitā, xviii. 15; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 5, 4; iii. 7, 3, 3, etc. ‘abode,’ ‘house.’

vasanta|वसन्त
वसन्त,<BR> ‘spring,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) x. 90, 6; 161, 4. and later. 2) Av. vi. 55, 2; viii. 2, 22; xii. 1, 36, etc. It is regularly identified with the first of the months. See Ṛtu.

vasaavi|वसावि
वसावि<BR> in one passage of the Rigveda 1) x. 73, 4. denotes, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. a ‘treasure house.’

vasiShTha|वसिष्ठ
वसिष्ठ<BR> is the name of one of the most prominent priestly figures of Vedic tradition. The seventh Maṇḍala of the Rigveda is ascribed to him; this ascription is borne out by the fact that the Vasiṣṭhas 1) Rv. vii. 7, 7; 12, 3; 23, 6; 33, 1 et seq.; 37, 4; 39, 7; 40, 7; 76, 6. 7; 77, 6; 80, 1; 90, 7; 91, 7; x. 15, 8; 66, 14; 122, 8. and Vasiṣṭha 2) Rv. vii. 9, 6; 13, 4. 21; 22, 3; 23, 1; 26, 5; 33, 11 et seq.; 42, 6; 59, 3; 70, 6; 73, 3; 86, 5; 88, 1; 95, 6; 96, 1; x. 65, 15; 150, 5; i. 112, 9. are frequently mentioned in that Maṇḍala, besides being sometimes referred to elsewhere. That by the name Vasiṣṭha a definite individual is always meant is most improbable, as Oldenberg 3) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 204 et seq. Cf. vii. 23, 1 (singular) with verse 6 (plural). shows; Vasiṣṭha must normally mean simply ‘a Vasiṣṭha.’ But it is not necessary to deny that a real Vasiṣṭha existed, for one hymn 4) Rv. vii. 18. As to vii. 33, Oldenberg and Geldner differ. See Vedische Studien, 2, 130. But it is rather doubtful whether it can possibly be said to be as early as vii. 18, or to have any claim to be really an utterance of Vasiṣṭha. seems to show clear traces of his authorship, and of his assistance to Sudās against the ten kings. The most important feature of Vasiṣṭha's life was apparently his hostility to Viśvāmitra. The latter was certainly 5) See Rv. iii. 33. 53; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 328 et seq. at one time the Purohita (‘domestic priest’) of Sudās, but he seems to have been deposed from that post, to have joined Sudās' enemies, and to have taken part in the onslaught of the kings against him, for the hymn of Sudās' triumph 4) Rv. vii. 18. As to vii. 33, Oldenberg and Geldner differ. See Vedische Studien, 2, 130. But it is rather doubtful whether it can possibly be said to be as early as vii. 18, or to have any claim to be really an utterance of Vasiṣṭha. has clear references to the ruin Viśvāmitra brought on his allies. 6) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 260 et seq. Oldenberg, 7) Op. cit., 204, n. 3. however, holds that the strife of Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha is not to be found in the Rigveda. On the other hand, Geldner 8) Op. cit., 2, 158 et seq. is hardly right in finding in the Rigveda 9) iii. 53, 15. 16. 21-24, the last four verses being the famous Vasiṣṭhadveṣiṇyaḥ, which Durga, the commentator on the Nirukta, declines to explain, because he was a Kāpiṣṭhala Vāsiṣṭha (see Muir, op. cit., 12, 344; Bṛhaddevatā, iv. 117 et seq., with Macdonell's notes). What the verses really mean is not at all certain. See Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 254 et seq. a compressed account indicating the rivalry of Śakti, Vasiṣṭha's son, with Viśvāmitra, the acquisition by Viśvāmitra of special skill in speech, and the revenge of Viśvāmitra, who secured the death of Śakti by Sudās' servants, an account which is more fully related by Ṣaḍguruśiṣya, 10) Cf. Sāyaṇa on Rv. vii. 32, and Macdonell's edition of the Sarvānukramaṇī, 107; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 119. which appeared in the Śāṭyāyanaka, 11) See the note in the Anukramaṇī on vii. 32, where both the Tāṇḍaka and the Śāṭyāyanaka are quoted (Muir, op. cit., 12, 328). and to which reference seems to be made in the brief notices of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 12) vii. 4, 7, 1. In iii. 1, 7, 3; v. 4, 11, 3, also Vasiṣṭha is a foe of Viśvāmitra. and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 13) iv. 7, 3; viii. 2, 3; xix. 3, 8; xxi. 11, 2. The story is alluded to in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, iv. 8, and in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 150; iii. 26. 83. 149. 204. In ii. 390 it is definitely stated, as in the Śāṭyāyanaka (n. 10), that Śakti was cast into the fire by the Saudāsas. regarding Vasiṣṭha's sons having been slain, and his overcoming the Saudāsas. But it is important to note that no mention is made in these authorities of Sudās himself being actually opposed to Vasiṣṭha, while in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 14) vii. 34, 9; viii. 21, 11. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 11, 14. Vasiṣṭha appears as the Purohita and consecrator of Sudās Paijavana. Yāska 15) Nirukta, ii. 24; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxvi. 12, 13. recognizes Viśvāmitra as the Purohita of Sudās; this accords with what seems to have been the fact that Viśvāmitra originally held the post. Probably, however, with the disappearance of Sudās, Viśvāmitra recovered his position, whereupon Vasiṣṭha in revenge for the murder of his sons secured in some way unspecified the defeat of the Saudāsas. 16) Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 121 et seq., considered that the Vasiṣṭhas were finally successful in the effort to remove the Viśvāmitras from favour. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 120; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 34, doubted this, and Muir, op. cit., 12, 371-375, held the problem to be insoluble. Roth and Muir, however, both complicated the question by regarding the Bharatas as enemies of the Tṛtsus, which (see Tṛtsu) is not at all probable, though it is still the view of Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 41, 42. At any rate it is hardly necessary to suppose that the enmity of the Saudāsas and Vasiṣṭhas was permanent. There is evidence 17) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xv. 4, 24; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 34. that the Bharatas had the Vasiṣṭhas as Purohitas, while other versions 18) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 5, 2, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 17. regard them as Purohitas for people (prajāḥ) generally. It seems that the Vasiṣṭhas were pioneers in adopting the rule that Purohitas should act as Brahman priest 19) Vasiṣṭha was Brahman at the sacrifice of Śunaḥśepa, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 16; Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xv. 21, 4. at the sacrifice: the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 20) xii. 6, 1, 41. Cf. iv. 6, 6, 5. states that the Vasiṣṭhas were once the only priests to act as Brahmans, but that later any priest could serve as such. 21) Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, i. 5; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 35. A rivalry with Jamadgni and Viśvāmitra is reported in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 22) iii. 1, 7, 3. Cf. n. 11. Parāśara and Śatayātu are associated with Vasiṣṭha in the Rigveda, 23) vii. 18, 21. being apparently, as Geldner 24) Vedische Studien, 2, 132. thinks, the grandson and a son of Vasiṣṭha. According to Pischel, 25) Vedische Studien, 2, 55 et seq. in another hymn, 26) vii. 55. Aufrecht, Indische Studien, 4, 337, took the hymn to refer to a lover's visit to a maiden. Cf. Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 370; Bṛhaddevatā, vi. 11, with Macdonell's notes. Vasiṣṭha appears as attempting to steal the goods of his father Varuṇa; Geldner 27) Vedische Studien, 2, 138. So also Nirukta, v. 13; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 231, n. 97; Bṛhaddevatā, v. 150. 151. also shows that the Rigveda 28) vii. 33, 11. contains a clear reference to Vasiṣṭha's being a son of Varuṇa and the nymph Urvaśī. Perhaps this explains the fact that the Vasiṣṭhas are called the Tṛtsus in one passage of the Rigveda; 29) vii. 83, 8. for being of miraculous parentage, Vasiṣṭha would need adoption into a Gotra, that of the princes whom he served, and to whom Agastya seems to have introduced him. There are numerous other references to Vasiṣṭha as a Ṛṣi in Vedic literature, 30) Rv. i. 112, 9; vii. 88, 4; 96, 3; x. 95, 17; 181, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvi. 19; xx. 9; xxxii. 2 (Indische Studien, 3, 478); Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 4, 12; ii. 7, 9; iv. 2, 9; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 10, 5; Av. iv. 29, 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 18, 3; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxvi. 14; xxix. 2. 3; xxx. 3; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 13; 15, 2; 18, 6; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 2, 2; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 2, 4, etc. in the Sūtras, 31) See Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 89-92; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 35. and in the Epic, where he and Viśvāmitra fight out their rivalry. 32) Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 375-414.

vasu|वसु
वसु<BR> in the Rigveda 1) iv. 17, 11. 13; 20, 8; vi. 55, 3; viii. 13, 22, etc. and later 2) Av. vii. 115, 2; ix. 4, 3; x. 8, 20; xiv. 2, 8, etc. denotes ‘wealth,’ ‘property.’

vasukra|वसुक्र
वसुक्र<BR> and his wife are the reputed composers of certain hymns of the Rigveda. 1) x. 27-29. The ascription goes back to the Rigveda Āraṇyakas. 2) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, i. 2, 2; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, i. 3.

vasurochis|वसुरोचिस्
वसु-रोचिस्<BR> is a name occurring only once in the Rigveda 1) viii. 34, 16. in a form which may be interpreted as either plural or singular. In the former alternative it denotes a family of singers; 2) Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 162. in the latter a patron. 3) Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 175, n.

vastu|वस्तु
वस्तु<BR> as a designation of time is the ‘early morning’ in the Rigveda. 1) i. 79, 6; 104, 1; 179, 1, etc. So Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxviii. 12. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 361. 

vastra|वस्त्र
वस्त्र<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 26, 1; 134, 4; iii. 39, 2; v. 29, 15, etc. and later 2) Av. v. 1, 3; ix. 5. 25; xii. 3, 21, etc. denotes ‘dress,’ ‘clothing.’ See Yāsas.

vasna|वस्न
वस्न<BR> in the Rigveda 1) iv. 24, 9. where the phrase bhūyasā vasnam acarat kanīyaḥ must mean ‘with a greater price he obtained a lesser value.’ For the exact sense, cf. Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 419, 420. and later 2) Av. xii. 2, 36 (‘price’) = Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 49 = Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 4, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, ix. 5; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 10, 2, where the sense seems to be ‘let us barter food and drink like wares.’ Cf. also vasnikā, ‘worth a price,’ in Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 3, 13. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 247; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 382. denotes the ‘price’ paid for anything or its ‘value,’ or the thing itself as an object of purchase, ‘ware.’

vahatu|वहतु
वहतु<BR> is the regular name in the Rigveda 1) i. 184, 3; iv. 58, 9; x. 17, 1 (= Av. iii. 31, 5); 32, 3; 85, 13 et seq. and later 2) Av. x. 1, 1; xiv. 2, 9, 12, 66, 73; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 7, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 1, 2. for the ceremonial conducting of the bride from the house of her parents to that of her husband.

vahni|वह्नि
वह्नि,<BR> ‘carrier,’ denotes any draught animal--e.g., a ‘horse,’ 1) Rv. ii. 24, 13; 37, 3; iii. 6, 2, etc. a ‘goat,’ 2) Rv. vi. 57, 3. or an ‘ox.’ 3) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 2, 5, etc.

vahya|वह्य
वह्य<BR> denotes in the Rigveda 1) vii. 55, 8. and the Atharvaveda 2) iv. 5, 3; 20, 3; xiv. 2, 30. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 154. a ‘couch’ or ‘bed’ of a comfortable kind used by women.

vaakovaakya|वाकोवाक्य
वाको-वाक्य,<BR> ‘dialogue,’ is the name given in the Brāhmaṇas 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 6, 9, 20; xi. 5, 6, 8; 7, 5; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vii. 1, 2, 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. to certain portions of the Vedic texts. In one place 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 6, 9, 20. the Brahmodya is said to be a dialogue; very probably in all the passages the Brahmodya is meant by this term. Geldner's view 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 291. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 267; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 98, n. 3. It is certain that ‘logic’ is not meant, though Max Müller so renders it in his translation of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. is different: he sees in the Vākovākya an essential part of the Itihāsa-Purāṇa, the dialogue or dramatic element as opposed to the narrative portion.

vaach|वाच्
वाच्,<BR> ‘speech,’ plays a great part in Vedic speculation, but only a few points are of other than mythological significance. Speech is in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) iv. 1, 3, 16. There are quite different accounts in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiv. 5; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 11, 5. Oldenberg finds traces of the origin of the legend in Rv. viii. 100; but see v. Schroeder, Mysterium und Mimus, 339 et seq.; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1911, 993 et seq. divided into four kinds -that of men, of animals, of birds (vayāṃsi), and of small creeping things (kṣudraṃ sarīsṛpam). The discrimination or making articulate of speech is ascribed to Indra by the Saṃhitās. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 4, 7, 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 8. The ‘speech’ of the following musical instruments -Tūṇava, Vīṇā, Dundubhi 3) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vi. 5, 1013; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 4, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 6, 8; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiii. 4.<BR> --is mentioned, and in one Saṃhitā 4) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. also that of the axle of a chariot. The speech of the Kuru-Pañcālas was especially renowned, 5) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 3, 15. The difficult phrase has caused some doubt as to the sense, for uttarāhi vāg vadati Kurupañcālatrā seems to mean ‘speech in the north among the KuruPañcālas,’ this version being slightly supported by the Kāṇva recension of the passage quoted by Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xlii. n. 1. That recension, however, is not merely obscure, but it seems to couple the Kurus with the northern Mahāvṛṣas (so we must emend Mahāviṣeṣu), and it cannot be relied on. Eggeling's attempt to remove the difficulty by taking uttarāhi as ‘higher’ in tone is not satisfactory. The most probable solution is that of Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 191, who takes Kurupañcālatrā to be ‘as among the Kuru-Pañcālas,’ which gives a good sense, especially when it is remembered that the northerners were probably the Uttara-Kurus in Kaśmīr, which seems to have been a home of Sanskrit (cf. Franke, Pāli und Sanskrit, 89). as well as that of the northern country, according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, 6) vii. 6. so that men went there to study the language. On the other hand, barbarisms in speech were known, and were to be avoided. 7) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 1, 23. 24, where the Asuras are described as saying he 'lavaḥ, perhaps for he 'rayaḥ But the Kāṇva version is different See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East 26, 31, n. 3. One division of speech referred to 8) See Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiv. 5; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 11, 5 (where the words yaś ca veda vaś ca na replace the ordinary distinction of daivī and mānuṣī: perhaps vedo should be read); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 2, 1, 34; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 18, 13; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, i. 3, 1; a Brāhmaṇa in Nirukta, xiii. 9, etc. is that of the divine (daivī) and the human (mānuṣī), of which some specimens are given, such as om, the divine counterpart of tathā, and so forth. The Brahmin is said to know both; 9) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, loc. cit.; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, loc. cit., etc. it seems best to regard the distinction not as between Sanskrit and Apabhraṃśa, as Sāyaṇa 10) See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 200, n. suggests, but as between the Sanskrit of the ritual and the hymns and that of ordinary life. Reference is also made to Āryan 11) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 2, 5; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, viii. 9. and to Brahmin 12) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, i. 5, 2. speech, by which Sanskrit, as opposed to non-Āryan tongues, seems to be meant. The Vrātyas are described as speaking the language of the initiated (dīkṣita-vāc), though not themselves initiated (a-dīkṣita), but as calling that which is easy to utter (a-durukta), difficult to utter. 13) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 1, 9. Cf. Lévi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 34, 35; Weber, Indian Literature, 175-180; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 179, 180; 196. This may mean that the non-Brahminical Indians were advancing more rapidly than the Brahminical tribes to Prākrit speech, especially if it is legitimate to connect the Vrātyas with the barbarians in speech alluded to in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 7) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 1, 23. 24, where the Asuras are described as saying he 'lavaḥ, perhaps for he 'rayaḥ But the Kāṇva version is different See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East 26, 31, n. 3.

vaachaknavii|वाचक्नवी
वाचक्नवी,<BR> ‘descendant of Vacaknu,’ is the patronymic of a woman with the further patronymic of Gārgī, who appears as a student of Brahman in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) iii. 6, 1; 8, 1. Cf. Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 4, 4; Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 10; Atharvaveda Parisiṣṭa, xliii. 4, 23.

vaaja|वाज
वाज<BR> from the meaning of ‘strength,’ ‘speed,’ in its application to horses derives the sense of ‘race’ 1) Rv. ii. 23, 13; iii. 11, 9; 37, 6; 42, 6; v. 35, 1; 86, 2, etc. and ‘prize,’ 2) Rv. i. 64, 13; ii. 26, 3; 31, 7; iii. 2, 3; viii. 103, 5, etc. or merely ‘prosperity.’ 3) Rv. i. 27, 5; 92, 7; vi. 45, 21. 23, etc.; Av. xiii. 1, 22; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xviii. 7, 1. 12. That it ever means ‘horse’ is most improbable, that sense being given by Vājin. 4) See Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 10 et seq., where he explains otherwise all the passages cited for the sense by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 8.

vaajapeya|वाजपेय
वाजपेय<BR> is the name of a ceremony which, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) v. 1, 5, 2. 3. and later authorities, 2) See Weber, U7ber den Rājasūya; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 147 et seq. is only performed by a Brahmin or a Kṣatriya. The same Brāhmaṇa 3) v. 1, 1, 13; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 1, 1, 2. insists that this sacrifice is superior to the Rājasūya, but the consensus of other authorities 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 2, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 6, 1; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ix. 9, 19; Lāṭyāyana Srauta Sūtra, viii. 11, 1, etc. assigns to it merely the place of a preliminary to the Bṛhaspatisava in the case of a priest, and to the Rājasūya in the case of a king, while the Śatapatha 5) v. 2, 1, 2. Cf. Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, xiv. 1, 2. is compelled to identify the Bṛhaspatisava with the Vājapeya. The essential ceremony is a chariot race in which the sacrificer is victorious. There is evidence in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 6) xv. 1. See Weber, op. cit., 41 et seq. showing that once the festival was one which any Āryan could perform. Hillebrandt, 7) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 247. indeed, goes so far as to compare it with the Olympic games; but there is hardly much real ground for this: the rite seems to have been developed round a primitive habit of chariot racing, transformed into a ceremony which by sympathetic magic secures the success of the sacrificer. In fact 8) Sacred Books of the East, 41, xxiv, xxv. Eggeling seems correct in holding that the Vājapeya was a preliminary rite performed by a Brahmin prior to his formal installation as a Purohita, or by a king prior to his consecration. The Kuru Vājapeya was specially well known. 9) Sāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xv. 3, 14 et seq.; Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, xviii. 3, 7.

vaajabandhu|वाजबन्धु
वाज-बन्धु<BR> in one verse of the Rigveda (viii. 68, 19) may be a proper name. It may, however, merely be an adjective meaning ‘ally in conflict.’ 

vaajaratnaayana|वाजरत्नायन
वाज-रत्नायन,<BR> ‘descendant of Vājaratna,’ is the patronymic of Somaśuṣman in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 21, 5).

वाज-श्रवस्<BR> is mentioned in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1) vi. 4, 33 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 5, 3 Kāṇva). as a pupil of Jihvāvant Bādhyoga.

vaajashravasa|वाजश्रवस
वाज-श्रवस,<BR> ‘descendant of Vājaśravas,’ is the patronymic of Kuśri in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) x. 5, 5, 1. It is also the patronymic of the father of Naciketas in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 2) iii. 11, 8, 1. Cf. Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad, i. 1, with different names, on which see Weber, Indian Literature, 157, n. where the name is apparently Uśant, though it is understood by Sāyaṇa as a participle in the sense of ‘desiring.’ The Vājaśravases are in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa said to have been sages. 3) i. 3, 10, 3. They were Gotamas. 4) Cf. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 11, 8.

vaajasaneya|वाजसनेय

His school, the Vājasaneyins, are mentioned in the Sūtras. 3) Anupada Sūtra, vii. 12; viii. 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 44, 53, 83, 283; 2, 9; 4, 140, 257, 309; 10, 37, 76, 393, etc.

In one passage 2) x. 56, 2. it is perhaps, as Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 133. thinks, a proper name, that of a son of Bṛhaduktha, but this view seems forced.

vaajina|वाजिन
वाजिन<BR> in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 3, 10; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 21. 23. and the Brāhmaṇas 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 4, 21; iii. 3, 3, 2; ix. 5, 1, 57, etc. Cf.

vaaNa|वाण
वाण<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 85, 10; viii. 20, 8; ix. 97, 8; x. 32, 4. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 67. and the Atharvaveda 2) x. 2, 17. denotes ‘instrumental music’ according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary; but in the later Saṃhitās 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 9, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 5. and the Brāhmaṇas 4) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 6, 12; xiv. 7, 8; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v. 1, 4, etc. a ‘harp’ or ‘lyre’ with a hundred strings (śata-tantu), used at the Mahāvrata ceremony. The Rigveda 5) x. 32, 4. clearly refers to the seven ‘notes’ (dhātu) of the instrument, which are called elsewhere 6) i. 164, 24; iii. 1, 6; 7, 1; ix. 103, 3, etc. the seven Vāṇīs, unless the latter expression be taken as referring to the metres. 7) Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 64. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 289, who thinks the meaning is ‘flute’ in Rv. i. 85, 10, but not necessarily. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 138, render it ‘voice’ in i. 85, 10; ix. 97, 8, and ‘arrow’ in viii. 20, 8; ix. 50, 1, and this sense is accepted in Böhtlingk's Dictionary, s.v. 1 vāṇa for ix. 50, 1.

vaaNija|वाणिज
वाणिज<BR> denotes a ‘merchant’ as a hereditary profession (‘son of a Vaṇij’) in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 17; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 14, 1.

vaaNii|वाणी
वाणी<BR> See Vāṇa.

vaaNiichii|वाणीची
वाणीची<BR> occurs in a verse of the Rigveda (v. 75, 4), where the St. Petersburg Dictionary ascribes to it the sense of ‘musical instrument.’ 

vaata|वात
वात<BR> is the regular word for ‘wind’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 28, 6; ii. 1, 6; 38, 3; iii. 14, 3, etc. and later. 2) Av. iv. 5, 2; v. 5, 7; xii. 1, 51, etc. Five winds are mentioned. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6; 1, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxii. 6. In one passage 4) Rv. v. 53, 8. Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 45, who compares also Rv. x. 137, 2, which refers to two winds. sees a reference to the north-east monsoon. Cf. Salilavāta.

वात-रशन,<BR> ‘wind-girt,’ is applied to the Munis in the Rigveda 1) x. 136, 2. and to the Ṛṣis in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka. 2) i. 23, 2; 24, 4; ii. 7, 1. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 78, was inclined, though without sufficient reason, to take the word as a proper name. Naked ascetics, such as are known throughout later Indian religious history, are evidently meant

vaatavant|vaatavat|वातवत्|वातवन्त्
वातवन्त्<BR> is the name of a Ṛṣi in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xxv. 3, 6). He and Dṛti performed a certain Sattra or sacrificial session, but by stopping at a particular time he came to grief, and his descendants, the Vātavatas, were less prosperous than the Dārteyas.

वात्स्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Vatsa,’ is the name of one or more teachers. One is mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 1) viii. 3. where the Aitareya Āraṇyaka 2) iii. 2, 3. in the parallel passage has Bādhva. Others occur in the Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad as pupils of Kuśri, 3) vi. 5, 4 Kāṇva.

It is used, however, in the Atharvaveda 4) x. 6, 3 (where the manuscripts all have vāsyā: perhaps this is really a different word). of the carpenter's knife; here it may mean ‘awl,’ in accordance with Sāyaṇa's view. 5 Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 301.

vaasaHpalpuulii|वासःपल्पूली
वासः-पल्पूली,<BR> ‘washer of clothes,’ is the name of one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 12; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 7, 1.

vaasas|वासस्
वासस्<BR> is the most usual word in the Rigveda 1) i. 34, 1; 115, 4; 162, 16; viii. 3, 24; x. 26, 6; 102, 2, etc. and later 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 9, 7; 11, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ii. 32; xi. 40; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, etc. A garment of Kuśa grass is mentioned in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 1, 8, as worn by the wife of the sacrificer at the consecration, but it is doubtful whether such dresses were normally worn. Cf. also kausumbha-paridhāna, ‘a silken garment,’ Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xi. 4. for ‘clothing.’ Clothes were often woven of sheep's wool (cf. Ūrṇā); the god Pūṣan is called a ‘weaver of garments’ (vāsevāya) 3) Rv. x. 26, 6. because of his connexion with the fashioning of forms. The garments worn were often embroidered (cf. Peśas), and the Maruts are described as wearing mantles adorned with gold. 4) Rv. v. 55, 6 (hiraṇyayān athān). When the ‘giver of garments’ (vāso-dā) 5) Rv. x. 107, 2. Cf. vastra-dā, v. 24, 8. is mentioned along with the giver of horses and gold, ornamental garments are probably meant. There are several references in the Rigveda 6) Rv. i. 85, 1; 92, 4; ix. 96, 1, x. 1, 6. to the Indians' love of ornament, which is attested by Megas thenes for his day. 7) See Strabo, p. 709; Arrian, Indica, v. 9. The Rigveda also presents epithets like su-vasana 8) Rv. ix. 97, 50. and su-rabhi, 9) With atka, vi. 29, 3; x. 123, 7. this word may possibly indicate that early Vedic dress was fitted like the Minoan style of dress, and unlike the later Achæan style as seen in Homer (cf. Lang, The World of Homer, 60 et seq.). implying that garments were becoming or well-fitting. The Vedic Indian seems often to have worn three garments -an undergarment (cf. Nīvi), 10) Av. viii. 2, 16; xiv. 2, 50. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 1, 3; Vājasanevi Saṃhitā, iv. 10, etc. a garment, 11) Vāsas in the narrower sense, Av. viii. 2, 16. and an overgarment (cf. Adhīvāsa), 12) Rv. i. 140, 9; 162, 16; x. 5, 4. which was presumably a mantle, and for which the names Atka and Drāpi also seem to be used. This accords with the description of the sacrificial garments given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 13) v. 3, 5, 20 et seq. See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 85 et seq. which comprise a Tārpya, perhaps a ‘silken undergarment’; secondly, a garment of undyed wool, and then a mantle, while the ends of the turban, after being tied behind the neck, are brought forward and tucked away in front. The last point would hardly accord with the usual practice in ordinary life, but seems to be a special sacrificial ritual act. A similar sort of garments in the case of women appears to be alluded to in the Atharvaveda 14) viii. 2, 16; xiv. 2, 50. and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 15) v. 2, 1, 8. There is nothing to show exactly what differences there were between male and female costume, nor what was exactly the nature of the clothes in either case. It is important to note that the Vedic Indian evidently assumed that all civilized persons other than inspired Munis would wear clothing of some sort. 16) Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 1, 1; and iii. 1, 2, 13-17, where the fact that man alone wears clothes is accounted for by a silly legend. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 261, 262. See also Vasana, Vastra, Otu, Tantu. For the use of skin garments, see Mala.

vaasiShTha|वासिष्ठ
वासिष्ठ,<BR> ‘descendant of Vasiṣṭha,’ is the patronymic of Sātyahavya, a teacher mentioned several times in the later Saṃhitās, 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 6, 2, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 17 (Indische Studien, 3, 474); Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 3, 9; iv. 8, 7. For his enmity to Atyarāti, see Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 23, 9, 10. of Rauhina in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, 2) i. 12, 7. and of Caikitāneya. 3) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 42, 1; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1; Indische Studien, 4, 384. Cf. Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 10.

वि-चृत्<BR> in the dual is found in three passages of the Atharvaveda, 1) ii. 8, 1; vi. 110, 2; 121, 3. See also iii. 7, 4. where Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. sees in the term the name of two stars, while in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 3) iv. 4, 10, 2. he thinks they mean the Nakṣatra called Mūla. There can, however, be no doubt that the asterism is intended in all the passages. 4) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 356; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 361, points out that Vicṛtau are  and  Scorpionis, while Mūla includes the tail as a whole.

Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 12; Imperial Gazetteer of India, 14, 160. in the Nadīstuti (‘Praise of Rivers’). 2) The rareness of the name in the Rigveda points to the Panjab not having been the seat of the activity of the greater part of the Vedic Indians. It is the Hydaspes of Alexander's historians, more correctly reproduced by Ptolemy as Bidaspes. The name appears in the Mohammedan historians corrupted to Bihat or Wihat, and survives in the modern Kashmīrī form of Veth.

विदग्ध शाकल्य<BR> is the name of a teacher, a contemporary and rival of Yājñavalkya at the court of Janaka of Videha in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 1) iii. 9, 1; iv. 1, 17 (Mādhyaṃdina = 7 Kāṇva). the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, 2) ii. 76 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 239). and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 3) xi. 6, 3, 3.

vidatha|विदथ
विदथ<BR> is a word of obscure sense, confined mainly to the Rigveda. According to Roth, 1) Rv. i. 31, 6; 117, 25; iii. 1, 18; 27, 7; iv. 38, 4; vi. 8, 1; x. 85, 26; 92, 2; Av. iv. 25, 1; v. 20, 12; xviii. 3, 70, etc. the sense is primarily ‘order,’ then the concrete body which gives orders, then ‘assembly’ for secular 2) ii. 1, 4; 27, 12, 17; iii. 38, 5, 6; v. 63, 2; vii. 66, 10; viii. 39, 1; x. 12, 7; Av. xvii. 1, 15. So Whitney renders the word in Av. i. 13, 4, as ‘council,’ Translation of the Atharvaveda, 15. or religious ends, 3) Rv. i. 60, 1; ii. 4, 8; 39, 1; iii. 1, 1; 56, 8, etc. or for war. 4) Rv. i. 166, 2; 167, 6; v. 59, 2, etc. Oldenberg 5) Sacred Books of the East, 46, 26 et seq. But in Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft, 54, 609-611, he falls back on the derivation from vidh, ‘worship.’ Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 23, n. 10. once thought that the main idea is ‘ordinance’ (from vi-dhā, ‘dispose,’ ‘ordain’), and thence ‘sacrifice.’ Ludwig 6) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 259 et seq. thinks that the root idea is an ‘assembly,’ especially of the Maghavans and the Brahmins. Geldner 7) Vedische Studien, 1, 147; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 52, 757; Rigveda, Glossar, 161. considers that the word primarily means ‘knowledge,’ ‘wisdom,’ ‘priestly lore,’ then ‘sacrifice’ and ‘spiritual authority.’ Bloomfield, 8) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 12 et seq. on the other hand, insists that Vidatha refers to the ‘house’ 9) See Rigveda, x. 85, 26. 27 (of the wife in the marriage ritual); i. 117, 25; ii. 1, 6; Av. xviii. 3, 70. in the first place (from vid, ‘acquire’), and then to the ‘sacrifice,’ as connected with the house; this interpretation, at any rate, appears to suit all the passages. The term vidathya, once 10) iv. 27, 2. In i. 91, 20; 167, 3; Av. xx. 128, 1, vidathya, ‘having an establishment,’ seems adequate. applied to the king (samrāṭ), might seem to be against this view, but it may refer to his being ‘rich in homesteads’; and the connexion of the woman with the Vidatha, as opposed to the Sabhā, tells in favour 11) Cf. Av. vii. 38, 4; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 7, 4. of Bloomfield's explanation. That the word ever denotes an asylum, like the house of the Brahmin, 12) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 1, 13, with Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 3, 35. as Ludwig 13) Op. cit., 3, 261. suggests, is doubtful. 14) Rv. i. 31, 6; v. 62, 6; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 30, 27, 28, certainly does not show this clearly. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 177, who suggests that Vidatha sometimes means (e.g., in vidatheṣu praśastaḥ, Rv. ii. 27, 12) a smaller assembly than the Samiti. But we have no ground to be certain that such smaller assemblies ever existed at an early date either in India or elsewhere among Āryan peoples.

vidanvantbhaargava|विदन्वन्त्भार्गव
विदन्वन्त् भार्गव<BR> (‘descendant of Bhṛgu’) is mentioned as the seer of a Sāman or chant in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 11, 10. and in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 2) iii. 159 et seq. (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 64).

vidarbha|विदर्भ
विदर्भ<BR> occurs in the earlier Vedic literature as the name of a place only in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, 1) ii. 440 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 103, n. 3). where its Mācalas (perhaps a species of dog) are said to kill tigers.

vidarbhiikauNDineya|विदर्भीकौण्डिनेय
विदर्भी-कौण्डिनेय<BR> is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Vatsanapāt in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 (Mādhyaṃdina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Kāṇva)

vidish|विदिश्
वि-दिश्<BR> denotes 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vi. 19; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iv. 4. an ‘intermediate quarter.’ See Diś.

vidiigaya|विदीगय
विदीगय<BR> is the name of an animal in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) v. 6, 22, 1. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 2) iii. 9, 9, 3; Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, xx. 22, 13. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94. The commentary on the former takes it as a kind of cock (kukkuṭa-viśeṣa), that on the latter as a white heron (śveta-baka). 

videgha|विदेघ
विदेघ<BR> is the name of a man, Māthava, in the Śatapatha Brāhmana. 1) i. 4, 1, 10 et seq. It is legitimate to assume 2) Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xli, n. 4; 104, n.; Weber Indische Studien, 1, 170; Indische Streifen, 1, 13; Indian Literature, 134. that it is a name given to him as king of the Videghas who are the later Videhas.

videha|विदेह
विदेह<BR> is the name of a people who are not mentioned before the Brāhmaṇa period. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) i. 4, 1, 10 et seq. the legend of Videgha Māthava preserves clearly a tradition that in Videha culture came from the Brahmins of the West, and that Kosala was brahminized before Videha. The Videhas, however, derived some fame later from the culture of their king Janaka, who figures in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2) iii. 8, 2. Cf. iv. 2, 6; 9, 30; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 3, 1, 2; 6, 2, 1; 3, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 9, 9. as one of the leading patrons of the Brahman doctrine. In the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 3) iv. 1. the Videhas are joined with the Kāśis; in the list of peoples in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 4) viii. 14. the Videhas are passed over, probably because, with Kosala and Kāśi, they are included in the term Prācyas, ‘easterners.’ Again, in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 5) xvi. 29. 5. it is recorded that the Kāśi, Kosala, and Videha kingdoms had each the one Purohita, Jala Jātūkarṇya; and in another passage of the same text 6) xvi. 9, 11. 13. the connexion between the Videha king, Para Āṭṇāra, and the Kosala king, Hiraṇyanābha, is explained, while the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 7) xiii. 5, 4, 4. speaks of Para Āṭṇāra as the Kosala king, descendant of Hiraṇyanābha. Another king of Videha was Namī Sāpya, mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 8) xxv. 10, 17. In the Saṃhitās of the Yajurveda 9) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 4, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiv. 5. ‘cows of Videha’ seem to be alluded to, though the commentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā merely takes the adjective vaidehī as ‘having a splendid body’ (viśiṣṭa-deha-sambandhinī), and the point of a place name in the expression is not very obvious. The Videhas also occur in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 10) ii. 5; xxi. 13. in Brāhmaṇa-like passages. The boundary of Kosala and Videha was the Sadānīrā, probably the modern Gandak 11) Cf. Imperial Gaxetteer of India, 12, 125. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 170; Indian Literature, 10, 33, 53, 127, 129, etc.; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xli; Oldenberg, Buddha, 398, 399; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 26, 37; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 19 et seq. (the Kondochates of the Greek geographers), which, rising in Nepal, flows into the Ganges opposite Patna. Videha itself corresponds roughly to the modern Tirhut.

vidyaa|विद्या
विद्या<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 116, 1; xi. 7, 10; 8, 3. and later 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 2, 8; v. 1, 7, 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 23, 8. 9, etc. denotes ‘knowledge,’ especially that of the three Vedas, which are called the trayī vidyā, ‘the threefold knowledge,’ as early as the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 3) iii. 10, 11, 5. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 5, 6, etc. In a more special sense Vidyā occurs in lists of objects of study in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 4) xi. 5, 6, 8; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 4, 10; iv. 5, 11. What exactly the expression here means is uncertain: Sāyaṇa 5) On Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 6, 8. suggests the philosophic systems; Geldner 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 290, n. 4. the first Brāhmaṇas; and Eggeling, 7) Sacred Books of the East, 44, 98, n. 2. more probably, special sciences like the Sarpavidyā or the Viṣavidyā.

vidradha|विद्रध
विद्रध<BR> denotes a disease, ‘abscesses,’ in the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 127, 1; ix. 8, 20. According to Zimmer, 2) Altindisches Leben, 386. it was a symptom accompanying Yakṣma. Later it is called Vidradhi. Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 93. Cf. Roth, Nirukta, Erläuterungen, 42, 43. compares the obscure Vidradha of the Rigveda, 4) iv. 32, 23. where, however, the sense of the word is very uncertain. 5) Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 295. Cf. Wise, System of Hindu Medicine, 210; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 531, 602; Atharvaveda, 60; Grohmann, Indische Studien, 9, 397; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 376.

vidhavaa|विधवा
विधवा<BR> denotes ‘widow’ as the ‘desolate one,’ from the root vidh, ‘be bereft.’ The masculine vidhava is conjectured by Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; so also Grassmann. in a difficult passage of the Rigveda, 2) x. 40, 8. where the received text presents the apparent false concord vidhantaṃ vidhavām, in which he sees a metrical lengthening for vidhavam, ‘the sacrificing widower.’ Ludwig in his version takes vidhantam as equivalent to a feminine, while Delbrück 3) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 443. prefers ‘the worshipper and the widow.’ Possibly ‘the widower and the widow’ may be meant; but we know nothing of the mythological allusion in question, the feat being one of those attributed to the Aśvins, and the natural reference to Ghoṣā as ‘husbandless’ being rendered unlikely because their feat in regard to her has already been mentioned a few verses before in the same hymn. 4) x. 40. 5. The word Vidhavā is not of common occurrence. 5) Rv. iv. 18, 12; x. 40, 2; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7; Nirukta, iii. 15.

vidhu|विधु
विधु<BR> seems clearly to mean (as it does in the post-Vedic language) the ‘moon’ in a passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 55, 5; Nirukta, xiv. 18. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 465. That the ‘many’ are the Nakṣatras is neither certain nor even probable. The stars are an adequate explanation. where it is alluded to as ‘wandering solitary in the midst of many’ (vidhuṃ dadrāṇaṃ samane bahūnām).

vinashana|विनशन
वि-नशन,<BR> ‘disappearance,’ is the name of the place where the Sarasvatī is lost in the sands of the desert. It is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) xxv. 10, 6; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxiv. 5, 30; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 15, 1; Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra, i. 1, 2, 12. Cf. Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, 14, 2, 147. and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 2) iv. 26. The locality is the Patiala district of the Panjab. 3) Cf. Imperial Gazetteer of India, 22, 97. Cf. Plakṣa Prāsravaṇa.

vip|विप्
विप्<BR> in several passages of the Rigveda 1) ix. 3, 2; 65, 12; 99, 1. refers, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. to the rods which form the bottom of the Soma filter, and on which the straining cloth is stretched. But this explanation is very doubtful. 3) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 203; Bergaigne, Religion Vedique, 1, v; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellchaft, 54, 171; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 97-110.

vipatha|विपथ
वि-पथ,<BR> in the description of the Vrātya, 1) Av. xv. 2, 1; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 1, 14; Lāṭyāyana Srauta Sūtra, viii. 6, 9; Anupada Sūtra, v. 4; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxii. 4, 11; Āpastamba Srauta Sūtra, xxii. 5, 5; cf. vii. 3, 8. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 44. denotes a vehicle suited for rough roads. Cf. Anas.

vipashchitdRDhajayantalauhitya|विपश्चित्दृढजयन्तलौहित्य
1. Vipaścit Dṛḍha-jayanta Lauhitya (‘descendant of Lohita’) is mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 42, 1) as the pupil of Dakṣa Jayanta Lauhitya.

vipashchitshakunimitrapaaraasharya|विपश्चित्शकुनिमित्रपाराशर्य
2. Vipaścit Śakuni-mitra Pārāśarya (‘descendant of Parāśara’) is the name of a teacher, pupil of Aṣāḍha Uttara Pārāśarya, in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmana (iii. 41, 1).

vipaash|विपाश्
वि-पाश्<BR> (‘fetterless’) is the name of a river mentioned twice in the Rigveda. 1) iii. 33, 1. 3; iv. 30, 11. Yāska, Nirukta, xi. 48, sees in the latter passage an adjective vi-pāśin, but this is very improbable. See Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 294. It is the modern Beās in the Panjab, the Hyphasis, Hypanis or Bipasis of the Greeks. Its small importance for the Vedic Indians is indicated by the fact that it is never mentioned in the earlier Vedic literature except in two hymns of the Rigveda. The Nirukta 2) ix. 26. The Vipāś is also mentioned in connexion with the Śutudrī in ii. 24; ix. 36. preserves the notice that its earlier name was Uruñjirā, while the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa 3) i. 2, 7. places in the middle of it the Vasiṣṭha-śilāḥ. Pāṇinī 4) iv. 2, 74. mentions the name, which otherwise in post-Vedic literature appears as Vipāśā. This river has changed its course considerably since ancient times. 5) See Imperiat Gazctteer of India, 7, 138 (Beās). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 11. 

vipuujanashauraaki|विपूजनशौराकि
वि-पूजन शौराकि<BR> 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 3. or Saurāki 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvii. 5. is the name of a teacher in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.

vipRthu|विपृथु
विपृथु<BR> in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xiv. 72, 3) is apparently equivalent to the Vipatha, ‘rough cart,’ of other texts. It is probably a mere blunder.

vipra|विप्र
विप्र<BR> seems to mean ‘inspired singer’ (from vip, ‘quiver’) in the Rigveda 1) i. 129, 2. 11; 162, 7; iv. 26, 1, etc. Seven are spoken of in iii. 7, 7; 31. 5; iv. 2, 15, etc. and later. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 9, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ix. 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 2, 7, etc. More especially in the later texts 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 3, 12, etc. it denotes a ‘learned Brahmin.’ In the epic style it comes to mean no more than ‘Brahmin.’

viprachitti|विप्रचित्ति
विप्र-चित्ति<BR> 1) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Kāṇva or Vipra-jitti 2) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 Mādhyaṃdina. is the name of a teacher in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.

viprajanasauraaki|विप्रजनसौराकि
विप्र-जन सौराकि<BR> is the form of the name of Vipūjana given by the St. Petersburg Dictionaries for the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 1) xxvii. 5; Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 477, gives this form, which is due to a misreading of the ligature for ū.

vibaalii|विबाली
विबाली<BR> is found once in the Rigveda, 1) iv. 30, 12. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 12, 18. apparently as the name of an unknown stream.

vibhaNDakakaashyapa|विभण्डककाश्यप
विभण्डक काश्यप<BR> (‘descendant of Kaśyapa’) is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studīen, 4, 374. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Vibhāṇḍaka, which is the more correct spelling (Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v.). 

vibhindu|विभिन्दु
वि-भिन्दु<BR> is the name of a sacrificer in the Rigveda (viii. 2, 91). Cf. Hopkins. Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 59.

vibhinduka|विभिन्दुक
विभिन्दुक<BR> occurs in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) xv. 10, 11. as the name of a man or a demon 2) Cf. Sāyaṇa, a.l. from whom Medhātithi drove away the cows. Hopkins 3) Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 60, n. 1. is inclined to read Vaibhinduka as a patronymic of Medhātithi. Cf. Vibhindukīya.

vibhindukiiya|विभिन्दुकीय
विभिन्दुकीय<BR> is the name of a group of priests whose Sattra is mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 1) iii. 233 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 38).

vibhiitaka|विभीतक
विभीतक<BR> 1) This form is the regular one after the Rigveda. and Vibhīdaka, 2) Rv. vii. 86, 6; x. 34, 1. the latter being the old form, denote a large tree, the Terminalia bellerica, the nut of which was used in dicing. 3) Rv., loc. cit. See 2. Akṣa. The wood was also used for making the 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 5, 8; 7, 3. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 8, 1, 16, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62; Roth, Gurupūjākaumudī, 1-4; Lüders, Das Wūrfelspiel im alten Indien, 17-19. sacrificial fire burn.

vimada|विमद
1. Vi-mada is credited by the Anukramaṇī (Index) with the authorship of a number of hymns of the Rigveda. 1) Rv. x. 20-26. This attribution is supported by the occurrence in this group of the name of the seer, 2) Rv. x. 20, 10; 23, 7. and once of his family, the Vimadas, 3) Rv. x. 23, 6. besides the repeated refrain 4) Rv. x. 21, 1-8; 24, 1-3. vi vo made, ‘in your carouses.’ Vimada is occasionally alluded to later. 5) Av. iv. 29, 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 1. 

vimada|विमद
2. Vimada is mentioned in several passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 51, 3; 112, 19; 116, 1; 117, 20; x. 39, 7; 65, 12, From viii. 9, 15, Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 105, has inferred that Vimada and Vatsa were identical. as a protégé of the Aśvins, who gave him a wife, Kamadyū. His identity with the preceding is improbable.

vimuktaa|विमुक्ता
वि-मुक्ता<BR> (lit., ‘secreted’), ‘pearl,’ is found in the late Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (v. 6).

vimoktR|विमोक्तृ
वि-मोक्तृ<BR> in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 14; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 10, 1 (cf. vimoktrī,) used metaphorically, ibid., iii. 7. 14, 1). (‘human sacrifice’) denotes one who unharnesses horses from the chariot, as opposed to Yoktṛ, ‘one who yokes.’ The corresponding verbal noun Vimocana, ‘unyoking,’ is often found. 2) Rv. iii. 53, 5, 20; iv. 46, 7, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 1, 5, etc.

viraaj|विराज्
वि-राज्<BR> as a title of royalty is mentioned several times in the Rigveda, 1) i. 188, 5; ix. 96, 18; x. 166, 1, etc.; Av. xii. 3, 11; xiv. 2, 15, etc. but only in a metaphorical sense. As an actual title, it is asserted in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 2) viii. 14, 3. to be used by the Uttara Kurus and the Uttara Madras.

viruupa|विरूप
वि-रूप<BR> is the name of an Aṅgirasa who is twice mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) i. 45, 3; viii. 75, 6. and to whom certain hymns are attributed by the Anukramaṇī (Index). ^2 viii. 43 et seq.; 64.

वि-लोहित<BR> is the name of a disease mentioned in the Atharvaveda. 1) ix. 8, 1; xii. 4, 4 Bloomfield 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 657. thinks that ‘flow of blood from the nose’ is meant; Henry 3) Les livres viii. et ix. de l' Atharvaveda, 105, 142. renders it ‘decomposition of the blood’; and Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda 549. has ‘anæmia.’

vivadha|विवध
वि-वध<BR> or Vī-vadha seems to denote a yoke borne on the shoulders to enable one to carry a weight. But it is found in the Brāhmaṇas used only metaphorically in such phrases as vi-vivadha, 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 2, 5, 2; 7, 3; vivīvadha, Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5, 19; ubhayato -vīvadha, Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvii. 10. ‘with the weight unequally distributed,’ and savīvadhatā, 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 1, 4; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1, 10; sa-vīvadha-tva, v. 1, 11: xxii. 5, 7, etc. ‘equality of burden.’

vivayana|विवयन
वि-वयन<BR> denotes in the Brāhmaṇas ‘plaited work,’ such as that used in a couch (Asandī). ^1 Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇā, xii. 8, 3, 6. In the Sūtras vivāna has the same sense; Lāṭyāyana Srauta Sūtra, iii, 12, 1, etc.

vish|विश्
विश्<BR> is an expression of somewhat doubtful significance. In many passages of the Rigveda 1) iv. 4, 3; 37, 1; v. 3. 5; vi. 21, 4; 48, 8; vii. 56, 22; 61, 3, 70, 3; 104, 18; x. 91, 2, etc. the sense of ‘settlement’ or ‘dwelling’ is adequate and probable, since the root viś means to ‘enter’ or ‘settle.’ In other passages, where the Viśaḥ stand in relation to a prince, the term must mean ‘subject’; 2) Rv. iv. 50, 8; vi. 8, 4; x. 124, 8; 173, 6; Av. iii. 4, 1; iv. 8, 4; 22, 1. 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 8, 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, viii. 46; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 2. 17; iv. 2, 1, 3; v. 3, 3, 12; 4, 2, 3; x. 6, 2, 1; xiii. 6, 2, 8; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv, 12, etc. Many of the passages cited under note 11 may also belong here, while in Av. iii. 4, 1, etc., reference to the cantons as electing a king has been seen; but see Rājan and cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 179; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 303; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 113. so, for example, when the people of Tṛṇaskanda 3) Rv. i. 172, 3. or of the Tṛtsus are mentioned. 4) Rv. vii. 33, 6; Geldner, op. cit., 136. Again, in some passages 5) E.g., Rv. vi. 1, 8; 26, 1; viii. 71, 11; manuṣo viśāḥ, vi. 14, 2; viii. 23, 13; mānuṣīḥ, x. 80, 6, etc. the general sense of ‘people’ is adequate; as when the Rigveda speaks of the ‘Āryan people,’ 6) Rv. x. 11, 4. or the ‘divine people,’ 7) Rv. iii. 34, 2; Av. vi. 98, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvii. 86. or the ‘Dāsa people,’ and so on. 8) Rv. iv. 28, 4; vi. 25, 2; adevīḥ, viii. 96, 15; asiknīḥ, vii. 5, 3, etc. Sometimes, 9) Rv. ii. 26, 3, where it is opposed to jana, janman, and putrāḥ; x. 84, 4, where in battle viśaṃ-viśam apparently refers to divisions of the host cf. also iv. 24, 4. viśo yudhmāḥ); x. 91, 2, where it is opposed to gṛha and jana; Av. xiv. 2, 27, where gṛhebhyaḥ is followed by asyai sarvasyai viśe, which must mean a division less than a whole people. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 159, reckons here Rv. i. 172, 3; vii. 33, 6; ix. 7, 5; x. 124, 8; 173, 1; but these cases and many others are rather instances of ‘subjects’ than of a division of the tribe such as ‘canton.’ however, the Viś appear in a more special sense as a subdivision of the Jana or whole people. This is, however, not common, for in most passages one or other of the senses given above is quite possible. Moreover, it is very difficult to decide whether the Viś as a subdivision of the Jana is to be considered as being a local subdivision (canton) or a blood kinship equivalent to a clan in the large sense of the word, while the relation of the Viś to the Grāma or to the Gotra is quite uncertain. In one passage of the Atharvaveda 10) xv. 8, 2, 3, Cf. xiv. 2, 27, and Rv. x. 91, 2, in n. 9. the Viśaḥ are mentioned along with the sabandhavaḥ or relatives, but no definite conclusion can be drawn from that fact. Nor does the analogy of the Roman curia or the Greek  throw much light, as these institutions are themselves of obscure character, and the parallelism need not be cogent. It is, at any rate, possible that the Viś may in some cases have been no more than a Gotra or clan, or different clans may sometirnes have made up a Viś, while Grāma is more definitely, perhaps, a local designation. But the Vedic evidence is quite inconclusive. 11) The Viś may have been oringinally a clan settled in one place: there is no passage where ‘Gotra’ would not probably make sense; Rv. ii. 26, 3, cannot be pressed unduly to distinguish ianman and Viś. Compare the phrase used of the Maruts śardhaṃ śardham, vrātaṃ vrātam, gaṇaṃ gaṇam, in Rv. v. 53. 11, where no precise sense can fairly be attributed to the words, though Zimmer sees in them a threefold division of the host corresponding to Jana, Viś, and Grāma. The rendering ‘Gau’ has therefore little foundation. Cf. Viśpati. In the later period the sense of Viś is definitely restricted in some cases 12) Perhaps to this sense belong the numerous passages in the Brāhmaṇas and later Saṃhitās referring to strife between the Viś and the Kṣatra, the clansmen and the chiefs, or the peasantry and the nobles--e.g., Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 11, 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii, 1, 9; iii. 3, 10; Kāṭhaka Saṃhita, xix. 9 and often. See also Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 10, 9; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 3, 5; viii. 7, 2, 3; xiii. 2, 2, 17. 19; 9, 6; xiv. 1, 3, 27, etc.; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 14. Cf. Zimmer, Ātindisches Leben, 15 et seq.; Schrader. Prehistoric Autiquities, 800 et seq.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 158; von Schroeder, Indiens Literalur und Cultur, 32, 33; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

Mommsen, History of Rome, 1, 72, et seq.; Römische Forschungen, 1. 140-150; Römisches Staatsrecht, 3, 9; Taylor, History of Rome. 11, 12; Smith, Dictionary of Antiquities, 1, 576; Cuq, Les institutions juridiques des Romains, 30-36, For the Greek Phratria which was probably similar in character, consisting of a union of  see Dictionary of Antiquities, 2, 876 et seq.; Greenidge, Greek Constitutional History, 128 et seq.; Bury, History of Greece, 69, 70; Gilbert, Greek Constitutional Antiquities, 1, 104 et seq., 210. For the English hundreds, and the supposed analogy of the pagi of Tacitus, see the references in Medley, English Constitutional History,^2 318 et seq. to denote the third of the classes of the Vedic polity, the people or clansmen as opposed to the nobles (Kṣatra, Kṣatriya) and the priests (Brahman, Brāhmaṇa). For the position of this class, see Vaiśva.

vishara|विशर
वि-शर<BR> is found as the name of a disease, perhaps ‘tearing pains,’ in the Atharvaveda. 1) ii. 4, 2. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben. 391. thinks that the pains in the limbs attendant on fever (Takman) are alluded to. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. sees in the word the name of a demon. The view of Zimmer is supported by the use of viśarīka, ‘rending,’ beside Balāsa in another passage. 4) xix. 34, 10. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymas of the Athervaveda, 284. 

vishaakhe|विशाखे
वि-शाखे<BR> See Nakṣatra

vishpati|विश्पति
विश्-पति<BR> is a word of somewhat uncertain signification, reflecting in this respect the nature of Viś. Zimmer holds that in its strict sense it denotes the head of a canton, but he admits that there is no passage requiring this sense, the only one quoted by him 2) Rv. i. 37. 8. being certainly indecisive. In the great majority of passages the word simply means the ‘lord of the dwelling,’ whether used of a man or of the god Agni as the householder par excellence, or possibly as the fire of the Sabhā or assembly house of the people. This sense suits even the passage of the Rigveda 4) vii. 55, 5 = Av. iv. 5, 6. in which the Viśpati, as well as the father and the mother of a maiden, 5) So Aufrecht, Indische Studien, 4, 337 et seq.; Zimmer, op. cit., 308. Cf. Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 370. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 55 et seq., accepts the view of the Bṛhaddevatā, vi. 11 et seq. (where see Macdonell's note), that the hymn refers to Vasiṣṭha's approaching a house as a thief! The interpretation does not affect the sense of Viśpati, which here is clearly not the title of a cantonal chief. Viś is sometimes equivalent to Sajāta; cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 3, 2. 3. are to be lulled to sleep in order to allow her lover to approach her, for the household may well be deemed to have been a joint family, in which the Viśpati could easily be different from the father of the girl--e.g., a grandfather or uncle. In other passages 6) Av. iii. 4, 1; iv. 22, 3. Perhaps Rv. iii. 13, 5, is so to be taken; cf. vii. 39, 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 22. the Viśpati is the king as ‘lord of the subject-people’ (viśām), though here Zimmer 7) Op. cit., 164, 165. thinks reference is made to the election of a king. 8) But see Rājan. Or again, 7) Op. cit., 164. 165. the Viśpati is the chief of the Viś, probably in the sense of ‘subjects.’ 1) Altindisches Leben, 171. 9) E.g., Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 1, 3, where Viś must clearly be the people or subject class, and the Viśpati their chief representative; we cannot from such a passage infer a formal office of Viśpati even as head of the Viś.

vishpalaa|विश्पला
विश्पला<BR> is, according to the tradition in the Rigveda, 1) i. 112, 10: 116 15; 11. 11: 118. 8; x. 39, 8. the name of a woman to whom the Aśvins gave an iron (āyasī) limb to replace one lost by her in a contest. Pischel 2) Vedische Studien, 1. 171-173. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 52; Muir, Saniskrit Texts, 5, 245; Bloomfield, Religion of the Veda, 113; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 110, 111. considers that a racing horse miraculously cured of a broken limb by the Aśvins is meant, but this is no more than an improbable conjecture.

vishvaka|विश्वक
विश्वक,<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 116, 23; 117. 7; viii. 86, 1; x. 65, 12. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 52. called Kṛṣṇiya (possibly ‘son of Kṛṣṇa’) is a protégé of the Aśvins, who restored to him his lost son, Viṣṇāpu. See 2. Kṛṣṇa.

vishvakarmanbhauvana|विश्वकर्मन्भौवन
विश्व-कर्मन् भौवन<BR> (‘descendant of Bhuvana’) is the name of a quite mythical king. He is said in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa to have been consecrated by Kaśyapa, to whom he offered the earth (i.e., presumably a piece of land) as a sacrificial fee; in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) xiii. 7, 1, 15. he performed the Sarvamedha (‘universal sacrifice’), and made a similar offer; in both cases the earth refused to be given. The story seems to contain a reference to the early dislike of gifts of land, 3) Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 47. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 421, n, 1; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 456, 457. but it cannot be stated with certainty that this is the meaning. ^1 viii. 21, 8.

vishvantarasauShadmana|विश्वन्तरसौषद्मन
विश्वन्-तर सौ-षद्मन<BR> (‘descendant of Suṣadman’) is the name in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) vii. 27, 3, 4; 34, 7, 8. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 431-440; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 344, n. of a prince who set aside the Śyāparṇas, his priests, and performed a sacrifice without their help, presumably with the aid of others. Rāma Mārgaveya, one of the Śyāparṇas, however, succeeded in inducing the king to reinstate the Śyāparṇas, and to give him a thousand cows.

vishvamanas|विश्वमनस्
विश्व-मनस्<BR> is the name of a Ṛṣi mentioned in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 23, 2; 24, 7. and as a frined of Indra in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 2) xv. 5, 20. According to the Anukramaṇī (Index), he was a descendant of Vyaśva, and the author of certain hymns. 3) Rv. viii. 23-26. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 106.

vishvamaanuSha|विश्वमानुष
विश्व-मानुष<BR> in one passage of the Rigveda 1) viii. 45, 22. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 187. may be a proper name, but more probably merely means ‘all mankind.’

vishvavaara|विश्ववार
विश्व-वार<BR> occurs in one passage of the Rigveda 1) v. 44, 11. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138. apparently as the name of a sacrificer.

vishvaasaaman|विश्वासामन्
विश्वा-सामन्<BR> is the name of a Ṛṣi, an Atreya, in the Rigveda. 1) v. 22, 1. Cf. Oldenberg. Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 215.

vishvasRj|विश्वसृज्
विश्व-सृज्<BR> is the name of certain mythical beings to whom, however, a Sattra, or sacrificial session, is ascribed in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xxv. 18, 1 et seq.).

vishvaamitra|विश्वामित्र
विश्वा-मित्र<BR> (‘friend of all’) is the name of a Ṛṣi who is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) As son of Kuśika in Rv. iii. 33, 5; as Viśvāmitra in iii. 53, 7, 12. and to whom the third Maṇḍala is attributed by tradition. In one hymn 2) iii. 33. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 121, thinks the hymn too poetical to be a real composition of the reputed author. which appears to be his own composition, he praises the rivers Vipāś (Beas) and Śutudrī (Sutlej). There he calls himself the son of Kuśika, and seems unquestionably to be the helper of the Bharatas, whom he mentions. The tribe, engaged in a raid, apparently came to the rivers from the east. 4) So Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 152. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 127, 128, takes a different view: with Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 90, he assumes that the Bharatas were different from the Tṛtsus, and that they came under Viśvāmitra from the West, but were defeated (see Rv. vii. 33, 6). But see Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 34, n. 1; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 136. Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 41, 42, still defends Roth's view. Anxious to cross them, they ^3 Rv. iii. 33, 5. found them in high flood, but Viśvāmitra by prayer induced the waters to subside. The same feat appears to be referred to in another passage of the same book of the Rigveda. 5) iii. 53, 9-11. This hymn is probably later. Curiously enough, Sāyaṇa 6) Sāyaṇa on Rv. iii. 33. quite misunderstands the situation: according to him, Viśvāmitra having obtained wealth by the exercise of his office, went off with it to the rivers, pursued by others. Yāska's 7) Nirukta, ii. 24. version of the tale merely seems to mean that the king paid Viśvāmitra to act as his Purohita, or domestic priest. For the relations of Viśvāmitra to Vasiṣṭha connected with their service of Sudās, see Vasiṣṭha. The Viśvāmitras are mentioned in several other passages of the Rigveda, 8) iii. 1, 21; 18, 4; 53, 13; x. 89, 17; Av. xviii. 3, 6; 4, 54; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 15, 1. and are also designated as a family by the term Kuśikas. 9) Rv. iii. 26, 1. 3; 29, 15; 30, 20; 42, 9; 53, 9. 10. In the later literature Viśvāmitra becomes, like Vasiṣṭha, a mythical sage, usually 10) Cf. Rv. iii. 53, 15. 16; Ṣaḍguruśiṣya in Macdonell's edition of the Sarvānukramaṇī, p. 107; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 117; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 343; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 158 et seq. mentioned in connection with Jamadagni; he was Hotṛ priest at the sacrifice of Śunaḥśepa, whom he adopted, and to whom he gave the name of Devarāta. 11) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 16 et seq.; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 17 et seq. He was a protégé of Indra, with whom he had an interview according to the Rigveda Āraṇyakas. 12) Aitareya Āraṇyaka. ii. 2, 3; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, i. 5. He is also often mentioned as a Ṛṣi. 13) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 2, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 18, 1; 20, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 1, 2; iii. 1, 7, 3; v. 2, 3, 4, etc.; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvi. 19; xx. 9; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 7, 19; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xv. 1; xxvi. 14; xxviii. 1. 2; xxix. 3; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 3, 12; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 2, 4; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 13; 15, 1, etc. Jamadagni is often associated with him, Av. iv. 29, 5, etc. In the Epic 14) Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 388 et seq. Viśvāmitra is represented as a king, who becomes a Brahmin. There is no trace of his kingship in the Rigveda, but the Nirukta 15) ii. 24. calls his father, Kuśika, a king; the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 16) vii. 18, 9. But the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 27, has a completely different version, which Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 16, n. 3, prefers, and which omits all allusion to the ‘lordship’ of the Jahnus. This shows how little stress can-be laid on this latetradition. refers to Śunaḥśepa as succeeding to the lordship of the Jahnus, as well as the ‘divine lore’ (daiva veda) of the Gāthins; and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 17) xxi. 12, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 121; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 209, 210; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 337 et seq.; Weber, op. cit., 16 et seq.; Indian Literature, 31, 37, 38, 53, etc. mentions Viśvāmitra as a king. But there is no real-trace of this kingship of Viśvāmitra: it may probably be dismissed as a mere legend, with no more foundation at most than that Viśvāmitra was of a family which once had been royal. But even this is doubtful.

viSha|विष
विष<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 117, 16; 191, 11; vi. 61, 3; x. 87. 18, etc. and later 2) Av. iv. 6, 2; v. 19, 10; vi. 90, 2, etc. regularly denotes ‘poison’ as an antidote, for which the Atharvaveda supplies spells. 3) Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 61.

viShavidyaa|विषविद्या
विष-विद्या,<BR> the ‘science of poison,’ is enumerated with other sciences in the Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra (x. 75). Cf. Vidyā.

viShaaNaa|विषाणा
विषाणा<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 7, 1. 2; vi. 121, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 11, 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 3, 2, 17. Primarily a deciduous horn is meant. See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 94. and later^2 denotes an animal's ‘horn.’

viShaaNakaa|विषाणका
विषाणका<BR> is the name of a plant in the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 44, 3. Cf. Viṣāṇikā in Wise, Hindu System of Medicine, 146, perhaps the Asclepias geminata; Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 12, 426; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 68. But cf. Whitney. Translation of the Atharvaveda, 313. Bloomfield, 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 482. however, thinks that the word may merely mean ‘horn.’ It is used as a remedy against the disease Vātīkāra. 3) Av. ix. 8, 20; Vātī-kṛta, vi. 44, 3; 109, 3. That disease is of doubtful character: Zimmer 4) Op. cit., 389. 390. thinks that it is one ‘caused by wounds,’ comparing the adjective a-vāta, ‘uninjured,’ in the Rigveda, 5) vi. 16, 20; ix. 96, 8. but Bloomfield 6) Op. cit., 481 et seq., 516. shows that ‘wind’ in the body is meant as causing the disease.

viShaaNin|विषाणिन्
विषाणिन्<BR> occurs once in the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 7. as the name of a tribe in the list of the enemies of the Tṛtsus, not as Roth 2) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 95; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 126. But Zimmer, op. cit., 430, 431, altered his view, and Hopkins' criticism, overlooking this retractation, in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 260, 261, is so far unjustified. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173. thought, of their allies. The word seems to mean ‘having horns,’ but in what sense is unknown; perhaps their helmets were horn-shaped or ornamented with horns. They may, like their allies, the Alinas, Bhalānas, Śivas, and Pakthas, be reckoned as belonging to the tribes of the north-west.

viShuuvant|viShuuvat|विषूवत्|विषूवन्त्
1. Viṣūvant denotes in the Atharvaveda 1) xi. 7, 15. and later 2) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5, 2; 7, 1; v. 9, 10; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 41, 4; iv. 18, 1; 22, 1. 2; vi. 18, 8; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 1; xxvi. 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 3, 2; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 1, 2, 2; 3, 14. 23; 4, 2; 2, 1, 8, etc. the middle day in the Sattra or sacrificial session of a year's duration. Tilak 3) Orion, 21, 22. argues that the Viṣūvant literally means the day when night and daylight are equal--i.e., the equinoctial day--and that this is the true sense of the word. But the theory is without probability. ^4 Cf. Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, ixxxiii. et seq.

viShuuvant|viShuuvat|विषूवत्|विषूवन्त्
2. Viṣūvant occurs in the description of the house in the Atharvaveda. 1) ix. 3, 8. The meaning seems to be tha ‘ridge of the roof.’ 2) Cf. Zimmer. Altindisches Leben, 151 (who thinks it is a metaphor from the parting of the hair); Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 598; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 526. 

viShuuchikaa|विषूचिका
विषूचिका<BR> is the name of a disease mentioned in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 1) xix. 10 = Maitrāyaḥī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 7 = Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 18 = Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 1, 5 = Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 7, 3, 2. as a result of over-indulgence in Soma drinking. It seems clearly to be ‘dyser ery,’ or, as Wise calls it, ‘sporadic cholera.’ The term apparently means ‘causing evacuations in both directions.’ 2) Hindu System of Medicine, 330. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 275, 392.

viShkandha|विष्कन्ध
वि-ष्कन्ध<BR> occurs severai times in the Atharvaveda 1) i. 16, 3; ii. 4, 1 et seq.; iii. 9, 2. 6; iv. 9, 5; xix. 34, 5. It is also found in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 3, 11, 1. as the name of a disease. As rem dies against it a lead amulet, 2) Av. i. 16, 3. Cf. ii. 4; iii. 9, 6. or hemp, 3) Av. ii. 4, 5. or a salve, 4) Av. iv. 9, 5. or the Ja giḍa plant are recommended for use. 5) Av. ii. 4, 1. 5; xix. 34. 5; 35, 1. Weber 6) Indische Studien, 4, 410; 13, 141; 17, 215. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 390, 391; Grill, Hundert Lieder,^2 75. suggests that the disease meant is ‘rheumatism,’ because it draws the shoulders apart (vi-skandha), but Bloomfield 7) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 282, 283. thinks that it is rather the name of a demon, like the Rigvedic Vyaṃśa 8) Rv. i. 32, 5, etc. and Vigrīva, 9) Rv. viii. 4, 24. both of which are similarly formed and are names of demons. Possibly Karśapha and Viśapha mentioned in one hymn 10) Av. iii. 9, 1. Cf. Bloomfield, op. cit., 340. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., thinks demons are meant: this seems the more probable view. are plants used to cure the disease.

viShTaarin|विष्टारिन्
वि-ष्टारिन्<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) iv. 34, 1 et seq. According to Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 206, the designation ‘outspread’ is due to the fact that the rice mess was kneaded into furrows and juices (rasa) were poured into them. See Kauśika Sūtra, lxvi. 6. denotes a special sort of Odana or porridge.

viShThaavraajin|विष्ठाव्राजिन्
विष्ठा-व्राजिन्<BR> is a word of doubtful significance in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) v. 1, 12. According to Sāyaṇa, it means ‘remaining in one and the same place’; if this is right, the rendering of the St. Petersburg Dictionary and of Böhtlingk's Dictionary, ‘one whose herd is stationary,’ seems legitimate. But, as Eggeling 2) Sacred Books of the East, 41, 123, n. 1. points out, the Kāṇva recension of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa in another passage 3) Ibid., 50, n. 1. seems to treat the word as denoting a disease: thus Viṣṭhāvrājin may mean ‘one afflicted by dysentery.’

viShNaapu|विष्णापु
विष्णापु<BR> is the son of Viśvaka in the Rigveda. 1) i. 116, 23; 117, 7; viii. 86, 3; x. 65, 12. When lost he was restored to his father by the Aśvins.

viShphulinga|विष्फुलिङ्ग
विष्फुलिङ्ग<BR> denotes a ‘spark’ of fire in the Upaniṣads. 1) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii, 1, 23; vi. 1, 12; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iii. 3; iv. 20, etc. Cf. viṣpuliṅgaka, ‘scattering sparks of fire,’ in Rv. i. 191, 12 (Sāyaṇa, ‘a tongue of fire,’ or ‘sparrow’).

viShvaksena|विष्वक्सेन
विष्वक्-सेन<BR> is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Nārada, mentioned in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) at the end of the Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa.

visalya|विसल्य
विसल्य<BR> 1) ix. 8, 20. and Visalyaka 2) vi. 127, 1 et seq.; ix. 8, 2. 5; xix. 44, 2. are names of a disease in the Atharvaveda. Since Shaṅkar Paṇḍit's reciters 3) See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 601; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 376. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 378, 384. pronounced the word as Visalpaka in all the passages, that should probably be adopted as the right reading. 4) The commentator Sāyaṇa on vi. 127 reads visalpakaḥ, and on xix. 44, 2, visarpakaḥ. Some sort of pain is meant, perhaps ‘neuralgia,’ in connexion with fever.

visras|विस्रस्
वि-स्रस्<BR> denotes the ‘decay’ of old age, ‘decrepitude,’ ‘senility.’ 1) Av. xix. 34, 3, where Bohtlingk, Dictionary, s.v., suggests for visrasas the emendation visruhas (cf. Rv. vi. 7, 6); Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 20, 5; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 3, 7; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 20, 7; Kāthaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4. 

vihalha|विहल्ह
विहल्ह<BR> is found in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 16, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72. apparently as the name of a plant. The forms Vihaṃla and Vihahla occur as variants.

viiNaa|वीणा
वीणा<BR> in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 4, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 5; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 6, 8. and the Brāhmaṇas 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 4, 6; xiii. 1, 5, 1; śata-tantrī, ‘hundredstringed’ (like the Vāṇa), at the Mahāvrata rite, Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvii. 3, 1, etc.; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 42 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 235). denotes a ‘lute.’ A Vīṇā-vāda, ‘lute-player,’ is included in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda, 3) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 20; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 15, 1. and is also mentioned elsewhere. 4) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 4, 8; iv. 5, 9. The Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 5) iii. 2, 5; cf. Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, viii. 9. which states that the instrument was once covered with a hairy skin, enumerates its parts as Śiras, ‘head’ (i.e., neck); Udara, ‘cavity’; Ambhaṇa, ‘sounding board’; Tantra, ‘string’; and Vādana, ‘plectrum.’ In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 6) xiii. 4, 2, 8. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 356, n. 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 289; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 328; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 755. the Uttaramandrā is either a tune or a kind of lute. Cf. Vāṇa.

viiNaagaathin|वीणागाथिन्
वीणा-गाथिन्<BR> denotes ‘lute-player’ in the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 9, 14, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 1, 5, 1; 4, 2, 8. 11. 14; 3, 5. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa Vīṇāgaṇagin denotes the ‘leader of a band.’ 2) xiii. 4, 3, 3; 4, 2; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 1, 29.

viiNaavaada|वीणावाद
वीणा-वाद<BR> See Vīṇā.

viitahavya|वीतहव्य
वीत-हव्य<BR> is the name of a prince who is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) vi. 15, 2. 3. along with Bharadvāja, and as a contemporary of Sudās, 2) vii. 19, 3. though in both passages it is possible to understand the word as a mere adjective. In the Atharvaveda 3) vi. 137, 1. Vītahavya appears as connected with Jamadagni and Asita, but it is clear that the legend there has no value. It is possible, though not certain, that he was a king of the Sṛṇjayas. 4) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105. In the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 5, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxii. 3; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 16, 3. Ibid., ix. 1, 9, he is represented as being niruddha, apparently in ‘banishment’; but the scholiast explains him as not a king, but a Ṛṣi, which is quite possible. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 212; Buddha, 405. a Vītahavya Śrāyasa appears as a king: he may be identical with the Vītahavya of the Rigveda, or belong to the same line. Cf. Vaitahavya.

viira|वीर
वीर<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 18, 4; 114, 8; iv. 29, 2; v. 20, 4; 61, 5, etc. and later 2) Av. ii. 26, 4; iii. 5, 8, etc. denotes ‘man’ as the strong and heroic. Collectively in the singular 3) Rv. ii. 32, 4; iii. 4, 9; 36, 10; vii. 34, 20, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 8, 1, etc. the word denotes ‘male offspring,’ an object of great desire (cf. Putra) to the Vedic Indian. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 4) xix. 1, 4. Viz., the king's brother, his son, Purohita, Mahiṣī, Sūta, Grāmaṇī, Kṣattṛ, and Saṃgrahītṛ. See Ratnin. gives a list of eight Vīras of the king, constituting his supporters and entourage.

viiraNa|वीरण
वीरण<BR> is the form in the late Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (v. 2) of the name of the plant Vīriṇa.

viirahatyaa|वीरहत्या
वीर-हत्या,<BR> ‘murder of a man,’ is one of the crimes referred to in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka. 1) x. 40. The Vīra-han, ‘man-slayer,’ is often mentioned in the older texts. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 5, 2, 1; ii. 2, 5, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxi. 7; Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 9; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 8, 12; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 5; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xii. 6, 8; xvi. 1, 12, etc. Cf. Vaira. 

viiriNa|वीरिण
वीरिण<BR> in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xiii. 8, 1, 15. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70. denotes a kind of grass (Andropogon muricatus). See Vairiṇa.

viirudh|वीरुध्
वीरुध्<BR> means ‘plant’ in the Rigveda, 1) i. 67, 9; 141, 4; ii. 1, 14; 35, 8, etc. and later. 2) Av. i. 32, 3; 34, 1; ii. 7, 1; v. 4, 1; xix. 35, 4, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 57. As contrasted with Oṣadhi, it denotes the inferior order of plants, but it often has practically the same sense as Oṣadhi.

vRka|वृक
1. Vṛka, ‘wolf,’ is mentioned frequently in the Rigveda, 1) i. 42, 2; 105, 7; 116, 14; ii. 29, 6; vi. 51, 14; vii. 38, 7, etc. and also later. 2) Av. vii. 95, 2; xii. 1, 49; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 10; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iv. 34; xix. 10. 92, etc. It was an enemy of sheep 3) Rv. viii. 34, 3; urā-mathi, ‘worrying sheep,’ x. 66, 8. and of calves, 4) Av. xii. 4. 7. being dangerous even to men. 5) Rv. i. 105, 11, 18; ii. 29, 6. In Nirukta, v. 21, Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 16, sees the sense of ‘dog,’ which seems needless. Cf. Nirukta, Erlāuterungen, 67. Its colour is stated to be reddish (aruṇa). 6) Rv. i. 105, 18. The ‘she-wolf,’ Vṛkī, is also mentioned several times in the Rigveda. 7) i. 116, 16; 117, 17; 183, 4; vi. 51, 6; x. 127, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 81; Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 14.

vRka|वृक
2. Vṛka in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 117, 21; viii. 22, 6; Nirukta, v. 26. denotes ‘plough.’

vRkadvaras|वृकद्वरस्
वृक-द्वरस्<BR> is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) ii. 30, 4. which Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 153; Griffith; Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 297, n. interprets as referring to a battle against Vṛkadvaras, king of the Śaṇḍikas. But this is quite uncertain. Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gescllschaft, 48, 110. and Oldenberg 4) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 211. incline to read vṛkadhvaras. Hillebrandt 5) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 442. suggests Iranian connections, but without any clear reason. 

vRxa|वृक्ष
वृक्ष<BR> is the ordinary term for tree' in the Rigveda 1) i. 164, 20. 22; ii. 14, 2; 39, 1; iv. 20, 5; v. 78, 6, etc. and later. 2) Av. i. 14, 1; ii. 12, 3; vi. 45, 1; xii. 1, 27, 51, etc. In the Atharvaveda 3) Av. xviii. 2, 25. Cf. Bṛhaddevatā, v. 83, with Macdonell's note (d). it denotes the coffin made from a tree, no doubt by hollowing it out. The Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 4) Indische Studien, 1, 40, and cf. Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 214. refers to the portent of a tree secreting blood.

vRxasarpii|वृक्षसर्पी
वृक्ष-सर्पी,<BR> ‘tree-creeper,’ is the name of a species of worm or female serpent in the Atharvaveda. 1) ix. 2, 22. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

vRxya|वृक्ष्य
वृक्ष्य<BR> in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (i. 1, 1, 10) denotes the ‘fruit of a tree.’

vRchayaa|वृचया
वृचया<BR> is referred to once in the Rigveda 1) i. 51, 3. Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 3, 203, who distinguishes two Kakṣīvants, but without sufficient reason, since i. 116, 17, must clearly refer to Vṛcayā. as the spouse given by the Aśvins to Kakṣīvant.

vRchiivant|vRchiivat|वृचीवत्|वृचीवन्त्
वृचीवन्त्<BR> is the name of a tribe referred to once in the Rigveda, 1) vi. 27, 5 et seq. where it is clearly stated that the Sṛñjaya king, Daivavāta, conquered the Turvaśa king and the Vṛcīvants. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 124. thinks that the Vṛcīvants and the Turvaśa people should be identified, but this is both unnecessary and improbable; it is adequate to assume that they were allied against 3) Oldenberg, Buddha, 404; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 153: Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105. the Sṛñjayas. The Vṛcīvants appear again only in the strange legend in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 4) xxi. 12, 2. according to which the Jahnus and the Vṛcīvants contended for sovereignty, Viśvāmitra, the Jahnu king, winning it by his knowledge of a certain rite. See also Hariyūpīyā. 

vRjana|वृजन
वृजन,<BR> according to Roth, 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2. denotes in several passages of the Rigveda 2) i. 51, 15, 73, 2; 91, 21; 105, 19; 128, 7; 165, 15; 166, 14, etc. the ‘settlement’ or ‘village,’ the German ‘Mark’ and its inhabitants. Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 142, 159, 161. accepting this view, sees in Vṛjana the ‘secure abode’ (kṣiti dhruvā) where the clan lives, 4) Rv. i. 51, 15; 73, 2 (cf. i. 73, 4). the clan itself as a village community (like Grāma), and the clan in war. 5) Rv. vii. 32, 27; x. 42, 10. Geldner, 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 139 et seq. on the other hand, takes the literal sense of Vṛjana ṭo be ‘net,’ developing all the other senses from that idea, but the traditional view seems more natural.

vRtraghna|वृत्रघ्न
वृत्र-घ्न<BR> occurs in a passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 1) viii. 23, 5. where in a Gāthā reciting the prowess of Bharata it is said that he bound horses on the Yamunā (Jumna) and Gaṅgā (Ganges) Vṛtraghne, which Sāyaṇa renders ‘at Vṛtraghna,’ as the name of a place. Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Aufrecht, Aitarecya Brāhmaṇa, 425. however, seems right in interpreting the form as a dative, ‘for the slayer of Vṛtra’--i.e., Indra.

vRtrashanku|वृत्रशङ्कु
वृत्र-शङ्कु,<BR> literally ‘Vṛtra-peg,’ found in one passage of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) xiii. 8, 4, 1. is said by the scholiast on the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra 2) xxi. 3, 31. to denote a stone pillar. This improbable interpretation is based on another passage in the same Brāhmaṇa. 3) iv. 2, 5, 15. Cf. Eggeling. Sacred Books of the East, 44, 437, n. 1.

vRddhadyumnaaabhiprataariNa|वृद्धद्युम्नआभिप्रतारिण
वृद्ध-द्युम्न आभिप्रतारिण<BR> (‘descendant of Abhipratārin’) is the name of a prince (rājanya) in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 48, 9), where his priest, Śucivṛkṣa Gaupalāyana, is praised. In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xv, 16, 10-13), on the contrary, he is said to have erred in the sacrifice, when a Brahmin prophesied that the result would be the expulsion of the Kurus from Kurukṣetra, an event which actually came to pass. 

vRddhavaashinii|वृद्धवाशिनी
वृद्ध-वाशिनी<BR> in the Nirukta (v. 21) denotes the ‘female jackal.’ ^1. Vṛśa. See Vṛṣa.

vRshajaana|वृशजान
2. Vṛśa Jāna (‘descendant of Jana’) is the name of a famous Purohita, who was unfortunate enough, while with his royal master, Tryaruṇa, to see a boy killed by the chariot which the king drove too fast. He thereupon recalled the boy to life. The story is told briefly in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 1) xiii. 3, 12. the Śāṭyāyanaka, 2) See Sāyaṇa on Rv. v. 2, and the Jaiminīya version in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 20. the Tāṇḍaka, 3) See Sāyaṇa, loc. cit. was also narrated in the Bhāllavi Brāhmaṇa, 4) Referred to in the Bṛhaddevatā, v. 23, apparently as cited in the Nidāna. The passage is not in the extant text of the Nidāna Sūtra. See Sieg. Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda 65, n. 5. and is preserved in the Bṛhaddevatā, 5) v. 14 et seq., where see Macdonell's notes. Sieg 6) Op, cit., 64-76. has endeavoured to trace the story in part in the Rigveda, 7) v. 2. but there is a consensus of opinion 8) Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 4, 324; Hillebrandt, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 33, 248 et seq.; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 46, 366 et seq.; Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 312. On the other hand, Geldner, Festgruss an Roth, 192, supports the tradition. Cf. Weber. Indische Studien, 10, 32. against the correctness of such a view.

vRshchika|वृश्चिक
वृश्चिक<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 191, 16. and the Atharvaveda 2) x. 4, 9, 15; xii. 1, 46; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 27. denote ‘scorpion.’ Its poison was feared 3) Rv., loc. cit.; Av. x. 4, 9. 15. like that of serpents. It is described as lying torpid in the earth during winter. 4) Av. xii. 1, 46. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

vRSha|वृष
वृष<BR> is the name of a plant of some kind in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 1) xxx. 1. Later the Gendarussa vulgaris is so styled. Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 2) iv. 8, 1. has Vṛśa, which Böhtlingk 3) Dictionary, General Inden to Supplements, 376. takes to mean a small animal, a quite possible sense. Cf. Yevāṣa. 

vRShakhaadi|वृषखादि
वृष-खादि<BR> is used as an epithet of the Maruts in the Rigveda. 1) i. 64, 10. The sense is doubtful: Bollensen 2) Orient und Occident, 2, 461, n. thought the expression referred to the wearing of rings in the ears; Max Müller 3) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 107, 120, Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 263. renders it ‘strong rings,’ comparing the later Cakra or discus.

vRShagaNa|वृषगण
वृष-गण<BR> is the name of a family of singers mentioned in one passage of the Rigveda. 1) ix. 97, 8. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 132.

vRShaNashva|वृषणश्व
वृषण्-अश्व<BR> is the name of a man referred to in the Rigveda, 1) i. 51, 13. where Indra is called Menā, perhaps his ‘wife’ or ‘daughter.’ The same legend is alluded to in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, 2) ii. 79 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 37). the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 3) iii. 3, 4, 18. the Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 4) i. 1, 16. and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, 5) i. 12, 3. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 81, n. 2. but it is clear that all of these texts had no real tradition of what was referred to.

vRShadaMsha|वृषदंश
वृष-दंश,<BR> ‘strong-toothed,’ is the name of the cat in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 21, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 12; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 31. where it figures as a victim at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’). It also appears in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa; 2) viii. 2, 2. the fact that the sneeze of the cat is here referred to renders it likely that the animal was already tamed. Geldner 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 313-315. sees a house cat in the animal alluded to in a hymn of the Atharvaveda 4) i. 18. by a set of curious epithets, including vṛṣadatī, ‘strong-toothed,’ but Whitney 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 19, 20; Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 153, n.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 261. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 86. decisively rejects the idea that the hymn refers to the domestic cat. 

vRShan|वृषन्
वृषन्<BR> in two passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 36, 10; vi. 16, 14. 15. Cf. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 152, 153; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 104. seems to denote a man, with the patronymic Pāthya in one of them.

vRShabha|वृषभ
वृषभ<BR> regularly denotes a ‘bull’ in the Rigveda, 1) i. 94, 10; 160, 3; vi. 46, 4; of Parjanya, vii. 101, 1, 6, etc. Roth renders vrsabhānna, ii. 16, 5, ‘eating strong food’; but the literal sense, ‘whose food is bulls,’ will answer. Cf. Māṃsa. but usually in a metaphorical sense.

vRShala|वृषल
वृषल<BR> in the dicing hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 34, 11. Cf. Nirukta, iii. 16. denotes an ‘outcast’; the same sense appears in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 2) vi. 4, 12 Mādhyaṃdina. where the touch of either a Vṛṣala or a Vṛṣalī is to be avoided.

vRShashuShmavaataavata|वृषशुष्मवातावत
वृष-शुष्म वातावत<BR> (‘descendant of Vātāvant’) Jātūkarṇya is the name of a priest in the Brāhmaṇas of the Rigveda. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 29, 1; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, ii. 9 (with a varia lectio Vādhāvata: Indische Studien, 1, 215, n. 1). Vṛṣaśuṣma in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa 2) Indische Studien, 4, 373. is probably intended for the same name.

vRShaarava|वृषारव
वृषा-रव,<BR> ‘roaring like a bull,’ is the name of some animal in the Rigveda. 1) x. 146, 2 = Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 5, 6. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) xii. 5, 2, 7. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 426: Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 90. the word occurs in the dual, meaning perhaps ‘mallet’ or ‘drumstick.’

vRShTi|वृष्टि
वृष्टि<BR> is the regular word for ‘rain’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 116, 12; ii. 5, 6, etc. and later. 2) Av. iii. 31, 11; vi. 22, 3, etc. 

vRShTihavya|वृष्टिहव्य
वृष्टि-हव्य<BR> is in the Rigveda 1) x. 115, 9. Cf. Max Mūller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 152, 153; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 108, 109. the name of a Ṛṣi, whose sons were the Upastutas.

veNu|वेणु
वेणु<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) i. 27, 3. and later 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 5, 2; vii. 4, 19, 2; Kāthaka Saṃhitā, xiii. 12; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 4, 19; ii. 6, 2, 17, etc. denotes a ‘reed’ of bamboo, It is described in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 3) v. 1, 1, 4. as ‘hollow’ (su-ṣira). In the Rigveda 4) viii. 55, 3. it occurs only in a Vālakhilya hymn in a Dānastuti (‘praise of gifts’), where Roth 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2. thinks that ‘flutes of reed’ are meant, a sense which Veṇu has in the later texts. The Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 6) iv. 12. couples Veṇu with Sasya, stating that they ripen in Vasanta, ‘spring.’ Apparently bamboo reeds are meant. 7) Cf. Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 6, 17, with the scholiast; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 343. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71.

vetasa|वेतस
वेतस<BR> is the name of the water plant Calamus Rotang, or a similar reed, in the Rigveda 1) iv. 58, 5. and later. 2) Av. x. 7, 41; xviii. 3, 5; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 3, 12, 2; 4, 4, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvii. 6; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 4, 3, etc. It is called ‘golden’ (hiraṇyaya) and ‘water-born’ (apsuja). 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 3, 12, 2, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71. ^3 Rv. loc. cit.; Av. x. 7, 41.

vetasu|वेतसु
वेतसु<BR> is a name occurring in the singular in two passages of the Rigveda 1) vi. 20, 8; 26, 4. and once in the plural. 2) x. 49, 4. It seems that he was defeated by Indra, but there is no reason to assume that he was a demon. Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 128. Cf. Kaegi, Die Rigveda, n. 337. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 55, 328. thinks that the Vetasus were probably the tribe of which Daśadyu was a member, and that they defeated the Tugras. The passages are too obscure to render any version probable. 

vetasvant|vetasvat|वेतस्वत्|वेतस्वन्त्
वेतस्वन्त्,<BR> ‘abounding in reeds,’ is the name of a place in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 1) xxi. 14, 20. not, as Weber 2) Indische Studien, 1, 32. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 69. once took it, a part of the name of Ekayāvan Gāṃdama.

veda|वेद
वेद<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) Av. vii. 54, 2; x. 8, 17; xv. 3, 7. and later 2) Traya, ‘threefold,’ Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 5, 10; xiii. 4, 3, 3; Nirukta, i. 2. 18. 20, etc. denotes ‘sacred lore.’ In the plural 3) Av. iv. 35, 6; xix. 2, 12; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 11, 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 32, 1; vi. 15, 11; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 11, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 3, 3, 7; xii. 3, 4, 11, etc. In the Brāhmaṇas the word, no doubt, has normally the sense of the extant collections, which appear under their accepted titles, Ṛgveda, Yajurveda, Sāmaveda, in the Āraṇyakas. it more definitely refers to the Vedas of the Ṛc, Yajus, and Sāman. Cf. Vidyā.

vedaanga|वेदाङ्ग
वेदाङ्ग,<BR> as the name of a text subsidiary to the study of the Rigveda, is first found in the Nirukta 1) i. 20. and the Rigveda Prātiśākhya. 2) xii. 40. Cf. Roth, Nirukta, xv. et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 42.

vena|वेन
1. Vena occurs in one passage of the Rigveda 1) x. 93, 14. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166. as a generous patron. Pṛthavāna, found in the same passage, may or may not be another name of his, and Pārthya in the following stanza of the hymn is perhaps his patronymic.

vena|वेन
2. Vena in the Rigveda 1) x. 123. is thought by Tilak 2) Oriea, 163 et seq Cf. Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, xciv. to be the planet Venus. But this is certainly impossible. 

vesha|वेश
1. Veśa is a term of somewhat doubtful sense, apparently denoting ‘vassal,’ ‘tenant,’ in a few passages, 1) Rv. iv. 3, 13; v. 85, 7; possibly x. 49, 5; but cf. 2. Veśa; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 5 (veśatva.); xxxi. 12; xxxii. 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, Kāṇva, ii. 5, 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 4, 8; ii. 3, 7; iv. 1, 13. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 204, who takes veśas in Av. ii. 32, 5, where pari-veśas also occurs in the same sense, and compares vaiśya in Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 7, 1, as meaning ‘servitude’ and, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1, veśa, and veśatva. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 75, who seems inclined to read veṣas in Av. ii. 32, 5; but Weber's explanation of the origin of the sense of ‘servant’ is adequate. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 135, n. 4, sees in Veśa either a neighbour or a member of the same village community. Cf. Sajāta. ‘dependent neighbour.’

vesha|वेश
2. Veśa may be a proper name in two passages of the Rigveda; 1) ii. 13, 8; x. 49, 5. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 152, 164. if so, it is quite uncertain whether a demon is meant or not.

veshantaa|वेशन्ता
वेशन्ता,<BR> 1) Av. xi. 6, 10; xx. 128, 8, 9; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 12, 1. Veśantī, 2) Av. i. 3, 7. Veśāntā, 3) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 3, 11. all denote a ‘pond’ or ‘tank.’ Cf. Vaiśanta.

veshas|वेशस्
वेशस्<BR> See 1. Veśa.

veshaantaa|वेशान्ता
वेशान्ता<BR> See Veśantā.

veshii|वेशी
वेशी<BR> in one passage of the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 17. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 264, n. seems to denote a ‘needle.’

veshman|वेश्मन्
वेश्मन्,<BR> ‘house,’ occurs in the Rigveda 1) x. 107, 10; 146, 3. and later. 2) Av. v. 17, 13; ix. 6, 30; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 24, 6, etc. In Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 2, 14, the single house (eka-veśman) of the king is contrasted with the numerous dwellings of the people. It denotes the house as the place where a man is ‘settled’ (viś). 

veshya|वेश्य
वेश्य<BR> in two passages of the Rigveda (iv. 26, 3; vi. 61, 14) seems to denote the relation of ‘dependence’ rather than ‘neighbourhood.’ Cf. 1. Veśa.

veShka|वेष्क
वेष्क<BR> in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (iii. 8, 1, 15) denotes the ‘noose’ for strangling the sacrificial animal. See Bleṣka.

vehat|वेहत्
वेहत्<BR> seems to mean a ‘cow that miscarries.’ It is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) xii. 4, 37 et seq. In iii. 23, 1, a woman is called vehat. and later. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 27; xxiv. 1, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 5, 3, etc. In Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 4, 4, 6, Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 195, adopts the sense ‘a cow desiring the bull.’ But cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 127.

vaikarNa|वैकर्ण
वैकर्ण<BR> occurs but once in the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 11. in the description of the Dāśarājña, where Sudās is stated to have overthrown the twenty-one tribes (janān) of the kings or folk of the two Vaikarṇas. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 103. conjectures that they were a joint people, the Kuru-Krivis: this is quite possible, and even probable. Vikarṇa as the name of a people is found in the Mahābhārata, 3) vi. 2105. and a lexicographer 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 261 et seq., who sees in Vaikarṇau the two Vaikarṇa kings. places the Vikarṇas in Kaśmīr, a reminiscence probably of a real settlement of the Kurus in that country. Cf. Uttara Kuru.

vaikhaanasa|वैखानस
वैखानस<BR> is the name of a mythical group of Ṛṣis who are said in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) xiv. 4, 7. to have been slain at Munimaraṇa by Rahasyu Devamalimluc, and who are mentioned in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka also. 2) i. 23, 3 (Indische Studien, 1, 78). An individual Vaikhānasa is Puruhanman. 3) xiv. 9, 29. 

vaijaana|वैजान
वैजान,<BR> ‘descendant of Vijāna,’ is Sāyaṇa's version of the patronymic of Vṛśa in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xiii. 3, 12. The real reading is vai Jānaḥ, as pointed out by Weber. 2) Indische Studien, 10, 32.

vaiTTabhaTiiputra|वैट्टभटीपुत्र
वैट्टभटी-पुत्र<BR> is the name in the Kāṇva recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 5, 2) of a teacher, a pupil of Kāraśakeyīputra, Cf. Vaidabhṛtīputra.

vaiDava|वैडव
वैडव,<BR> ‘descendant of Vīḍu,’ is the patronymic of a Vaisiṣṭha in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xi. 8, 14), where he is said to have been the seer of a Sāman or Chant.

vaiduurya|वैदूर्य
वैदूर्य,<BR> ‘beryl,’ is first found in the late Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa. 1) Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 40; Omina und Portenta, 325 et seq.

vaitaraNa|वैतरण
वैतरण<BR> occurs once in the Rigveda. 1) x. 61, 17. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2. thinks the word is a patronymic, but it seems rather 3) Ludwig, Translation of the Rig. veda, 3, 165; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 457, n. to be an adjective in the sense of ‘belonging to Vitaraṇa’ used of Agni, like Agni of Bharata or of Vadhryaśva.

vaitahavya|वैतहव्य
वैतहव्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Vītahavya,’ is the name of a family who are said in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 18, 10. 11; 19, 1. to have come to ruin because they devoured a Brahmin's cow. They are said to be Sṛñjayas, but as the exact form of the legend here referred to does not occur elsewhere, its authenticity is open to some doubt. 2) Moomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 434. According to Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 132. Vaitahavya is a mere epithet of the Sṛñjayas, but this is not probable 4) Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 405; Weber Indische Studien, 18, 233. in view of the existence of a Vītahavya. 

vaida|वैद
वैद,<BR> ‘descendant of Vida,’ is the patronymic of Hiraṇyadant in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) iii. 6, 4; Āśvalāyana Śranta Sūtra, xii. 10, 9. and the Aitareya Āraṇyaka. 2) ii. 1, 5. The word is also written Baida.

vaidathina|वैदथिन
वैदथिन,<BR> ‘descendant of Vidathin,’ is the patronymic of Ṛjiśvan in the Rigveda (iv. 16, 11; v. 29, 13).

vaidadashvi|वैददश्वि
वैदद्-अश्वि,<BR> ‘descendant of Vidadaśva,’ is the patronymic of Taranta in the Rigveda. 1) v. 61, 10. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 2) xiii. 7, 12. Cf. Śāṭyāyanaka in Sāyaṇa on Rv. ix. 58, 3. and the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa 3) i. 151; iii. 139, where Vaitadaśvi is the form. Cf. Ārṣeya Brāhmaṇa, p. 54 (ed. Burnell). Cf. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 360; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesell schaft, 42, 232, n.; Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 354; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 62 et seq.. the Vaidadaśvis are Taranta and Purumīlha. The latter is not a Vaidadaśvi in the Rigveda, a clear sign of the worthlessness of the legends relative to these two men in the Brāhmaṇas.

vaidabhRtiiputra|वैदभृतीपुत्र
वैदभृती-पुत्र,<BR> ‘son of a female descendant of Vedabhṛt,’ is the name of a teacher in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 4, 32). Cf. Vaiṭṭabhaṭīputra.

वैयाघ्र-पद्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Vyāghrapad,’ is the patronymic of Indradyumna Bhāllaveya in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) x. 6, 1, 8. and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 2) v. 14, 1. of Buḍila Āśvatarāśvi in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 3) v. 16, 1. and of Gośruti in that Upaniṣad 4) v. 2, 3. and in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka. 5) ix. 7 (Gośruta-vaiyāghrapadya as a compound). In the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 6) iii. 40, 1; iv. 16. 1. the patronymic is applied to Rāma Krātujāteya. 

vaiyaaska|वैयास्क
वैयास्क<BR> is read in one passage of the Rigveda Prātiśākhya, 1) xvii. 25. as the name of an authority on the metres of the Rigveda. Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. is clearly right in thinking that Yāska is meant. 3) The name not being a patronymic from Viyāska, but standing for vai Yāskaḥ, Cf. Vaijāna.

vaira|वैर
वैर<BR> 1) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 1, 12. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 5, 2, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, ix. 2; Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā, viii. 5; Maitrāyaṇī, Saṃhitā, i. 7, 5, all of which have vīram for vairam, perhaps wrongly. and Vaira-deya 2) Rv. v. 61, 8 (on the exact sense of which, cf. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 361; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 92; Oldenberg, RgvedaNoten, 1, 354); Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā xxiii. 8; xxviii. 2. 3. 6. seem to have in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas the definite and technical sense of ‘wergeld,’ the money to be paid for killing a man as a compensation to his relatives. This view is borne out by the Sūtras of Āpastamba 3) i. 9, 24, 1-4. and Baudhāyana. 4) i. 10, 19, 1, 2. Both prescribe the scale of 1,000 cows for a Kṣatriya, 5) The crime of slaying a Brahmin is too heinous for a wergeld. See Āpastamba, i. 9, 24, 7 et seq.; Baudhāyana, i. 10, 18, 18. 100 for a Vaiśya, 10 for a Śūdra, and a bull over and above in each case. Āpastamba leaves the destination of the payment vague, but Baudhāyana assigns it to the king. It is reasonable to suppose that the cows were intended for the relations, and the bull was a present to the king for his intervention to induce the injured relatives to abandon the demand for the life of the offender. The Āpastamba Sūtra 6) i. 9, 24, 5. allows the same scale of wergeld for women, but the Gautama Sūtra 7) i. 10, 19, 3. puts them on a level with men of the Śūdra caste only, except in one special case. The payment is made for the purpose of vaira-yātana or vaira-niryātana, ‘requital of enmity,’ ‘expiation.’ The Rigveda 8) ii. 32, 4. preserves, also, the important notice that a man's wergeld was a hundred (cows), for it contains the epithet śata-dāya, ‘one whose wergeld is a hundred.’ No doubt the values varied, but in the case of Śunaḥśepa the amount is a hundred (cows) in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 9) vii. 15, 7. In the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 10) See n. 1. The word is not found in the Taittirīya. śata-dāya again appears. The fixing of the price shows that already public opinion, and perhaps the royal authority, was in Rigvedic times diminishing the sphere of private revenge; on the other hand, the existence of the system shows how weak was the criminal authority of the king (cf. Dharma). Cf. Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 41, 672676; Bühler and von Schroeder, Festgruss an Roth, 44-52; Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, 2, 78, 79; 14, 201 Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 402 Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 131, 132; Delbrück in Leist, Altarisches Jus Gentium, 297.

vaishanta|वैशन्त
वैशन्त<BR> is the name in the Rigveda 1) vii. 33, 2. of a prince whose offering Indra is said to have deserted for that of Sudās through the aid of the Vasiṣṭhas. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173. thinks that the name is Veśanta, and that he was a priest of the Pṛthu-Parśus; Griffith 3) Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 24, n. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 130. says that probably a river is meant, but neither of these views is plausible.

vaishaMpaayana|vaishampaayana|वैशंपायन|वैशम्पायन
वैशंपायन,<BR> ‘descendant of Viśaṃpa,’ is the name of a teacher, famous later, but in the earlier Vedic literature known only to the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (i. 7, 5) and the Gṛhya Sūtras.

vaishaaleya|वैशालेय
वै-शालेय,<BR> ‘descendant of Viśāla,’ is the patronymic of the mythic Takṣaka in the Atharvaveda (viii. 10, 29).

vaishiiputra|वैशीपुत्र
वैशी-पुत्र,<BR> ‘the son of a Vaiśya wife,’ is mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 9, 7, 3; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2. 

vaishya|वैश्य
वैश्य<BR> denotes a man, not so much of the people, as of the subject class, distinct from the ruling noble (Kṣatriya) and the Brāhmaṇa, the higher strata of the Āryan community on the one side, and from the aboriginal Śūdra on the other. The name is first found in the Puruṣa-sūkta (‘hymn of man’) in the Rigveda, 1) x. 90, 12. and then frequently from the Atharvaveda 2) v. 17. 9. onwards, 3) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 5. etc. See Varṇa. sometimes in the form of Viśya. 4) Av. vi. 13, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 48, etc. The Vaiśya plays singularly little part in Vedic literature, which has much to say of Kṣatriya and Brahmin. His characteristics are admirably summed up in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 5) vii. 29. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 439. in the adjectives anyasya bali-kṛt, ‘tributary to another’; anyasyādya, ‘to be lived upon by another’; and yathākāmajyeyaḥ, ‘to be oppressed at will.’ He was unquestionably taxed by the king (Rājan), who no doubt assigned to his retinue the right of support by the people, so that the Kṣatriyas grew more and more to depend on the services rendered to them by the Vaiśyas. But the Vaiśya was not a slave: he could not be killed by the king or anyone else without the slayer incurring risk and the payment of a wergeld (Vaira), which even in the Brahmin books extends to 100 cows for a Vaiśya. Moreover, though the Vaiśya could be expelled by the king at pleasure, he cannot be said to have been without property in his land. Hopkins 6) India, Old and New, 222 et seq. thinks it is absurd to suppose that he could really be a landowner when he was subject to removal at will, but this is to ignore the fact that normally the king could not remove the landowner, and that kings were ultimately dependent on the people, as the tales of exiled kings show. On the other hand, Hopkins 7) Op. cit., 210 et seq. is clearly right in holding that the Vaiśya was really an agriculturist, and that Vedic society was not merely a landholding aristocracy, superimposed upon an agricultural aboriginal stock, as Baden Powell 8) Indian Village Community, 190 et seq. urged. Without ignoring the possibility that the Dravidians were agriculturists, there is no reason to deny that the Āryans were so likewise, and the goad of the plougher was the mark of a Vaiśya in life 9) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 1. and in death. 10) Kauśika Sūtra, lxxx. It would be absurd to suppose that the Āryan Vaiśyas did not engage in industry and commerce (cf. Paṇi, Vaṇij), but pastoral pursuits and agriculture must have been their normal occupations. In war the Vaiśyas must have formed the bulk of the force under the Kṣatriya leaders (see Kṣatriya). But like the Homeric commoners, the Vaiśyas may well have done little of the serious fighting, being probably ill-provided with either body armour or offensive weapons. That the Vaiśyas were engaged in the intellectual life of the day is unlikely; nor is there any tradition, corresponding to that regarding the Kṣatriyas, of their having taken part in the evolution of the doctrine of Brahman, the great philosophic achievement of the age. The aim of the Vaiśya's ambition was, according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 11) ii. 5, 4, 4. to become a Grāmaṇī, or village headman, a post probably conferred by the king on wealthy Vaiśyas, of whom no doubt there were many. It is impossible to say if in Vedic times a Vaiśya could attain to nobility or become a Brahmin. No instance can safely be quoted in support of such a view, 12) Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 55 et seq., argues to the contrarya from Buddhist evidence; but this has no cogency for the Vedic period, and much, if not all, of it is hardly in point as concerns this issue. though such changes of status may have taken place (see Kṣatriya and Varṇa). It is denied by Fick 13) Die sociale Gliederung, 163, et seq. that the Vaiśyas were ever a caste, and the denial is certainly based on good grounds if it is held that a caste means a body within which marriage is essential, and which follows a hereditary occupation (cf. Varṇa). But it would be wrong 14) Cf. Indian Empire, 1, 347. to suppose that the term Vaiśya was merely applied by theorists to the people who were not nobles or priests. It must have been an early appellation of a definite class which was separate from the other classes, and properly to be compared with them. Moreover, though there were differences among Vaiśyas, there were equally differences among Kṣatriyas and Brāhmanas, and it is impossible to deny the Vaiśyas' claim to be reckoned a class or caste it the other two are such, though at the present day things are different. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 213 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 1 et seq.; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 7 et seq.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 242, 243; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 76 et seq. (for the Epic Vaiśya).

vaishvaamitra|वैश्वामित्र
वैश्वा-मित्र,<BR> ‘descendant of Viśvāmitra,’ is the term by which that famous priest's line is referred to in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (vii. 17 et seq.).

vaiShThapureya|वैष्ठपुरेय
वैष्ठ-पुरेय,<BR> ‘descendant of Viṣṭhapura,’ is the name of a teacher in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad in the Mādhyaṃdina recension (ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 25). He was a pupil of Śāṇḍilya and Rauhiṇāyana.

व्यछ<BR> in go-vyacha, the name of one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda, 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 18; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 16, 1. Cf. Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 4. is of uncertain signification. According to Sāyaṇa, 2) On Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. the compound denotes a ‘driver out of cows.’ Perhaps it means a ‘tormentor of cows,’ as the St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it. Weber 3) Indische Streifen, 1, 82, n. 11. This interpretation is supported by the use of the word in the Kāṭhaka, where it replaces the Govikartana of other texts, See Ratnin (p. 200). renders it as ‘knacker of cows,’ Eggeling as ‘one who approaches cows.’ ^4 Sacred Books of the East, 44, 416.

vyadvara|व्यद्वर
व्य्-अद्वर,<BR> 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 4, 1, 27. Cf. Av. vi. 50, 2. Vy-advarī, 2) Av. iii. 28, 2, where a worm is certainly not meant. are the names of a ‘gnawing’ (ad, ‘eat’) animal in the Atharvaveda and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. Cf. also Vyadhvara, which the St. Petersburg Dictionary would read throughout. 

vyadhvara|व्यध्वर
व्यध्वर,<BR> ‘perforating,’ designates a worm in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) ii. 31, 4. where there seems to be no good reason to alter the reading to Vyadvara, though Whitney 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 74. thinks that it may rather be connected with vi-adhvan 3) This would mean ‘diverging from the road,’ ‘devious.’ than with the root vyadh, ‘pierce.’ 4) The Padapāṭha analyzes the word as vi-adhvara. The term occurs with Maśaka, ‘fly,’ in the Hiraṇyakeśi Gṛhya Sūtra, 5) ii. 16, 3. and perhaps also in another passage of the Atharvaveda, 6) vi. 50, 3. where, however, both Whitney 7) Op. cit., 318, Cf. 135. Cf. also Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 316, 361, 487; Lanman in Whitney, op. cit., 318. and Shaṅkar Paṇḍit read Vyadvara.

vyalkashaa|व्यल्कशा
व्यल्कशा<BR> is the name of a plant in the Rigveda. 1) x. 16, 13. Cf. Zimmer Altindisches Leben, 70.

vyashva|व्यश्व
व्य्-अश्व<BR> is the name of a Ṛṣi, a protégé of the Aśvins, 1) Rv. i. 112, 15. mentioned in several hymns of the eighth Maṇḍala, 2) viii. 23, 16. 23; 24, 22; 26, 9. which may have been the composition of a descendant of his, Viśvamanas. In two other passages 3) Rv. viii. 9, 10; ix. 65, 7. he is referred to only as a Ṛṣi of the past, and Oldenberg 4) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft 42, 217. points out that none of his own work appears in the Saṃhitā. The Rigveda also mentions 5) Rv. viii. 24, 28. the Vyaśvas, with whom Ludwig 6) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 106. is inclined to connect Vaśa Aśvya. An Āṅgirasa Vyaśva occurs as a seer of Sāmans or Chants in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 7) xiv. 10. 9.

vyaShTi|व्यष्टि
व्य्-अष्टि<BR> is the name of a mythical teacher in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) iv. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 Mādhyaṃdina. 

vyaakhyaana|व्याख्यान
व्या-ख्यान<BR> in one passage of the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) iii. 6, 2, 7. clearly denotes a ‘narrative’ merely--viz., that of the dispute of Kadrū and Suparṇī. In other passages 2) vi. 1, 27. 33; vii. 2, 4, 28. the word means simply ‘commentary.’ In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 3) ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 6 (Mādhyaṃdina = 2 Kāṇva); 5, 11. used in the plural, it signifies a species of writing, apparently ‘commentaries,’ though its exact relation to Anuvyākhyāna must remain obscure. Sieg 4) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 21, 34. thinks that the Vyākhyānas were forms of narrative like Anvākhyāna and Anuvyākhyāna.

vyaaghra|व्याघ्र
व्याघ्र,<BR> ‘tiger,’ is never found in the Rigveda, but frequently occurs in the Atharvaveda, 1) iv. 3, 1; 36, 6; vi. 38, 1; 103, 3; 140, 1; xii. 1, 49; 2, 43; xix. 46, 5; 49, 4. as well as the lion This fact is legitimately regarded as an indication that the Atharvaveda belongs to a period when the Vedic Indian had approached and entered the territory of Bengal. Later, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 5, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 9; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 9; xix. 10; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 5, 3 Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 7, 1, 8; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 9, 3; 10, 2, etc. also, mention of the tiger is quite common. The Taittirīya Saṃhitā 3) v. 4, 10, 5. preserves a reference to the danger of waking a sleeping tiger. The destructive character of the animal is often alluded to, 4) Cf. Av. iv. 36, 6; viii. 5, 11, and see Śaśayu. the man-eater (puruṣād) 5) Av. xii. 1, 49. being also mentioned. Like the lion, the tiger passes as a symbol of strength. 6) Av. iv. 8, 4, 7. Cf. Yāska, Nirukta, iii. 18. This idea is illustrated by the fact that the king at the Rājasūya (‘royal consecration’) steps 7) Av. iv. 8, 4. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 92. He does not wear the skin, as Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 79, says. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities 249, 250. on a tiger's skin to win himself the strength of the animal. Cf. also Śārdūla, Petva.

vyaaghrapadya|व्याघ्रपद्य
व्याघ्र-पद्य<BR> is a false reading in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (v. 16, 1) for Vaiyāghrapadya. 

vyaadhi|व्याधि
व्याधि,<BR> ‘disease,’ occurs several times in Vedic literature. 1) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 10, 3; Saḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 4; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iii. 4, 8. The specific diseases are dealt with under the separate names, but the Vedic texts also mention innumerable bodily defects. The list of victims 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 10. 17. 21; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 6, 1; 14, 1; 17, 1. at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) includes a ‘dwarf’ (vāmana, kubja), a ‘bald’ person (khalati), 3) Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 6, 5. a ‘blind’ man (andha), 4) Cf. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 2, 9; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 1, 9; 13, 2; viii. 4, 2; 9, 1; 10, 1; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iii. 3. a ‘deaf’ man (badhira), 5) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 2, 10; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 1, 10; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, loc. cit. a ‘dumb’ man (mūka), 6) Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, loc. cit. a ‘fat’ man (pīvan), a ‘leper’ (sidhmala, kilāsa), 7) Kilāsa also in Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 3, 17; xxiii. 16, 11. etc. a ‘yellow-eyed’ man (hary-akṣa), a ‘tawny-eyed’ man (piṅgākṣa), a ‘cripple’ (pīṭha-sarpin), a ‘lame’ man (srāma), a ‘sleepless’ man (jāgaraṇa), a ‘sleepy’ man (svapana), one 8) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 22; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 19, 1, where are added the man who winks too much (ati-mirmira), has too prominent teeth (ati-dantura) or too small teeth (ati-kiriṭa). and who stares excessively (ati-memiṣa), Cf. Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 84, n. 4. ‘too tall’ (ati-dīrgha), one ‘too short’ (ati-hrasva), one ‘too stout’ (ati-sthāla or aty-aṃsala), one ‘too thin’ (ati-kṛśa), one ‘too white’ (ati-śukla), one ‘too dark’ (ati-kṛṣṇa), one ‘too bald’ (ati-kulva), and one ‘too hairy’ (ati-lomaśa). In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 9) iv. 1, 9; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 8, 9. Cf. Av. vii. 65, 3. the man with bad nails and the man with brown teeth are mentioned along with sinners like the Didhiṣūpati. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10) xiii. 3, 6, 5. See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 323, n. mentions a ‘white-spotted (śukla), bald-headed man, with projecting teeth (viklidha) and reddish-brown eyes.’ Interesting is Zimmer's 11) Altindisches Leben, 428. suggestion that kirmira found in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 12) xxx. 21. means ‘spotty’ as an intermixture of races, but it is only a conjecture, apparently based on a supposed connexion of the word with kṛ, ‘mix.’ In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 13) xxx. 15, especially avijātā and vijarjarā, beside avatokā and paryāyiṇī; atītvarī and atiṣkadvarī are also possibly so to be understood. Cf. Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 80. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 14) iii. 4, 11, 1, where apaskadvarī and paryāriṇī are read. various epithets are applied to women, some of which seem to denote disease, and in the Atharvaveda 15) i. 18, 4. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 314, understands the hymn as referring to the domestic cat, but this lacks plausibility. The sense of the other epithets there occurring is quite obscure. the feminine adjectives, ‘antelope-footed’ (ṛśya-padī) and ‘bulltoothed’ (vṛṣa-datī), probably refer to bodily defects.

vyaana|व्यान
व्य्-आन<BR> is the name of one of the vital airs. See Prāṇa.

vyaama|व्याम
व्याम<BR> in the Saṃhitās 1) Av. vi. 137, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 1, 4; 2, 5, 1, etc. and the Brāhmaṇas 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 2, 3, 1. 2; i. 2, 5, 14; vii. 1, 1, 37, where the scholiast equates it to 4 Aratnis or cubits (while the scholiast on Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, ix. 1, 9, regards it as equal to 5 Aratnis). According to the Śulva Sūtra of Baudhāyana, the Aratni equals 24 aṅgula (= (3/4) inch). See Fleet, Journal of the Royal Asiatie Society, 1912, 231, 233, 234. denotes the ‘span’ of the outstretched arms as a measure of length. It may be estimated at six feet or equivalent to a fathom. 3) See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 309, n. 5.

vyaasapaaraasharya|व्यासपाराशर्य
व्यास पाराशर्य<BR> (‘descendant of Parāśara’) is the name of a mythical sage who in the Vedic period is found only as a pupil of Viṣvaksena in the Vaṃśa (list of teacheres) at the end of the Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa and in the late Taittirīya Āraṇyaka. 1) i. 9, 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 156; 4, 377; Indian Literature, 184, n. 199.

vra|व्र
व्र,<BR> according to Roth, 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Bechtel, Nachrichten der königlichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, 1894, 393. means ‘troop’ in the Rigveda 2) i. 124, 8; 126, 5; iv. 1, 16; viii. 2, 6; x. 123, 2. He omits i. 121, 2, where Bölitlingk, Dictionary, s.v., treats the word as a feminine (vrā). and the Atharvaveda. 3) ii. 1, 1, a confused passage, on which see Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 37, 38. Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 162. sees in the word (in the feminine form of vrā) a designation in one passage of the village host which formed part of the Viś, and was composed of relations (su-bandhu). On the other hand, Pischel 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 121, 313 et seq. thinks that in all the passages Vrā means ‘female,’ used either of animals 6) Rv. i. 121, 2; viii. 2, 6 (female elephants). or of women who go to the feast (Samana), 7) Rv. i. 124, 8. or courtezans (viśyā, ‘of the people’), 8) Rv. i. 126. 5. or, metaphorically, 9) Rv. iv. 1, 16; x. 123, 2; Av., loc. cit. the hymns compared with courtezans; these senses are perhaps adequate.

vraja|व्रज
व्रज<BR> denotes in the first instance, in the Rigveda, 1) Rv. ii. 38, 8; x. 26, 3, and perhaps 97, 10; 101, 8. Cf. Medhātithi on Manu, iv. 45, and Mahābhārata, i. 41, 15, where go-vraja is equal to gavāṃ pracārāḥ, ‘the pastures of the kine,’ in i. 40, 17. the place to which the cattle resort (from vraj, ‘go’), the ‘feeding ground’ to which the milk-giving animals go out 2) Rv. ii. 38, 8. in the morning from the village (Grāma), while the others stay in it all day and night. 3) Cf. Sāyaṇa on Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 18, 14. Secondarily it denotes the ‘herd’ 4) Rv. v. 35, 4; vii. 27, 1; 32, 10; viii. 46, 9; 51, 5. itself. This is Geldner's view, 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 282 et seq.; Rigreda, Glossar, 174. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 77. which seems clearly better than that of Roth 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. But cf. Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. who regards Vraja as primarily the ‘enclosure’ (from vṛj), and only thence the ‘herd’; for the Vraja does not normally mean an ‘enclosure’ at all: the Vedic cattle were not stall-fed as a general rule. In some passages, however, ‘pen,’ 7) Av. iii. 11, 5; iv. 38, 7; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, ii. 16. Metaohorically, in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 22, Mādhyaṃdina, it is a pen with a bolt (sārgala) and with a palisade (sa-pariśraya). The sense of ‘pen’ is also possible in Rv. x. 97, 10; 101, 8, and is not radically opposed to it, for Vraja denotes the place where the cattle are fed, and can therefore be applied to the stall where they are during the night. Cf. Goṣṭha. in others ‘stall,’ 8) Rv. x. 4, 2, where the ‘warm Vraja’ to which the cows resort is alluded to, and iv. 51, 2, where the Dawns open wide the doors of the Vraja of darkness; Taittirīya. Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 12, 2, where the Vraja is said to be made of Aśvattha wood. The sense of ‘stall’ is probable in Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 25. is certainly meant. The word is often used in the myth of the robbing of the kine. 9) See Geldner, op. cit., 2, 283 et seq. It occasionally denotes a ‘cistern.’ 10) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 4 = Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 11, 1 = Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 7. 

vrata|व्रत
व्रत<BR> (‘vow’) in the later Saṃhitās 1) Av. vi. 133, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 5, 3. 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iv. 11. etc. and the Brāhmaṇas 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 2, 10. 14, 17; 4, 2, 15; ix. 2, 1, 18. Cf. ghṛtavrata, Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xviii. 2, 5. 6, and vrata-dughā, the ‘cow that gives the Vrata milk,’ Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 2, 14; xiv. 3, 1, 34. etc. has the peculiar sense of the ‘milk’ used by one who is living on that beverage alone as a vow or penance.

vratati|व्रतति
व्रतति<BR> in the Rigveda 1) viii. 40, 6; Nirukta, i. 14; vi. 28. and later 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 1, 3, etc. denotes a ‘creeping plant.’

vraajapati|व्राजपति
व्राज-पति<BR> is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 179, 2 = Av. vii. 72, 2. where it is said that comrades attend Indra, as the Kulapas the Vrājapati, when he goes about. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 171. thinks that this refers to the heads of families being subordinate in war to the village headman (Grāmaṇī), but Whitney 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 436. seems to be right in seeing merely the chieftain surrounded by the leading men, the family heads, not necessarily merely a village headman. Vrāja alone occurs in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 4) i. 16, 1. Cf. Whitney, op. cit., 17. adverbially in the sense of ‘in troops.’

vraajabaahu|व्राजबाहु
व्राज-बाहु<BR> is used in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (ii. 9) of the ‘encompassing arms’ of death, Vrāja here apparently meaning a ‘pen,’ like Vraja. Cf. Viṣṭhā-vrājin.

vraata|व्रात
व्रात<BR> is found in several passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 163, 8; iii. 26, 2; v. 53, 11; ix. 14, 2 (perhaps an allusion to the five tribes); x. 34, 8. 12 (of dice). In x. 57, 5, the host of the living (jīva vrāta) is referred to. and later 2) Av. ii. 9, 2 (‘host of the living’); Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 10, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 25; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vi. 9. 24; xvii. 1, 5. 12, etc. in the sense of ‘troop.’ In one passage of the Rigveda 3) v. 53, 11. Cf. iii. 26, 2, where śardha is not mentioned. the troops of the Maruts are referred to by three different terms--śardha, vrāta, and gaṇa. From this fact Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 162. has deduced that a Vedic host fought according to clan (Viś), village (Grāma), and family, but this conclusion is hardly warranted, there being nothing to show that there is any intention to present a distinct series of divisions. It is not probable that the word ever has the technical sense of ‘guild,’ as Roth 5) In the St. Petersburg Dictionary, where this is taken to be the sense; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vi. 9, 25; xvii. 1, 5, 12; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 25; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 10, 2. thinks. Cf. Vrātapati.

vraatapatii|व्रातपती
व्रात-पती,<BR> ‘lord of troops,’ is an epithet included in the names of Rudra in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās, 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 4, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 13; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 25. along with the epithet Gaṇa-pati, ‘lord of groups.’ The exact sense is quite uncertain, but the term may allude to the chief of a band of robbers, as Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 179. thinks.

vraatya|व्रात्य
व्रात्य<BR> is included in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda, 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 8; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 5, 1. where, however, no further explanation of the name is given. Fuller information is furnished by the Atharvaveda, 2) xv. 1, 1 et seq. the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 3) xvii. 1-4. and the Sūtras. 4) Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, xii. 1; xxii. 4; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 6; Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, xxii. 5, 4-14. See Hillebrandt, Ritualliteratur, 139, 140. which describe at length a certain rite intended for the use of Vrātyas. According to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, there are four different kinds of ‘outcasts’--viz., the hīna, who are merely described as ‘depressed’; those who have become outcasts for some sin (nindita); those who become outcasts at an early age, apparently by living among outcasts; and those old men who, being impotent (śama-nīcameḍhra), have gone to live with outcasts. The last three categories are by no means of the same importance as the first. The motive of the fourth is hard to understand: according to Rājārām Rām krishṇa Bhāgavat, 5) Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, 19, 360. they were men who had enfeebled their constitutions by undue intercourse with women in the lands of the outcasts, and returned home in a debilitated state. But this is not stated in the text. It seems probable that the really important Vrātyas were those referred to as hīna, and that the other classes were only subsidiary. According to Rājārām, 6) Ibid., 359. there were two categories of the first class: (a) The depressed (hīna), who were nonĀryan; and (b) degraded Āryans (gara-gir). This, however, is a mere guess, and devoid of probability. There seems to have been but one class of Vrātyas. That they were non-Āryan is not probable, for it is expressly said 7) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 1 that, though unconsecrated, they spoke the tongue of the consecrated: they were thus apparently Āryans. This view is confirmed by the statement that ‘they call what is easy of utterance, difficult to utter’: probable they and already a somewhat Prakritic form of speech (cf. Vāc). The Sūtras mention their Arhants (‘saints’) and Yaudhas (‘warrioes’), corresponding to the Brahminical Brāhmaṇa and Kṣatriya. Other particulars accord with the view that they were Āryans outside the sphere of Brahmin culture. Thus they are said 8) Ibid., xvii. 1, 2. not to practise agriculture or commerce (an allusion to a nomadic life), not to observe the rules of Brahmacarya--i.e., the principle regulating the Brahminic order of life. They were also allowed to become members of the Brahminical community by performance of the ritual prescribed, which would hardly be so natural in the case of non-Āryans. Some details are given of the life and dress of the Vrātyas. Their principles were opposed to those of the Brahmins: they beat those unworthy of correction. 9) Ibid., xvii. 1, 14. Their leder (Gṛhapati) or householder wore a turbrn (Uṣṇīṣa), carried a whip (Pratoda), a kind of bow (Jyāhroḍa), was clothed in a black (kṛṣṇaśa) garment and two skins (Ajina), black and white (kṛṣṇa-valakṣa), and owned a rough vagon (Vipatha) covered with planks (phalakāstīrṇa). The others, 10) Ibid., xvii. 1, 15. The exact sense of the passages is obscure; and was, as Lāṭyāyana shows, already obscure in his time and earlier; the translations given are all vague. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 32 et seq.; Indian Literature, 67, 68; Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 31, 32; Rājārām, loc. cit. subordinate to the leader, had garments with fringes of red (valūkāntāni dāmatūṣāṇi), two fringes on each, skins folded double (dviṣaṃhitāny ajināni), and sandals (Upānah). The leader wore also an ornament (Niṣka) of silver, which Rājārām 11) Op. cit., 361. converts into a silver coinage. The Vrātyas, on becoming consecrated, were expected to hand over their goods to the priest. Many other details are given in the Sūtras (e.g., that the shoes or sandals were of variegated black hue and pointed), but these are not authenticated by the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. The locality in which the Vrātyas lived cannot be stated with certainty, but their nomad life 12) Which is indicated by their name, ‘belonging to a roving band’ (vrāta), ‘vagrant.’ suggests the western tribes beyond the Sarasvatī. But they may equally well have been in the east: this possibility is so far supported by the fact that the Sūtras make the Brahmin receiving the gift of the Vrātya's outfit an inhabitant of Magadha. The Atharvaveda 13) See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 770 et seq., with Lanman's additions. does not help, for it treats the Vrātya in so mystical a way that he is represented as being in all the quacters. Indeed, Roth 14) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. believed that it was here not a case of the Vrātya of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa at all, but of a glorification of the Vrātya as the type of the pious vagrant or wandering religious mendicant (Parivrājaka). This view is clearly wrong, as the occurrence of the words uṣṇīsa, vipatha, and pratoaa shows. It is probable that the 15th Book of the Atharvaveda, which deals with the Vrātya, and is of a mystical character, exalts the converted Vrātya as a type of the perfect Brahmicārin, and, in so far, of the divinity. 15) Boomfield, Atharvaveda, 94.

व्रीहि,<BR> ‘rice,’ is never mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) To take dhānya bīja in Rv. v. 53, 13, as ‘rice seeds’ is unnecessary and very improbable, nor is there better reason to see in dhānya rasa in Av. ii. 26, 5. a ‘rice drink.’ but is frequently alluded to in the Atharvaveda 2) vi. 140, 2; viii. 7, 20; ix. 6, 14, etc. and later. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 2, 10, 3, where it is said to ripen in autumn; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 6; xi. 5; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 10, 2; iv. 3, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 12; AitareyaBrāhmaṇa, ii. 8, 7; 11, 12; viii. 16, 3.4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 5, 9; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 3, 22 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 3, 13 Kāṇva); Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iii. 14, 3. Rice seems to be indigenous in the south-east of India: 4) ii. 3, 1, 3. Cf. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 1, 7, 3, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 4. 5, 6, etc. this fact accounts well for the absence of any mention of it in the Rigveda. Black and white rice is contrasted in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 5) i. 8, 10, 1. where also 6) Av. xi. 4, 13; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 43; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 10, 6, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 239. the distinctions of dark, swift-growing (āśu), and large rice (mahā-vrīhi) are found. Probably the swift-growing variety is that later known as ṣaṣṭika, ‘ripening in sixty days.’ Vrīhi and Yava, ‘barley,’ are normally conjoined in the texts.^7 Cf. Plāśuka.

vleShka|व्लेष्क
व्लेष्क<BR> See Bleṣka. Ś.

shaMyu|शंयु
शंयु<BR> is the name of a mythical son of Bṛhaspati. He is quoted as a teacher in the texts of the Yajurveda. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 10, 1; v. 2, 6, 4; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 8, 11; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 9, 1, 24; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, i. 5, 2. Cf. Lévi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 113.

shakaTa|शकट
शकट,<BR> 1) Nirukta, vi. 22; xi. 47; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 1, 8. Śakaṭī, 2) Rv. x. 146, 3; Saḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iv. 7. are rare words in the older literature for a ‘cart.’ The creaking of a cart is referred to in the Rigveda 2) Rv. x. 146, 3; Saḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iv. 7. as like the sound heard by night in the forest. 

shakadhuuma|शकधूम
शक-धूम<BR> is found in one hymn of the Atharvaveda, 1) vi. 128, 1, 3. 4, and in the Nakṣatra Kalpa. where it is celebrated as the king of the asterisms. The word seems to mean the ‘smoke of (burning) cow-dung,’ or else the ‘smoke (rising) from (fresh) cow-dung’: it may well be, as Weber 2) Omina and Portenta, 363; Indische Studien, 5, 257; 10, 65; Naxatra, 2, 272, n.; 293. thinks, that this was deemed to be significant of the weather. Bloomfield, 3) American Journal of Philology, 7, 484 et seq.; Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, cxxxiii; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 532, 533. however, considers that the word is to be rendered as ‘weather prophet,’ that is, one who foretells the weather by means of the smoke of a fire. Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda. 377, 378. objects to this view with reason. It is not at all improbable that, as Roth 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 353; Caland, Altindisches Zauberritnal, 175, n. 3. believed, an asterism of some sort is meant, probably the ‘milky way.’

shakapuuta|शकपूत

shakaMbhara|शकंभर
शकं-भर,<BR> ‘bearer of dung,’ is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) v. 22. 4. where the sense is doubtful. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 510. and Grill 3) Hundert Lieder^2, 154. see in it a tribal name, Bloomfield 4) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 445, 446. the personification of excessive evacuation (diarrhœa), while Whitney 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 259. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 253. considers that it may refer to the Mahāvṛṣas, despised as having to collect dung for fuel in the absence of wood in their country.

shakaa|शका
शका<BR> is the name of one of the victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 12, 1; 18, 1; Maitrāyaṇi Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 13; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 32. It is uncer tain whether a kind of bird 2) Mahīdhara on Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit. or fly, 3) Sāyaṇa on Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 12, 1; 18, 1. or long-eared beast 4) Sāyaṇa on Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 12, 1.

shakuna|शकुन
शकुन,<BR> ‘bird,’ is mentioned frequently in the Rigveda 1) iv. 26, 6; ix. 85, 11; 86, 13; 107, 20; 112, 2; x. 68, 7; 106, 3; 123, 6; 165. 2. and later. 2) Av. xii. 1, 51; 3, 13; xx. 127, 4; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 6, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvii. 53, etc. It usually denotes a large bird, 3) Cf. Av. xi. 2, 24, as compared with Vayas; Nirukta, iii. 18. or a bird which gives omens. 4) Cf. Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, vii. 4; Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad, vi. 34, etc. Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 430. compares  which also is a bird of omen.

shakuni|शकुनि
शकुनि,<BR> ‘bird,’ is used practically like Śakuna, but with a much clearer reference to divination. It was smaller than the Śyena or Suparṇa, 1) Rv. ii. 42, 2. gave signs, 2) Rv. ii. 42, 1; 43, 3. and foretold ill-luck. 3) Av. x. 3, 6. When it is mentioned 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 19, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 40; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 21. in the list of sacrificial victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’), a special species must be meant: later the falcon is so called, but the ‘raven’ may be intended; the commentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā thinks that it is the ‘crow.’ It is mentioned several times elsewhere. 5) Av. ii. 25, 2; vii. 64, 1; xi. 9, 9; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxv. 7; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 15, 12; iv. 7, 3; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1, 1, 31; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 8, 2, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 88, 430.

शकुन्तला<BR> is the name of an Apsaras who bore Bharata, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) xiii. 5, 4, 13. at Nāḍapit. Weber 2) Episches im vedischen Ritual, 6. doubtfully reads the latter word as Nāḍapitī, an epithet of Śakuntalā.

shakunti|शकुन्ति
शकुन्ति<BR> is found in the Rigveda (ii. 42, 3; 43, 1) denoting a ‘bird’ of omen.

shakula|शकुल
शकुल<BR> in the later Saṃhitās 1) Av. xx. 136, 1; Vājasanevi Saṃhitā, xxii. 28. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 97. denotes an unknown species of fish.

shakRt|शकृत्
शकृत्,<BR> 1) Used only in nominative and accusative: Rv. i. 161, 10; Av. xii. 4, 9; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 19, 3, etc. Śakan, 2) In the oblique cases Śakan is the base, Av. xii. 4, 4; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 7, 23, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 9. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236. denotes ‘dung’ in the Rigveda and later. It is clear that the value of manure was early appreciated (see Karīṣa). For the use of the smoke of dung or of a dung fire for prognosticating the weather, see Śakadhūma.

shakti|शक्ति
1. Śakti is said in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa 1) ii. 390 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 47). to have been the son of Vasiṣṭha, and to have been cast into the fire by the Viśvāmitras. According to Ṣaḍguruśiṣya, 2) Sarvānukramaṇī, ed. Macdonell, p. 107, and on Rv. vii. 32. who appears to follow the Śāṭyāyanaka, 3) Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 159, n. 3. the story of Śakti is as follows: Viśvāmitra, being defeated in a contest by Śakti, had recourse to Jamadagni, who taught him the Sasarparī; later he revenged himself on Śakti by having him burnt in the forest. The Bṛhaddevatā 4) iv. 112 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. relates the first part of the tale only. Geldner 5) Op. cit., 2, 159 et seq.; more doubtfully, Rigveda, Kommentar, 89. sees in the Rigveda 6) iii. 53, 22. a description of the death struggle of Śakti, but this interpretation is more than doubtful. 7) Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 254.

shaktiiaangirasa|शक्तीआङ्गिरस

shakvarii|शक्वरी
शक्वरी,<BR> fem. plur., denotes the Śakvarī verses, known also as the Mahānāmnī verses, to which the Śākvara Sāman (chant) is sung. This sense seems to occur in the Rigveda, 1) vii. 33, 4; x. 71, 14; Nirukta, i. 8. and is certain later. 2) Av. xiii. 1, 5; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 8, 5; 6, 2, 3; iii. 4, 4, 1; v. 4, 12, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvi. 4; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, x. 6, 5; xii. 13, 12; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 5, 11; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 1, 1; 9, 2, 17, etc. Cf.

Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 228, who compares śūcī in Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 10; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 10, 3.

शचीवन्त्<BR> is apparently the name of a man in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 74. 5. where the vocative Śacīvaḥ occurs. But Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 108; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 489, n. perfers to read Śacī ca instead.

shaNa|शण
शण<BR> denotes a kind of ‘hemp’ (Cannabis sativa or Crotolaria juncea). It is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 4, 5. as growing in the forest, and as used like the Jaṅgiḍa as a remedy against Viṣkandha. It also occurs in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa. 2) iii. 2, 1, 11 i. 6, 1, 24; 2, 15. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 68.

shatadyumna|शतद्युम्न
शत-द्युम्न<BR> (‘possessing a hundred glories’) is the name of a man who, along with Yajñeṣu, was made prosperous by the priest Mātsya through his knowledge of the exact moment for sacrifice, according to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (i. 5, 2, 1).

शत-पति<BR> occurs in a verse of the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 1) iv. 14, 12. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 2) ii. 8, 4, 2. as an epithet of Indra, who is described as alone the ‘lord of a hundred’ among men. To interpret the expression as ‘lord of a hundred gods,’ as does the commentary on the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, is obviously impossible. It seems clear that there is a reference to an analogous human functionary--viz., the lord of a hundred villages, known in the later law 3) See Foy, Die königliche Gewalt, 74.<BR> --who was probably at once a judicial deputy of the sovereign and a revenue collector, an ancient magistrate and collector.

He was clearly a Bharata. He is also alluded to in the Atharvaveda. 3) i. 35. 1 = Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 52, in connexion with the Dākṣāyaṇas.

shatriaagniveshi|शत्रिआग्निवेशि
शत्रि आग्नि-वेशि<BR> (‘descendant of Agniveśa’) is the name of a generous patron in the Rigveda. 1) v. 34. 9. Cf. Ludwig. Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155.

shaMtanu|शंतनु
शं-तनु<BR> is the hero of a tale told by Yāska, 1) Nirukta, ii. 10. and often found later. 2) Bṛhaddevatā, vii. 155 et seq., with Macdonell's notes; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 129 et seq. He supersedes his elder brother Devāpi as king of the Kurus. When his improper deed brings on a prolonged drought in his realm, he is compelled to ask his brother to assume the kingship; Devāpi, however, refuses, but instead performs a sacrifice which produces rain. Sieg 3) Loc. cit. endeavours to trace this story in the Rigveda, 4) x. 98. but all that is there stated is that Devāpi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa obtained (no doubt as priest) rain for Śaṃtanu (no doubt a king). There is no hint of relationship at all.

shapatha|शपथ
शपथ<BR> in the Rigveda 1) x. 87, 15; Nirukta, vii. 3. and later 2) Av. iii. 9, 5; iv. 9, 5; 18, 7; 19, 7. etc. denotes a ‘curse,’ not an ‘oath,’ as a judicial process. But that an oath of such a kind was possible as it was later, 2) Av. iii. 9, 5; iv. 9, 5; 18, 7; 19, 7. etc. is shown by at least one passage of the Rigveda, 3) vii. 104, 15. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 326, 327. where the speaker, possibly Vasiṣṭha, imprecates death on himself if he is a wizard, and death on his foes if he is not.

shapha|शफ
1. Śapha, ‘hoof,’ comes to be used to denote the fraction ‘one-eighth,’ because of the divided hoofs of the cow, just as Pāda, the ‘foot’ of a quadruped, also means a ‘quarter.’ This sense in found as early as the Rigveda, 1) viii. 47, 17. and is not rare later. 2) Av. vi. 46, 3; xix. 57, 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 10, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 3, 3, etc. Cf.

Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 458, n. 4; 476. is the name (used in the dual) of a wooden implement, acting like a pair of tongs, for lifting an iron pot from the fire. It is probably so called because it resembled a hoof in being divided. 

shaphaka|शफक
शफक<BR> is the name of some plant in the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 34, 5. It is also mentioned in the Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, 2) ix. 14, 14. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 138; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda 207. where it seems to denote an edible water plant or fruit, perhaps a water nut. It may be so called from its leaves being shaped like hoofs (Śapha).

shaphaala|शफाल
शफाल<BR> is the name of Ṛtuparṇa's kingdom in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sātra. 1) xx. 12. Cf. Caland, U7ber das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 21, 36.

शमी<BR> is the name of a tree in the Atharvaveda 1) Av. vi. 11, 1; 30, 2, 3. and later. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 9, 6; 4, 7, 4 (for the lower araṇī); Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvi. 6; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 3, 11 et seq.; 6, 4, 5; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 2, 12; ix. 2, 3, 37, etc. It is described in the Atharvaveda 3) Av. vi. 30, 2. 3. as destructive to the hair, 4) In the Dhanvantarīya Nighaṇṭu, p. 188 (ed. Poona), the Śamī and its fruit are said to destroy the hair. as producing intoxication, and as broad-leaved. These characteristics are totally wanting in the two trees, Prosopis spicigera or Mimosa suma, with which the Śamī is usually identified. 5) See Roth in Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 302. From the soft wood of the Śamī was formed the lower of the two sticks (araṇī) used for kindling the sacred fire, 6) Av. vi. 11, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 1, 15; Cf. 13; iii. 4, 1, 22; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 9, 6; 4, 7, 4. the upper one (the drill) being of Aśvattha. The fruit of the tree is called Śamīdhānya. 7) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 1, 10. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 59, 60.

shambara|शम्बर
शम्बर<BR> is the name of an enemy of Indra in the Rigveda. 1) i. 51, 6; 54, 4; 59, 6; 101, 2; 103, 8; 112, 14; 130, 7; ii. 12, 11; 14, 6; 19, 6; iv. 26, 3; 30, 14; vi. 18, 8; 26, 5; 31, 4; 43, 1; 47, 2. 21; vii. 18, 20; 99, 5. He is mentioned along with Śuṣṇa, Pipru, and Varcin, being in one passage called a Dāsa, son of Kulitara. 2) Rv. vi. 26, 5. In another passage 3) Rv. vii. 18, 20. he is said to have deemed himself a godling (devaka). His forts, ninety, 4) Rv. i. 130, 7. ninety-nine, 5) Rv. ii. 19, 6. or a hundred 6) Rv. ii. 14, 6. in number, are alluded to, the word itself in the neuter plural once 7) Rv. ii. 24, 2. meaning the ‘forts of Śambara.’ His great foe was Divodāsa Atithigva, who won victories over him by Indra's aid. 8) Rv. i. 51, 6; 130, 7; ii. 19, 6; iv. 26, 3, etc. It is impossible to say with certainty whether Śambara was a real person or not. Hillebrandt 9) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 103, 108; 3, 273. is strongly in favour of the theory that he was a real chief as enemy of Divodāsa: he relies on the statistics 10) Seven times in Maṇḍala i; four in ii; two in iv; six in vi; two in vii. These references show primā facis greater reality in Maṇḍala vi than elsewhere. The references in ii. are certainly all of the mythical kind, and those in vii are of much the same sort. of the mention of the name to show that, where as he was conceived as a real foe in the hymns of the time of Divodāsa, later texts, like those of the seventh Maṇḍala, make him into a demon, as a result of the change of scene from Arachosia to India. As a matter of fact, apart from this theory, Śambara was quite possibly an aboriginal enemy in India, living in the mountains. 11) Rv. i. 130, 7; iv. 30, 14; vi. 26, 5. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 177; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 161; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 210; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 178. 

shambin|शम्बिन्
शम्बिन्,<BR> a word occurring only once, appears to mean ‘ferryman’ in the Atharvaveda (ix. 2, 6). The literal sense is probably ‘pole-man’ (from śamba, a word of doubtful signification found in the Rigveda, x. 42, 7).

shaMmadaangirasa|शंमदाङ्गिरस
शंमद् आङ्गिरस<BR> (‘descendant of Aṅgiras’) is the name of the seer of a Sāman or Chant in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xv. 5, 11). Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologic. 2, 160.

Cf. xi. 1, 6; xv. 7, 6; Grierson, Bihar Pcasant Life, 194, and illustration, p. 33; Cuningham, The Stūpa of Bharhut, Plate xxviii.; Caland and Henry, L'Agniṣṭoma, 49. The Śamyā was also used as a measure of length. 6) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 6, 2. According to the commentary on Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, v. 3, 20, the length was 32 Aṅgulas, or fingerbreadths This would be equivalent to 2 feet: cf. Fleet, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1912, 232.

shayaaNDaka|शयाण्डक
शयाण्डक<BR> is the form in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) v. 5, 14, 1. of the name of an animal which in the Maitrāyaṇī 2) iii. 14. 14. and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitās 3) xxiv. 33. is written as Śayaṇḍaka. Some sort of bird is meant according to Roth, 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95. but the commentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā equates the word with Kṛkalāsa, ‘chameleon.’ 

shayu|शयु
शयु<BR> is the name in the Rigveda 1) i. 112, 16; 116, 22; 117, 20; 118, 8; 119, 6; vi. 62, 7; vii. 68, 8; x. 39, 13; 40, 8. of a protégé of the Aśvins, who made his cow to give milk.

sharaarchatka|शरअर्चत्क
2. Śara Arcatka (‘descendant of Ṛcatka’) is the name of a Ṛṣi in the Rigveda. 1) i. 116, 22; cf. perhaps. i. 112, 16; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 103, Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 150. It is very doubtful, however, whether Ārcatka is really a patronymic.

sharashauradevya|शरशौरदेव्य
3. Śara Śaura-devya (‘descendant of Śūradeva’) is the name of a generous prince in the Rigveda, 1) viii. 70, 13-15. who gave one calf to three singers. That this Dānastuti (‘praise of gifts’) is ironical seems certain. 2) Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 5-7; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163; 5. 175.

sharad|शरद्
शरद्<BR> See Ṛtu.

The animal is spoken of as akin to the goat; 3) Av., loc. cit.; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 52, n. 1, accepts the traditional rendering. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 89. it was probably a kind of deer.

sharabha|शरभ
2. Śarabha is the name of a Ṛṣi in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 100, 6. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163.

shariira|शरीर
शरीर,<BR> ‘body,’ is a word of frequent occurrence in Vedic literature. 1) Rv. i. 32, 10; x. 16, 1, etc.; Av. v. 9, 7; xviii. 3, 9, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 55; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 7, 2, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 13; 14, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 1, 4, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 1, 8. The interest of the Vedic Indians seems early to have been attracted to the consideration of questions connected with the anatomy of the body. Thus a hymn of the Atharvaveda 2) x. 2. enumerates many parts of the body with some approach to accuracy and orderly arrangement. 3) Cf. Hoernle, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 10-12; Osteology, 109-111, 242. It mentions the heels (pārṣṇī), the flesh (māṃsa), the ankle-bones (gulphau), the fingers (aṅgulīḥ), the apertures (kha), the two metatarsi (uchlakau), the tarsus (pratiṣṭhā), the two knee-caps (aṣṭhīvantau), the two legs (jaṅghe), the two knee-joints (jānunoḥ sandhī). Then comes above the two kness (jānū) the foursided (catuṣṭaya), pliant (śithira) trunk (kabandha). The two hips (śroṇī) and the two thighs (ārū) are the props of the frame (kusindha). Next come the breast-bone (uras), the cervical cartilages (grīvāḥ), the two breast pieces (stanau), the two shoulder-blades (kaphoḍau), the neck-bones (skandhau), and the backbones (pṛṣṭīḥ), the collar-bones (aṃsau), the arms (bāhū), the seven apertures in the head (sapta khāni śīrṣaṇi), the ears (karṇau), the nostrils (nāsike), the eyes (cakṣaṇī), the mouth (mukha), the jaws (hanū), the tongue (jihvā), the brain (mastiṣka), the forehead (lalāṭa), the facial bone (kakāṭikā), the cranium (kapāla), and the structure of the jaws (cityā hanvoḥ). This system presents marked similarities with the later system of Caraka and Suśruta, 4) Osteology, 112. which render certain the names ascribed to the several terms by Hoernle. Kaphoḍau, which is variously read in the manuscripts, 5) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 568. is rendered ‘collar-bone’ by Whitney, but ‘elbow’ in the St. Petersburg Dictionary. Skandha in the plural regularly 6) Av. x. 7. 3 (where the Skandhas are compared with the Kṛttikās, probably because both were seven in number, but this is not certain); 9, 20; vi. 135, 1; xii. 5, 67; Hoernle, Journal, 1906, 918; 1907, 1, 2. denotes ‘neck-bones,’ or, more precisely, ‘cervical vertebræ,’ a part denoted also by uṣṇihā in the plural. 7) Av. vi. 134, 1; Rv. vi. 163, 2= Av. ii. 33, 2; Av. ix. 8, 21; x. 10, 20. Pṛṣṭī 8) Rv. x. 87. 10 = Av. viii. 3, 10; Av. ix. 7, 5, 6; x. 9, 20; xii. 1, 34; xviii. 4, 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 6, 2, 7. See Hoernle, Journal, 1907. 2 et seq.; Whitney, op. cit., 548; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44. 164. n. 2. denotes not ‘rib,’ which is parśu, 9) Av. ix. 7, 6, etc. but a transverse process of a vertebra, and so the vertebra itself, there being in the truncal portion of the spinal column seventeen vertebræ and thirty-four transverse processes. The vertebræ are also denoted by kīkasā in the plural, 10) Av. ix. 7, 5; 8, 14. which sometimes 11) Av. xi. 8, 15. is limited to the upper portion of the vertebral column, sometimes 12) Av. ii. 33, 2; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 6, 2, 10. to the thoracic portion of the spine. Anūka also denotes the vertebral column, 13) Av. iv. 14, 8. Cf. ix. 8, 21 (the spine of the trunk). or more specially the lumbar 14) Av. ii. 33, 2. or thoracic 15) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 2, 4. 12. 14. Cf. the phrase īṣc anūkye, Av. xi. 3, 9, where the two shafts of a cart are compared with the transverse processes of a vertebra. portion of the spine; it is said in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 15) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 2, 4, 12. 14. Cf. the phrase īṣc anūkye, Av. xi. 3, 9, where the two shafts of a cart are compared with the transverse processes of a vertebra. that there are twenty transverse processes in the lumbar spine (udara) and thirty-two in the thoracic, which gives twenty-six vertebræ, the true number (but the modern division is seven cervical, twelve thoracic, five lumbar, and two false--the sacrum and the coccyx). The vertebral column is also denoted by karūkara, 16) Av. xi. 9, 8; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 124. which, however, is usually found in the plural 17) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 2, 4, 10, 14. denoting the transverse processes of the vertebræ, a sense expressed also by kuntāpa. 18) Ibid., xii. 2, 4, 12. Grīvā, in the plural, denotes cervical vertebræ, the number seven being given by the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 19) Ibid. xii. 2, 4, 10. but usually 20) Rv. vi. 163, 2 = Av. ii. 33, 2; Av. vi. 134, 1; ix. 7, 3; x. 9, 20; xi. 8, 15; Hoernle, Journal, 1906, 916 et seq. the word simply means windpipe, or, more accurately, the cartilaginous rings under the skin. Jatru, also in the plural, denotes the cervical cartilages, 21) Rv. vii. 1, 12 = Av. xiv. 2, 12. or possibly the costal cartilages, which are certainly so called in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 22) xii. 2, 4, 11. Cf. vii. 6, 2, 10; Hoernle, Journal, 1906, 922 et seq. where their number is given as eight. Bhaṃsas, which occurs thrice in the Atharvaveda, 23) Av. ii. 33, 5; ix. 8, 21, with a fuller version in the Paippalāda recension (Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 77, 551). In viii. 6, 5, it denotes vulva: Hoernle, 16-18. seems to denote the pubic bone or arch rather than the ‘buttocks’ or ‘fundament,’ as Whitney 24) Loc. cit. takes it. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 25) x. 5, 4, 12; xii. 3, 2, 3, 4; Hoernle, Osteology, 238, 239, and the criticism in 106-109, which shows how far removed the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa is from a scientific system. Cf. Keith, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 62, 135 et seq. the number of bones in the the human body is given as 360. The number of the bones of the head and trunk are given in another passage 26) xii. 2, 4, 9-14; Hoernle, Osteology, 240. as follows: The head is threefold, consisting of skin (tvac), bone (asthi), brain (matiṣka); the neck has 15 bones: 14 transverse processes (karūkara) and the strength (vīrya)--i.e., the bone of the centre regarded as one--as the 15th; the breast has 17: 16 cervical cartilages (jatru), and the sternum (uras) as the 17th; the abdominal portion of the spine has 21: 20 trans verse processes (kuntāpa), and the abdominal portion (udara) as the 21st; the two sides have 27: 26 ribs (parśu), and the two sides as the 27th; the thoracic portion of the spine (anūka) has 33: 32 transverse processes, and the thoracic portion as 33rd. There are several enumerations of the parts of the body, not merely of the skeleton, in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 27) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 81-93; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 9; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxviii. 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 4. They include the hair (lomāni), skin (tvac), flesh (māṃsa), bone (asthi), marrow (majjan), liver (yakṛt), lungs (kloman), kidneys (matasne), gall (pitta), entrails (āntrāṇi), bowels (gudāḥ), spleen (plīhan), navel (nābhi), belly (udara), rectum (vaniṣṭhu), womb (yoni), penis (plāśi and śepa), face (mukha), head (śiras), tongue (jihvā), mouth (āsan), rump (pāyu), leech (vāla), eye (cakṣus), eyelashes (pakṣmāṇi), eyebrows (utāni), nose (nas), breath (vyāna), nose-hairs (nasyāni), ears (karṇau), brows (bhrū), body or trunk (ātman), waist (upastha), hair on the face (śmaśrūṇi), and on the head (keśāḥ).

Cf. Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 1. In the Aitareya Āraṇyaka 31) i. 2, 2. the human body is regarded as made up of one hundred and one items; there are four parts, each of twenty-five members, with the trunk as one hundred and first. In the two upper parts there are five four-jointed 32) This is contrary to fact: Hoernle, Osteology, 122, 123. fingers, two kakṣasī (of uncertain meaning), 33) Perhaps the armpit regarded as in some way double; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 175. the arm (dos), the collar-bone (akṣa), and the shoulder-blade (aṃsa-phalaka). In the two lower portions there are five four-jointed toes, the thigh, the leg, and three articulations, according to Sāyaṇa's commentary. The Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 34) ii. 2. enumerates three bones in the head, 35) Cf.

The Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 40) iii. 2, 9. enumerates four constituents in the head (prāṇa, cakṣus, śrotra, vāc), but there are many variations, the number going up to twelve on one calculation. 41) See references in Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 185, 192, 195. The numbers vary and are fanciful, being of no scientific importance. In the Taittirīya Upaniṣad 42) i. 7, 1. an enumeration is given consisting of carma (skin), māṃsa, snāvan, asthi, and majjan; and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 43) vi. 29, 4. has lomāni, māṃsa, tvac, asthi, majjan, and the Aitareya Āraṇyaka 44) iii. 2, 1. 2; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, viii. 1. 2. couples majjānaḥ, snāvāni, and asthīni.

Henry, 5) Le livre vii de l' Atharvavéda, 82. and Bloomfield 6) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 554, 555. think.

shardha|शर्ध
शर्ध<BR> See Vrāta.

shardhya|शर्ध्य
शर्ध्य<BR> in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 119, 5. is taken by Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. as perhaps denoting a part of the chariot. The sense is, however, quite uncertain.

sharya|शर्य
शर्य,<BR> 1) i. 119, 10, where the sense is not certain. Śaryā, 2) i. 148, 4; x. 178, 3. Cf. Nirukta v. 4; x. 29. seem in the Rigveda to denote an ‘arrow.’ 3) As derived from 1. Śara, and meaning literally ‘made from a reed.’ Perhaps, also, Śaryā 4) Rv. ix. 110, 5; x. 61, 3. and Śarya 5) Rv. ix. 14, 4; 68, 2. (neut.) mean the ‘wicker work’ in the Soma sieve, but the exact sense of the passages is doubtful. 6) Hillebrandt; Vedische Mythologie, 1, 52, takes śaryāṇi in Rv. ix. 68, 2, as denoting the outer husk of the Soma plant. See also Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 255, n. 1.

sharyaNaavant|sharyaNaavat|शर्यणावत्|शर्यणावन्त्
शर्यणावन्त्<BR> occurs in several passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 84, 14; viii. 6, 39; 7, 29; 64, 11; ix. 65, 22; 113, 1; x. 35, 2. See Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 64 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 17); Śāṭyāyanaka in Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 84, 13. in all of which Sāyaṇa sees a local name. According to his account, Śaryaṇāḥ (masc. plur.) is a district in Kurukṣetra, Śaryaṇāvant being a lake not far from it in the back part (jaghanārdhe) of Kurukṣetra. The unusual consistency of his statements on this point is in favour of the word being a place name; it is also to be noted that Kurukṣetra contained the lake Anyataḥplakṣā. Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. however, thought that in two passages 3) i. 84, 14; x. 35, 2. the word denoted merely a ‘lake,’ literally ‘(water) covered with a thicket of reeds’ (śaryaṇa), and in the others a Soma vessel. Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 19, 20. inclines to this rendering. On the other hand, Pischel 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 217. So Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 398, 399. accepts Sāyaṇa's view. Hillebrandt 6) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 126, et seq. also sees in the word a place name, but he is inclined to locate it among the ‘five tribes,’ 7) This is deduced, not with any certainty, from Rv. ix. 65, 22. which is not quite inconsistent with its being in Kurukṣetra, for the connexion of the Pūrus with the later Kurus is known; 8) Hillebrandt, op. cit., 1, 142, n. 4, Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 205. or perhaps, he suggests, Śaryaṇāvant is an old name for the Wular sea of Kaśmīr, which was only a reminiscence in Vedic times. This is not probable; still less so is Ludwig's hypothesis 9) Op. cit., 3, 201. that the Śaryaṇāvant is the later eastern Sarasvatī. Bergaigne 10) Religion Védique, 1, 206. regards the name as that of a celestial preparer of Soma.

sharyaata|शर्यात
शर्यात<BR> is mentioned once in the Rigveda 1) i. 112, 17. as a protégé of the Aśvins. Of him in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa^2 and the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa 3) iii. 120-122 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, cxlv). is told a story how Cyavana was annoyed by the Śāryātas, and appeased by the gift of Sukanyā, Śaryāta's daughter, as a wife, and how Cyavana was then restored to youth by the Aśvins. He is there called Mānava (‘descendant of Manu’). He appears also as Śaryāta Mānava, a sacrificer, in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 4) iv. 7, 1; 8, 3, 5. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 250 et seq.; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 272 et seq.; Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 236, 237.

shala|शल
शल<BR> is explained by the St. Petersburg Dictionary as a measure of length in the Atharvaveda, 1) viii. 7, 28. Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 2) xii. 10 (Indische Studien, 3, 464). and Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 3) i. 5, 10, 1 (where this is the interpretation of the commentator). Whitney 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 501. objects that the sense in all 5) He does not notice the Kāṭhaka. Against his criticism it must be noted that in every one of the passages a numeral is compounded with Śala, as tri-śala, etc. these passages is not suited by this meaning.

shalabha|शलभ
शलभ,<BR> ‘locust,’ appears in the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 5, 9. for Śarabha, the reading of the received text, and is regarded by Whitney 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 534. But the mention of the goat in the passage strongly supports Sarabha. See Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa i. 2, 3, 9. as making better sense.

shalalii|शलली
शलली<BR> denotes the ‘quill’ of the porcupine, used for parting the hair and anointing the eyes. 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiii. 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 6, 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 4, 5. 

shaluna|शलुन
शलुन<BR> is found in the Atharvaveda 1) ii. 31, 2. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 73; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 315; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98 (Śalunna). denoting a ‘worm.’ The Paippalāda recension reads Śalūla, and Sāyaṇa Śalga.

shalka|शल्क
शल्क<BR> denotes in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 9, 3; 4, 2, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xx. 8; xxvii. 7, etc. and the Brāhmaṇas 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 14, 4; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 9, 9; 2, 1, 15. chip' or ‘shaving’ used for kindling a fire, etc.

shalmall|शल्मल्ल्
शल्मल्ल्<BR> is the name of the ‘silk cotton tree’ (Salmalia Malabarica). Its fruit is regarded as poisonous in the Rigveda, 1) vii. 50, 3. but the car of the bridal procession is made of its wood. 2) x. 85, 20. It is described as the tallest of trees. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 12, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 13; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2, 7, 4; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ix. 4, 11, etc. Cf.

shavarta|शवर्त
शवर्त<BR> is the name of a species of ‘worm’ in the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 4, 16, with the various reading Svavarta, Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 531. and the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 2) v. 7, 23, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98. Possibly Roth is right in holding that the word = śava-varta, a worm ‘living on carrion.’

shavas|शवस्
शवस्<BR> is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Agnibhū Kāśyapa in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373. 

shavasa|शवस

shaviShTha|शविष्ठ
शविष्ठ<BR> is, according to Ludwig, 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. the name of a generous patron in the Rigveda. 2) viii. 74, 14, 15.

shasha|शश
शश,<BR> ‘hare,’ is found once in the Rigveda, 1) x. 28, 2. Later, a goat supplants the hare in this curious story; see Böthling, Proceedings of the Saxon Academy, 1894, et seq. where it is said to have swallowed a razor. The animal is occasionally mentioned later also. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 56; xxiv. 38; Maitrāyaṇī Samhitā, iii. 14, 15; the hare in the moon, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 1, 5, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 84.

shashayu|शशयु
शशयु,<BR> ‘pursuing the hare,’ is the epithet of some animal (Mṛga) in the Atharvaveda. 1) iv. 3, 6. Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 79, 84. thinks the tiger is meant, but this is not likely. Roth 3) In Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 149. considers that a bird of prey is intended, while Whitney, 4) Loc. cit. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 368. following the commentator, renders the word by ‘lurking.’

shashvatii|शश्वती
शश्वती<BR> See Āsaṅga.

shaShpa|शष्प
शष्प<BR> in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 13, 81; xxi. 29; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5, 3; 8, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 7, 2, 8; 9, 1, 2, etc. denotes ‘young or sprouting grass.’

shastR|शस्तृ
शस्तृ<BR> in the Rigveda (i. 162, 5) and the Atharvaveda (ix. 3, 3) denotes the slaughterer of an animal. 

shastra|शस्त्र
शस्त्र<BR> is the technical term 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 7, 2, etc.; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxix. 2, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 25. 28, etc.; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 2, 4, 20, etc. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 353, and Caland and Henry, L'Agniṣṭoma, passim, where the Śastras are set out at length. for the ‘recitation’ of the Hotṛ priest, as opposed to the Stotra of the Udgātṛ. The recitations at the morning offering of Soma are called the Ājya and Praüga; at the midday offering, the Marutvatīya and the Niṣkevalya; at the evening offering, the Vaiśvadeva and the Āgnimāruta.

shaakaTaayana|शाकटायन
शाकटायन,<BR> ‘descendant of Śakaṭa,’ is the patronymic of a grammarian referred to by Yāska 1) Nirukta, i. 3, 12 et. seq. and in the Prātiśākhyas, 2) Rigveda Prātiśakhya, i. 3; xiii. 16; Vājasaneyi Prātiśakhya, iii. 8, etc. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 143, 151, 152, 217. as well as often later.

shaakadaasabhaaDitaayana|शाकदासभाडितायन
शाक-दास भाडितायन<BR> (‘descendant of Bhaḍita’) is mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373 as the pupil of Vicakṣaṇa Tāṇḍya.

shaakapuuNi|शाकपूणि
शाक-पूणि,<BR> ‘descendant of Śakapūṇa,’ is the name of a grammarian often mentioned in the Nirukta. 1) iii. 11; viii. 5, 6, 14; xii. 19; xiii. 10, 11. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 85.

shaakala|शाकल
शाकल<BR> in the Aitaṛeya Brāhmaṇa 1) iii. 43, 5 (Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 277). Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 33, n. denotes the ‘teaching of Śākalya’ according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary. But Böhtlingk 2) Dictionary, s.v. seems right in taking it as a kind of snake in that passage.

shaakalya|शाकल्य
शाकल्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Śakala,’ is the patronymic of Vidagdha in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) xi. 6, 3, 3; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 9, 1; iv. 1, 7, etc. and of Sthavira in the Aitareya 2) iii. 2, 1. 6. and Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyakas. 3) vii. 16; viii. 1. 11. An undefined Śākalya is mentioned in the same Āraṇyakas, 4) Aitareya, iii. 1, 1; Śāṅkhāyana, vii. 1. in the Nirukta, 5) vi. 28. and often later, as a teacher dealing with the text of the Rigveda. Weber 6) Indian Literature, 32, 33. is inclined to identify Vidagdha with the Śākalya who is known as the maker of the Pada Pāṭha of the Rigveda, but Oldenberg 7) Prolegomena, 380, n. thinks that the latter was later than the Brāhmaṇa period. Geldner 8) Vedische Studien, 3, 144-146. identifies the two; this view, however, is not very probable. 9) Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 239, 240.

shaakaayanin|शाकायनिन्
शाकायनिन्,<BR> in the plural, denotes the followers of Śākāyanya in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (x. 4, 5, 1).

शाकायन्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Śāka,’ is the patronymic of Jāta in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 1) xxii. 7 (Indische Studien, 3, 472). Cf. Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad, i. 2; vi. 29.

shaakin|शाकिन्
शाकिन्,<BR> plur., is believed by Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 521, n. to designate a group of generous donors in the Rigveda. 2) v. 52, 17.

shaaktya|शाक्त्य
शाक्त्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Śakti,’ is the patronymic of Gaurivīti. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 19, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 8, 3, 7; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 14; xii. 13, 10; xxv. 7, 2; Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, xxiii. 11, 14; xxiv. 10, 6. 8.

shaakvara|शाक्वर
शाक्वर<BR> See Śakvarī.

shaakhaa|शाखा
शाखा<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 8, 8; vii. 43, 1; x. 94, 3. and later 2) Av. iii. 6, 8; x. 7, 21; xi. 2, 19, etc. denotes the ‘branch’ of a tree. Vayā is more often used in this sense in the Rigveda. 

shaaNGkhaayana|शाङ्खायन
शाङ्खायन<BR> as the name of a teacher is not mentioned in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, but it occurs in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) at the end of the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 1) xv. 1. Oldenberg's suggestion (Sacred Books of the East, xxix. 4, 5) that Guṇākhya is intended as the author of the Sūtras is quite unnecessary; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 328. where Guṇākhya is given as the authority for that work. In the Śrauta Sūtras 2) Hillebrandt, Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 1, viii et seq. the name of Śāṅkhāyana never occurs, but the Gṛhya Sūtras 3) Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 10; vi. 10; Śāmbavya Gṛhyā Sūtra in Indische Studien, 15, 154; Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 4, 4. Cf. Kārikā in Nārāyaṇa on Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 1, 10; Ānartīya on Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 2, 18. seem to recognize as teacher Suyajña Śāṅkhāyana. In later times 4) Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, 2, xxxi. the school flourished in Northern Gujarat. Śāṅkhāyana appears in the Taittirīya Prātiśākhya 5) xv. 7. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 32, 44, 50 et seq.; 80, 313, 314; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 45, 191, 205, 245, 249. along with Kāṇḍamāyana.

shaaTyaayana|शाट्यायन
शाट्यायन,<BR> ‘descendant of Śāṭya,’ is the patronymic of a teacher mentioned twice in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) viii. 1, 4, 9; x. 4, 5, 2. and often in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 2) i. 6, 2; 30, 1; ii. 2, 8; 4, 3; 9, 10; iii. 13, 6; 28, 5. In a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the latter work 3) iv. 16, 1. he is called a pupil of Jvālāyana, while in the Vaṃśa at the end of the Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa he appears as a pupil of Bādarāyaṇa. The Śāṭyāyanins, his followers, are frequently mentioned in the Sūtras, 4) Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 5, 18; Anupada Sūtra, i. 8; ii. 9; iii. 2, 11; iv. 8, etc.; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 44. the Śāṭyāyani Brāhmaṇa 5) Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, v. 23, 3. and the Śāṭyāyanaka 6) Ibid., x. 12, 13. 14; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 2, 24; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 4, 13. being also referred to in them. It has been shown by Oertel 7) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, ccxli; 18, 20 et seq. Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 203; Aufrecht, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 151, 152. that this Brāhmaṇa bore a close resemblance to, and probably belonged to the same period as, the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa. 

shaaNDa|शाण्ड
शाण्ड,<BR> ‘descendant of Śaṇḍa,’ is the name of a man in the Rigveda 1) vi. 63, 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158. who is praised for his generosity. It is not likely that he is identical with Purupanthā mentioned in the next verse.

shaaNDila|शाण्डिल
शाण्डिल,<BR> masc. plur., is the term applied to the ‘descendants of Śāṇḍilya’ in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (i. 22, 10).

shaaNDiliiputra|शाण्डिलीपुत्र
शाण्डिली-पुत्र,<BR> ‘pupil of a female descendant of Śaṇḍila,’ is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Rāthītarīputra, in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) vi. 4, 32 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 5, 2 Kāṇva).

shaaNDilya|शाण्डिल्य
शाण्डिल्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Śaṇḍila,’ is the patronymic of several teachers (see Udara and Suyajña). The most important Śāṇḍilya is the one cited several times as an authority in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) ix. 4, 4, 17; 5, 2, 15; x. 1, 4, 10; 4, 1, 11; 6, 3, 5; 5, 9. Cf. Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iii. 11, 4. where his Agni, or ‘sacrificial fire,’ is called Śāṇḍila. 2) ix. 1, 1, 43; 3, 3, 18; 5, 1, 61, 68, etc. From this it appears clearly that he was one of the great teachers of the fire ritual which occupies the fifth and following books of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. In the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) at the end of the tenth book 3) x. 6, 5, 9. he is given as a pupil of Kuśri and a teacher of Vātsya; another list at the end of the last book in the Kāṇva recension 4) vi. 5, 4. gives him as a pupil of Vātsya, and the latter as a pupil of Kuśri. In the confused and worthless 5) Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xxxiv. n. 2. lists of teachers at the end of the second and fourth books of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad he is said to be the pupil of various persons--Kaiśorya Kāpya, 6) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 (Mādhyaṃdina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Kāṇva). Vaiṣṭapureya, 7) ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 26 Mādhyaṃdina. Kauśika, 8) ii. 6, 1; iv. 6, 1 Kāṇva. Gautama, 9) ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 26 (Mādhyaṃdina = ii. 6, 1; iv. 6, 1 Kāṇva). Baijavāpa, 10) ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 26 Mādhyaṃdina. and Āṇa bhimlāta. 11) ii. 6, 2 Kāṇva. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xxxi et seq.; 43, xviii et seq.; Weber, Indian Literature, 71, 76 et seq.; 120, 131, 132; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 213. No doubt different Śāṇḍilyas may be meant, but the lists are too confused to claim serious consideration.

shaaNDilyaayana|शाण्डिल्यायन
शाण्डिल्यायन,<BR> ‘descendant of Śāṇḍilya,’ is the patronymic of a teacher in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) ix. 5, 1, 64. Apparently he is identical with Celaka, also mentioned in that text; 2) x. 4, 5, 3. The name Śāṇḍilyāyana, like that of Sāṇḍilya, is common in the Sūtras. See Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 45, et seq. it is thus reasonable to suppose that Cailaki Jīvala 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 1, 34. was his son. It is much more doubtful whether he was 4) Weber, op. cit., 1, 259. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 53, 76, 120. the grandfather of Pravāhaṇa Jaivala, who was a prince rather than a Brahmin.

shaataparNeya|शातपर्णेय
शात-पर्णेय<BR> ‘descendant of Śataparṇa,’ is the patronymic of Dhīra in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (x. 3, 3, 1).

शाप<BR> in the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 5; x. 28, 4. and later 2) Av. iii. 24, 3; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 11. denotes the ‘drift’ brought down by streams, possibly conceived as the ‘curse’ of the waters. 3) Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 178; Vedische Studien, 3, 184, 185.

shaamulya|शामुल्य
शामुल्य<BR> in the marriage hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 85, 29. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 262. denotes a collen garment’ worn at night. 

shamuula|शमूल
शमूल<BR> in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 1) i. 38, 4. Cf. Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 116, 233; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ix. 4, 7; Kauśika Sūtra, lxix. 3. seems to have much the same sense as Śāmulya, ‘a woollen shirt,’ generally. Roth 2) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, ccxliii. emends to śamīla, ‘pieces of Śamī wood.’

shaamba|शाम्ब
शाम्ब<BR> See Śārkarākṣa.

shaambara|शाम्बर
शाम्बर,<BR> properly an adjective in the sense of ‘relating to Śambara,’ appears in one passage of the Rigveda (iii. 47, 4) to be used as a substantive denoting ‘the contest with Śambara.’

shaambu|शाम्बु
शाम्बु<BR> occurs in the plural with the Aṅgirases in a passage of the Atharvaveda, 1) xix. 39, 5, where Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 960, retracts the emendation Bhṛgubhyaḥ for Śāmbubhyaḥ in the text. no doubt as the name of a family of ancient teachers. There is extant in manuscript a Gṛhya Sūtra of the Śāmbavyas. 2) Oldenberg, Indische Studien, 15, 4, 154. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 678.

shaayasthi|शायस्थि
शायस्थि<BR> is the name of a teacher in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien. 4, 372.

shaarada|शारद
शारद<BR> See Pur.

shaari|शारि
1. Śāri occurs in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 12, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 14; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 33. It seems clear, since it is described as ‘of human speech’ (puruṣa-vāc), that it was some kind of bird, possibly the later Sārikā (‘starling’), as Zimmer 2) Altindisches Leben, 90, 91. suggests. See also Śāriśākā. 

shaari|शारि
2. Śāri, occurring in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 112, 16. is said by Sāyaṇa to mean ‘arrow.’ This is uncertain, but connexion with Śara or 1. Śāri is quite possible. 2) Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 103.

shaarishaakaa|शारिशाका
शारिशाका<BR> is an utterly obscure expression found in one passage of the Atharvaveda. 1) iii. 14, 5. Weber 2) Indische Studien, 17, 246. thinks it means ‘dung (śakan) of the Śāri bird’; Grill 3) Hundert Lieder,^2 112. sees in the word the śārikā, ‘the hooded crow’; Roth 4) In Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 110. suggests the emendation (śāriḥ (= śāliḥ) śaka iva, ‘like rice in manure’; and Bloomfield 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 351. But see Lanman's note in Whitney, loc. cit. emends śāri-śukeva, ‘like starlings and parrots.’

shaarkaraaxa|शार्कराक्ष
शार्कराक्ष<BR> is found in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. as the patronymic of a teacher, Śāmba, perhaps by a blunder for Śārkarākṣya, ‘descendant of Śarkarākṣa.’ In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 2) xxii. 8. a teacher, Śarkarākhya, occurs, again probably a blunder, in this case for Śarkarākṣa himself. The patronymic Śārkarākṣi is found in the Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra. 3) xii. 10. 10.

shaarkaraaxya|शार्कराक्ष्य
शार्कराक्ष्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Śarkarākṣa,’ is the patronymic of Jana in the Śatapatha Brāhmana 1) x. 6, 1, 1. and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 2) v. 11, 1; 15, 1. In the plural they occur in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka 3) ii. 1, 4. and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka. 4) Indische Studien, 4, 382. Cf. Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 204; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 388; 3, 259. It is not necessary to assume that the form is incorrect for Śārkarākṣa.

shaarga|शार्ग
शार्ग<BR> is the name of a bird in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 19, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 14; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 33. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93. Sāyana on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā calls it the ‘wild Caṭaka.’ 

shaarnga|शार्ङ्ग
शार्ङ्ग<BR> --The Anukramaṇī 1) See also Sāyaṇa on Rv. x. 142; Ṣaḍguruśiṣya on the Sarvānukramaṇī (ed. Macdonell), p. 163. (Index) of the Rigveda ascribes a hymn of that text 2) x. 142. to the Śārṅgas, Jaritṛ, Droṇa, Sārisṛkva, and Stambamitra. The Mahābhārata 3) i. 8334 et seq. contains a tale describing how the four Śārṅgas, sons of the Ṛṣi Mandapāla, were saved from the great fire in the Khāṇḍava forest by means of prayers. Sieg 4) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 44-50. has attempted to use this tale for the elucidation of the hymn in question, but without substantial success. As Oldenberg 5) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 39, 79. says, the tale is based on the hymn rather than vice versa.

shaarduula|शार्दूल
शार्दूल,<BR> ‘tiger,’ is mentioned in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 11, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 10; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 11; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 30. and the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 5, 3; iv. 1, 9, 11; 5, 4, 10; xi. 8, 4, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 8, 1; 8, 5, 2; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, i. 2, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 79. Cf. Vyāghra.

shaaryaata|शार्यात
शार्यात,<BR> perhaps ‘descendant of Śaryāta,’ is the name of a singer in the Rigveda. 1) i. 51, 12; iii. 51, 7. A Śāryāta appears also in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 2) iv. 32, 7. with the patronymic Mānava as the seer of a Rigvedic hymn, 3) x. 92. and as having been anointed by Cyavana. 4) viii. 21, 4. The same man is evidently meant by Śaryāta in the story of Cyavana in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5) iv. 1, 5, 1 et seq. and the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa. 6) iii. 121 et seq. (Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society) 11, cxlv.; Hopkins, ibid., 26, 58. In both these passages the Śāryātas are mentioned as his descendants, and his daughter is called Śāryātī.

shaalankaayana|शालङ्कायन

shaalankaayaniiputra|शालङ्कायनीपुत्र
शालङ्कायनी-पुत्र,<BR> ‘son of a female descendant of Śalaṅku,’ is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Vārṣagaṇīputra in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 4, 31).

shaalaa|शाला
शाला<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 31, 5; vi. 106, 3; viii. 6, 10; ix. 3, 1 et seq.; xiv. 1, 63. and later 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 3, 1; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 1, 6, etc. denotes a ‘house’ in the wide sense of the word, including such meanings as ‘stall’ for cattle, ‘shed’ for corn, etc. 3) Av. iii. 12, 1 et seq., and cf. ix. 3, 1 et seq. See Gṛha. The householder is called Śālā-pati, ‘lord of the house,’ in the Atharvaveda. 4) ix. 3, 12.

shaalaavatya|शालावत्य
शालावत्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Śalāvant,’ is the patronymic of Śilaka in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (i. 8, 1), and of Galūnasa Ārkṣākāyaṇa in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (i. 38, 4).

It is either the ‘crocodile,’ the ‘alligator,’ 3) Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 325, and Sāyaṇa on Rv., loc. cit.; Av., loc. cit.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, loc. cit. or the ‘porpoise’ 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. śiśumāra; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 157; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 624. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 96; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 179. (Delphinus Gangeticus).

shikya|शिक्य
शिक्य<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 3, 6, where Whitney suggests that it may be an ornamental hanging appendage. See Lanman in Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 526. Whitney's alternative rendering ‘slings’ is better. See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 597. Cf. perhaps Av. xiii. 4, 8. and later 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 4, 2. 3; 6, 9, 1, etc. seems to mean a carrying ‘sling’ of rope. 3) This is pretty clearly the meaning in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 4, 28; vi. 7, 1, 16. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 268, n. 3.

shikha|शिख
शिख<BR> and Anuśikha are the names of two priests who served as Neṣṭṛ and Potṛ at the snake festival in the Pañca- viṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

shikhaNDa|शिखण्ड
शिखण्ड<BR> denotes a ‘tuft’ or ‘lock,’ as a mode of wearing the hair, in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 3, 16, 2 (in the plural); catuḥ-śikhaṇḍa, Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 1, 27; iii. 7, 6, 4 (corresponding to catuḥ-kaparda, Rv. x. 114, 3). So śikhaṇḍin means ‘wearing a tuft of hair,’ and is found in Av. iv. 37, 7; xi. 2, 12, etc. 

shikhaNDinyaaJNasena|शिखण्डिन्याज्ञसेन
शिखण्डिन् याज्ञसेन<BR> (‘descendant of Yajñasena’) is mentioned in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (vii. 4) as a priest of Keśin Dālbhya.

Wearing the top-knot unloosened was the sign of mourning in the case of women and men alike. 2) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 2, 9. Cf. Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 11, 340; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 634, on Av. ix. 9, 7.

shigru|शिग्रु
शिग्रु<BR> is the name of a tribe occurring in the passage of the Rigveda, 1) vii. 18, 19. in which they are mentioned with the Ajas and the Yakṣus as having been defeated by the Tṛtsus and King Sudās. It is impossible to say whether they were or were not under the leadership of Bheda, as Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173. plausibly suggests. If Sigru is connected with the later śigru, ‘horse-radish’ (Moringa pterygosperma), which is quite probable, it is possible that the tribe was totemistic and non-Āryan, but this is a mere matter of conjecture. 3) Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 85; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 153; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, cliv; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 929 et seq.; Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 200, n. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 127. The Matsyas (‘Fishes’) were probably Āryan.

shinjaara|शिञ्जार
शिञ्जार<BR> is the name of a Ṛṣi twice mentioned in the Rigveda 1) viii. 5, 25; x. 40, 7. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 3, 139. along with Kaṇva, Priyamedha, Upastuta, and Atri. Geldner 2) Rigveda, Glossar, 179. takes the word either as a name of Atri or an adjective. 

shitikaxii|शितिकक्षी
शिति-कक्षी<BR> in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) v. 5, 20, 1. Cf. Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 4; Av. v. 23, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93. is explained by Sāyaṇa as a ‘white-breasted’ (pāṇḍarodara) vulture. The word may, however, well be only an adjective.^2

shitipRShTha|शितिपृष्ठ
शिति-पृष्ठ<BR> (‘white-backed’) is the name of the Maitrāvaruṇa priest at the snake festival in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

shitibaahuaiShakRtanaimishi|शितिबाहुऐषकृतनैमिशि
शिति-बाहु ऐषकृत नैमिशि<BR> is mentioned as a sacrificer in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, 1) i. 363 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 192). where it is recorded that a monkey an off with his sacrificial cake.

shipraa|शिप्रा
शिप्रा<BR> is a word of somewhat uncertain sense: it seems to mean ‘cheeks’ in several passages; 1) Rv. iii. 32, 1; v. 36, 2; viii. 76, 10; x. 96, 9; 105, 5, all according to Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Geldner. Rigveda, Glossar, 179, who treats the word as a neuter (śipra), takes it in i. 101, 10, as ‘lip’ (cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 249, n.), and sees in iii. 32, 1; viii. 76, 10; x. 96, 9, the sense of ‘moustache.’ Yāska, Nirukta, vi. 17, gives the alternative senses of ‘jaw’ and ‘nose.’ in others 2) Rv. v. 54, 11; viii. 7, 25. Geldner, loc. cit., here accepts śiprā as ‘helmet.’ it appears to designate the ‘cheek-pieces’ of a helmet, or of the ‘bit’ 3) Rv. i. 101, 10; Zimmer, loc. cit. of a horse. In ayaḥ-śipra, used of the Aśvins, 4) Rv. iv. 37, 4. and the other compounds, hiraṇya-śipra, 5) Rv. ii. 34, 3. hari-śipra, 6) Rv. x. 96, 4. and hiri-śipra, 7) Rv. ii. 2, 3; vi. 25, 9. the word probably has the extended sense of ‘helmet,’ described as ‘of iron,’ ‘of gold,’ or ‘yellow,’ Similarly śiprin 8) Rv. i. 29, 2; 81, 4; vi, 44, 14, etc. Cf. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 301; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 39, n. 2. would mean ‘wearing a helmet.’

shiphaa|शिफा
शिफा<BR> is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 104, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 18; Perry, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 11, 201. where Sāyaṇa explains the word as the name of a river, quite a possible interpretation.

shibi|शिबि
शिबि,<BR> son of Uśīnara, is mentioned in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra 1) xxi. 18. Cf. Caland, U7ber das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 28. as a protégé of Indra, who sacrificed for him on the Varṣiṣṭhīya plain, and saved him from fear of foreign invasion.

shimida|शिमिद
शिमिद,<BR> occurring in the Rigveda 1) vii. 50, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 394. in the compound a-śinida, perhaps denotes a disease. The feminine form, Śimidā, is found as the name of a demoness in the Atharvaveda 2) iv. 25, 4. and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 3) vii. 4, 1, 27. Cf. Śipada.

shimbala|शिम्बल
शिम्बल<BR> in the Rigveda 1) iii. 53, 22. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 179; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 254. denotes, according to Sāyaṇa, the flower of the Śālmali (= Śalmali), ‘silk-cotton tree.’ 

shimyu|शिम्यु
शिम्यु<BR> occurs in the Rigveda 1) vii. 18, 5. as the name of one of the peoples or kings who were defeated by Sudās in the Dāśarājña (‘battle of the ten kings’). Since in another passage 2) i. 100, 18, where Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., thinks that the word simply means ‘enemy.’ the Śimyus are coupled with the Dasyus, Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 118, 119. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 261. plausibly concludes that they were non-Āryans.

shirimbiTha|शिरिम्बिठ
शिरिम्बिठ<BR> occurs in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) x. 155, 1. where the name of a man may possibly be meant, the Anukramaṇī (Index) ascribing the hymn in which the word occurs to his authorship. Yāska, 2) Nirukta, vi. 30. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 167. however, renders the term by ‘cloud.’

shilakashaalaavatya|शिलकशालावत्य
शिलक शालावत्य<BR> (‘descendant of Śalāvant’) is the name of a teacher, a contemporary of Calkitāyana Dālbhya and Pravāhaṇa Jaivala, in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (i. 8, 1).

shiva|शिव
शिव<BR> as the name of a people occurs once in the Rigveda, 1) vii. 18, 7. where they share with the Alinas, Pakthas, Bhalānases, and Viṣāṇins the honour of being defeated by Sudās, not of being, as Roth 2) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des Veda, 95 et seq.; once accepted by Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 126. thought, his allies. There can hardly be any doubt of their identity with the  3) Arrian, Indica, v. 12. or  4) Diodorus, xvii. 96. of the Greeks, who dwelt between the Indus and the Akesines (Asiknī) in Alexander's time. The village of Śiva-pura, mentioned by the scholiast on Pāṇini 5) iv. 2, 109. Connected with Śiva by Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 376. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Zimmer, op. cit., 431; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 260 et seq. as situated in the northern country, may also perserve the name.

shishuka|शिशुक
शिशुक<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 14, 3. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 291. seems to be an adjective meaning ‘young,’ but according to Bloomfield 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 464. it has the sense of ‘foal.’ The commentator, Sāyaṇa, reads Śuśuka, which he explains as a ‘wild animal so called.’ Cf. Āśuṃga.

shishumaara|शिशुमार
1. Śiśumāra. See Śiṃśumāra.

shishumaara|शिशुमार
2. Śiśumāra is a term applied to Śarkara in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 5, 15), where he is called a Śiśumārarṣi, explained by the commentator to mean a Ṛṣi in the form of a Siśumāra.

sishnadeva|सिश्नदेव
सिश्न-देव,<BR> occurring twice in the Rigveda 1) vii. 21, 5; x. 99, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 118; Hopkins, Religions of India, 150; von Schroeder, Vienna Oriental Journal, 9, 237; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 155; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1911, 1002, n. 5. in the plural, means ‘those who have the phallus for a deity.’ The term most probably refers to the phallus worship of the aborigines.

शीष्ट<BR> occurs only in a Vālakhilya hymn of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 53, 4. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. where the word seems to be the name of an unimportant clan. 

shuka|शुक
शुक,<BR> ‘parrot,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) i. 50, 12. where a desire is expressed to transfer to the Śuka and the Ropaṇākā the yellowness of jaundice. The bird is included in the list of sacrificial victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 12, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 14; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 33; and cf. śukababhru, ‘reddish, like a parrot,’ ibid., xxiv. 2. It is described as yellow and as ‘of human speech’ (puruṣa-vāc). 3) Taittirīya and Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitās, loc. cit. According to Bloomfield, 4) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 352. this word is the correct reading for the second half of the obscure Śāriśākā of the Atharvaveda. 5) iii. 14, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 90.

shuktiaangirasa|शुक्तिआङ्गिरस
शुक्ति आङ्गिरस<BR> (‘descendant of Aṅgiras’) is the name of the seer of a Sāman or Chant in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xii. 5, 16).

shukra|शुक्र
1. Śukra, according to Tilak, 1) Orion, 162. has in two passages of the Rigveda 2) iii. 32, 2; ix. 46, 4. the sense of a planet. This is most improbable. Cf. Manthin.

shukrajaabaala|शुक्रजाबाल
2. Śukra Jābāla (‘descendant of Jabālā’) is the name of a teacher in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 7, 7).

shuchivRxagaupaalaayana|शुचिवृक्षगौपालायन
शुचि-वृक्ष गौपालायन<BR> (‘descendant of Gopāla’) is the name of the priest of Vṛddhadyumna Abhipratāriṇa in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 1) iii. 48, 9 (Ganpalāyana in Aufrecht's edition). He is also mentioned in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā. 2) iii. 10, 4.

shutudrii|शुतुद्री
शुतुद्री,<BR> twice mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) iii. 33, 1; x. 75, 5; Nirukta, ix. 26. is the name of the most easterly river of the Panjab, the modern Sutlej, the Zaradros of Ptolemy and Arrian. 2) In Arrian's time the Sutlej flowed independently into the Rann of Cutch: Imperial Gazetteer of India, 23, 179. In the post-Vedic period the name of this river appears transformed to Śatadru (‘flowing in a hundred channels’). The Sutlej has changed its course very considerably within historical times. 3) Ibid. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 10, 11.

shunaHpuchCha|शुनःपुच्छ

shunaHshepa|शुनःशेप
शुनः-शेप,<BR> ‘Dog’s tail,’ is the name of a man with the patronymic Ājīgarti. According to a tale told in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) vii. 13-18. and the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 2) xv. 20, 1 et seq. Cf. xvi. 11, 2. he was purchased as a victim by Rohita, King Hariścandra's son, who had been promised by his father to Varuṇa as a sacrifice. He was actually bound to the stake, but was released in time through his supplications, supposed to be preserved in certain hymns of the Rigveda. 3) i. 24 et seq. Cf. v. 2, 7. He was adopted by Viśvāmitra, to whose advice he owed the inspiration to ask the gods to release him, and became his son as Devarāta, much to the annoyance of some of Viśvāmitra's sons, who in consequence were cursed by their father. The Rigveda, however, contains merely the statement of Śunaḥśepa's deliverance from peril of death by the divine help, and the Yajurvedas 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 1, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xix. 11. The story is not found in Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 1. simply say that he was seized by Varuṇa (perhaps with dropsy), 5) Cf. Varuna gṛhīta. Cf. Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 408 et seq.; 573 et seq.; Roth, Indische Studien, 1, 457; ii. 112 et seq.; Weber, Indian Literature, 47, 48; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 10-16; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 355 et seq.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 207; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 146; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1911, 988, 989. but saved himself from Varuṇa's bonds.

sumbala|सुम्बल
सुम्बल<BR> is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) xii. 5, 2. 3. The meaning of the word is uncertain: Harisvāmi in his commentary takes it to be ‘straw’; Eggeling 2) Sacred Books of the East, 44, 202, n. 3; comparing Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxv. 7, 12. suggests that dried cotton fibre or pods may be meant. In any case, some substance that easily catches fire is intended. 3) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

shulka|शुल्क
शुल्क<BR> in the Rigveda 1) vii. 82, 6; viii. 1. 5. clearly means ‘price.’ In the Dharma Sūtras 2) See Foy, Die Rönigliche Gewalt, 39 et seq. it denotes a ‘tax,’ a sense which is found by Muir 3) Sanskrit Texts, 5, 310. in a passage of the Atharvaveda, 4) iii. 29, 3. where śukla is read in the edition with great detriment to the sense. This correction is accepted by Bloomfield 5) Hymns of the Atharvida, 434. and by Whitney. 6) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 136. In another passage the same change made by Weber 7) Indische Studien, 17, 304. is not accepted by Whitney, 8) Op, cit. 253. and doubtfully by Bloomfield. 9) Loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 413.

Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93.

sushmiNa|सुश्मिण
सुश्मिण<BR> is a name of Amitratapana, a king of the Śibis, in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 23, 10). 

shuudra|शूद्र
शूद्र<BR> is the designation of the fourth caste in the Vedic state (see Varṇa). It is quite unknown in the Rigveda except in the Puruṣasūkta 1) x. 90, 12. See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 8 et seq. (‘hymn of man’) in the tenth Maṇḍla, where is the earliest version of the origin of the castes the Śudra for the first time appears. The Rigveda, on the other hand, knows Dasyu and Dāsa, both as aborigines independent of Āryan control and as subjugated slaves: it is reasonable to reckon the Śūdra of the later texts as belonging to the aborigines who had been reduced to subjection by the Āryans. Strictly speaking, the defeated aborigines must have been regarded as slaves, but it is obvious that, except on occasions when most of the men were slain, which may have occurred quite often, there must have remained too many of them to be used as slaves of individual owners. The villages of the aborigines must have continued to subsist, but under Āryan lordship and control: there may be this amount of truth in Baden Powell's theory, which practically traced all the early cultivating villages in India to Dravidian origin. On the other hand, the term Śūdra would also cover the wild hill tribes which lived by hunting and fishing, and many of which would acknowledge the superiority of their Āryan neighbours: it could, in fact, be applied to all beyond the pale of the Āryan state. This view of the Śūdra suits adequately the Vedic references to his condition, which would not apply adequately to domestic slaves only. The Śūdra is continually opposed to the Āryan, 2) Av. iv. 20, 4; xix. 32, 8; 62, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 30; xxiii. 30. 31; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 10, 2; vii. 4, 19, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, Aśvamedha, iv. 7; xvii. 5; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 8, 6; iii. 13, 1, etc. See also Ārya and Arya. In Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 3, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xx. 17; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxviii. 5, Sūdra is opposed to Arya. and the colour of the Śūdra is compared with that of the Āryan, 3) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 5; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 17. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 4, 4, 9; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 4, 25; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 4, 5; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 6, 7; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 4; Muir, op. cit., 1^2, 140; Mahābhārata, xii. 188, 5. just as his ways are so contrasted. 4) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 17, 3. 4; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 24. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 5) vii. 29, 4; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 439. in its account of the castes, declares that the Śūdra is anyasya preṣya, ‘the servant of another’; kāmotthāpya, ‘to be expelled at will’; and yathākāmavadhya, ‘to be slain at will.’ All these terms well enough describe the position of the serf as the result of a conquest: the epithets might have been applied to the English serf after the Norman Conquest with but slight inaccuracy, especially if his master had received a grant of jurisdiction from the Crown. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 6) vi. 1. 11. explains that even if prosperous (bahu-paśu, ‘having many cows’) a Śūdra could not be other than a servant: his business was pādāvanejya, ‘the washing of the feet’ of his superiors. The Mahābhārata 7) xii. 30, 7 (Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 73). The same text, xii. 294, 21 (ibid., 74, n.). insists on his duty of service. says out and out that a Śūdra has no property (na hi svam asti śūdrasya, ‘the Śūdra has nothing he can call his own’). On the other hand, just as in England the royal justice would protect the serf in life and limb, 8) Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law, 1, 350, 355, etc. so it appears that the slaying of a Śūdra involved a wergeld of ten cows according to both Baudhāyana 9) Dharma Sūtra, i. 10, 19, 1. and Āpastamba. 10) Dharma Sūtra, i. 9, 24, 3. It may, indeed, be held that this wergeld was only due in case of murder by another than the master, but such limitation is nowhere stated. In sacred matters the distinction between Āryan and Śūdra was, of course, specially marked. The texts 11) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 4, 2; iv. 2, 2, 14, etc. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xvi. et seq.; 26, 292. Cf. Hopkins, op, cit., 13, 73, 75, n. do not hesitate to declare that the upper castes were ‘all,’ ignoring the Śūdras; the Śūdra is prohibited 12) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxi. 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 3. So the sthālī, ‘cooking vessel,’ is to be prepared by an Āryan, Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 8, 3. from milking the cow for the milk required at the Agnihotra (‘oblation to Agni’); and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13) iii. 1, 1. 10. Cf. v. 3, 2, 2. forbids a man who has been consecrated (dīkṣita) for a sacrifice to speak to a Śūdra at all for the time, though the Śāṭyāyanaka 14) Quoted by Āpastamba, cited in the scholiast on Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, vii. 5, 7. The sense is not quite certain, but that given in the text seems reasonable. Cf. Weber, op. cit., 10, 11. seems to have relaxed this rule by confining it to cases in which the Śūdra was guilty of some sin. At the sacrifice itself the Śūdra could not be present in the śālā, ‘hall’; he is definitely classed in the Śatapatha Brāhmáṇa 15) iii. 1, 1, 10. See also Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 1, 6; Lévi La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 82. and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 16) vi. 1, 11. as unfit for ‘sacrifice’ (ayajñiya); and declared in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 17) xi. 10, where he therefore does not receive Karīras. not to be admitted to drink Soma. At the Pravargya (introductory Soma) rite the performer is not allowed to come in contact with a Śūdra, 18) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1, 1, 34. who here, as in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 17) xi. 10, where he therefore does not receive Karīras. is reckoned as excluded from a share in the Soma-draught. On the other hand, the Śūdra is one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda, 19) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 5; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 1, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 6, 2, 10. He is also present at the Rājasūya, Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 1. and a fight between an Āryan and a Śūdra, in which, of course, the former wins, forms a part of the Mahāvrata rite, being perhaps a precursor of the Indian drama. 20) Keith, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 64, 534. Other indications, however, exist, showing that it would be undesirable to ignore the real importance of the Śūdra, which again reminds us of the condition of the serf, who, though legally restrained, still gradually won his way to the rank of a free man. Rich Śūdras are mentioned in the early texts, 21) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 7, 10; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1, 11. Some of the kings' ministers were Śūdras; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 2, 2, with Sāyaṇa's note. just as Śūdra gahapatis, ‘householders,’ occur in the Buddhist texts, and Śūdra kings in the legal literature. 22) Foy, Die königliche Gewalt, 8; Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 83, 84. See Manu, iv. 61; Viṣṇu, lxxi. 64; perhaps Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 5. But see Roth's emendation, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, ccxliii. Sin against Śūdra and Āryan is mentioned; 23) Kāṭhaka Saṃhiṭā, xxxviii. 5; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 3, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xx. 17. prayers for glory on behalf of Śūdras, as well as of the other castes 24) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 7, 6, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xl. 13; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 48, On the other hand, the Śūdra uses magic just as an Ārya does, Av. x. 1, 3. occur; and the desire to be dear to Śūdra as well as to Āryan is expressed. 25) Av. xix. 32, 8; 62, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxvi. 2, etc. The Sūtras also, while they emphasize as general rules points earlier not insisted on, such as their inferiority in sitting, etc., 26) Gautama Dharma Sūtra, xii. 7; Āpastamba Dharma Sūtra, ii. 10, 27, 15, So he can be insulted with impunity, Gautama, xii. 13, and is punished for insult by mutilation, ibid., xii. 1; Āpastamba, ii. 10, 27, 14. their exclusion from the study of the Vedas, 27) Gautama, xii. 4-6. the danger of contact with them 28) Āpastamba, i. 5, 17, 1; ii. 2, 3, 4, etc. or their food, 29) Āpastamba, i. 5, 16, 2, etc. still recognize that Śūdras can be merchants, 30) Gautama, x. 60. Cf. x. 50-67 for an exhaustive account of the Śūdra's duties in theory. His relations to his master are those of mutual support. or even exercise any trade. 31) Viṣṇu, ii. 14. Moreover, the Sūtras 32) Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 4, 11. Rules to the contrary (e.g., Gobhila Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 2, 52) are for special occasions. See Weber, op. cit., 10, 74. On the other hand, criminal intercourse of a Śūdra and an Āryan woman is severely punished in the Sūtras. See Āpastamba, i. 10, 26, 20; 27, 9; Gautama, xii. 2. 3. permit the marriage of a Śūdrā woman with members of all castes. Though it was a reproach to Vatsa 33) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 6, 6. and to Kavaṣa 34) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 19, 1. that they were the sons of a Śūdrā and a Dāsī respectively, still the possibility of such a reproach shows that marriages of this kind did take place. Moreover, illicit unions of Ārya and Śūdrā, or Śūdra and Āryā, are referred to in the Saṃhitās of the Yajurveda. 35) Ārya and Śūdrā: Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 30; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 19, 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 13, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, Aśvamedha, iv. 8; Śūdra and Āryā: Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 31. This verse the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa no doubt deliberately ignores. The origin of the term Śūdra is quite obscure, but Zimmer 36) Altindisches Leben, 216, 435. points out that Ptolemy 37) vi. 20. mentions  as a people, and he thinks that the Brāhui may be meant. Without laying any stress on this identification, 38) The Brāhui are now held not to be Dravidian ethnologically, but TurcoIranian (Indian Empire, 1, 292, 310). It is suggested (ibid., 1, 382) that they represent the original Dravidian type, which in India has been merged in the Muṇḍā type; but this suggestion is invalidated by the fact that the Rigveda speaks of the Dasyus as anās, ‘noseless’ (cf. Dasyu, 1, 347, n. 7). a term admirably applicable to Dravidians, but ludicrous as applied to the TurcoIranian type. It is much more plausible to assume that the Brāhuis are a mixed race, which in course of time has lost most of its Dravidian features. On the relation of Dravidians and speakers of Muṇḍā tongues, the Vedic texts throw no light. it is reasonable to accept the view 39) See Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 85, 255; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda. 3, 212; Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 201, 202. Cf. von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 154, 155; Jolly, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 50, 515; Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 201 et seq., Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 54; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 73 et seq.

It is called varṣa-vṛddha, ‘swollen by rain,’ in the Atharvaveda, 3) xii. 3, 19. which shows, as Zimmer 4) Altindisches Leben, 238. Cf. Lanman in Whitney's Translation of the Atharvaveda, 686; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharavaveda, 649. says, that it was sometimes made of reeds, not of dry wood. 

shuula|शूल

The Śūla, as the weapon of Rudra, is not mentioned till the late Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 11. In the post-Vedic language the tri-śūla, or ‘trident,’ is the regular emblem of Śiva. Cf.

His family, the Śyāparṇas, appear in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 4) vii. 27. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 43, 344, 345; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 437 et seq.; Weber, Indisches Studien, 1, 215, 216. as a self-assertive family of priests whom king Viśvantara excluded from his sacrifice, but whose leader, Rāma Mārgaveya, induced him to take them back. In some way Śyāparṇa was connected with the defeat of the Pañcālas by the Kuntis. 5) Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 471.

shyaama|श्याम
श्याम<BR> (‘swarthy’) with Ayas (‘metal’) in all probability denotes ‘iron’ in the Atharvaveda 1) xi. 3, 7.

Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 241, 275. renders it as ‘canary seed.’

shyaava|श्याव
1. Śyāva is the name of a protégé of the Aśvins in the Rigveda. 1) i. 117, 24; x. 65, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 150; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 32. He may be identical with Hiraṇyahasta.

shyaava|श्याव
2. Śyāva is mentioned in the Rigveda 1) viii. 19, 37. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 161. as a generous donor on the Suvāstu river.

shyaava|श्याव
3. Śyāva in one passage of the Rigveda (v. 61, 9) seems clearly, as Sāyaṇa thinks, to denote Śyāvāśva.

shyaavaka|श्यावक
श्यावक<BR> is mentioned as a sacrificer and friend of Indra in the Rigveda (viii. 3, 12; 4, 2). He may be identical with 2. Śyāva.

shyaavasaayana|श्यावसायन
श्यावसायन<BR> is the patronymic of Devataras in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 40, 2). The form is perhaps an error for Śāvasāyana. 

shyaavaashva|श्यावाश्व
श्यावाश्व<BR> is the name of a man mentioned several times in the Rigveda. 1) v. 52, 1; 61, 5. 9 (Syāva, a short form of the name, is here used); 81, 5; viii. 35, 19; 36, 7; 37, 7; 38, 8. The Anukramaṇī (Index) assigns to him a series of hymns in the fifth, eight, and ninth books. 2) v. 52-61; 81; 82; viii. 35-38; ix. 32. In one of the hymns 3) v. 61. Śyāvāśva mentions, apparently as his patrons, Taranta (a son of Vidadaśva) and Purumīlha, as well as Rathavīti. On this hymn is based a legend found in the Bṛhaddevatā, 4) v. 49 et seq. See also Ṣaḍguruśiṣya on Anukramaṇī to Rv. v. 61 (ed. Macdonell, p. 117 et seq.); Sāyaṇa on Rv. v. 61, 17-19; Nītimañjarī in Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 50 et seq. that he was the son of Arcanānas, who was sacrificing for Rathavīti Dālbhya. The father was anxious to obtain the king's daughter for his son in marriage; but though the father was willing, his wife insisted on her son-in-law being a Ṛṣi. The father and son, repulsed, were returning home, when they met on the way Taranta and Purumīḍha, former patrons of the father. These showed him respect, while Taranta's wife, Śaśīyasī, presented Śyāvāśva with much wealth. The son was then fortunate enough to meet the Maruts in the forest, and praised them, thus becoming a seer. As a result the king himself ultimately offered his daughter to Śyāvāśva. Sieg 5) Op. cit.; 50-60. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 148. seeks to show that this legend is presupposed in the Rigveda; but it is difficult to accept this view, since the references in the Rigveda are very obscure, and Śaśīyasī is probably no more than an epithet. 6) v. 61, 6. The word is taken as an epithet by Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and by Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 27. That there is some Itihāsa at the back of the hymn is clear: what it is can hardly now be determined. Śyāvāśva's obtaining gifts from Vaidadaśvi is referred to also in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra. 7) xvi. 11, 7-9. His name occurs in the Atharvaveda 8) iv. 29. 4; xviii. 3, 15. in two lists of persons, of which the former includes Purumīḍha, the latter also Arcanānas and Atri. A Sāman is ascribed to him in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 9) viii. 5. 9. Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 27, n. 4, bases on this an improbable conjeciure that he was a Kṣatriya. and he is perhaps referred to in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka. 10) i. 11, 2. But cf. Sieg, op. cit., 61, n. 4, who takes the word adjectivally, as in Av. xi. 2, 18, Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xix. 33, 26. In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 11) viii. 5, 9. he is styled Ārcanānasa, ‘son of Arcanānas,’ and later 12) The Anukramaṇī calls him and his father Ātreya. In the passages from book viii. of the Rv., cited in n. 1, Atri is mentioned with him. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 126, 127; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 214; Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 354; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 359 et seq.; Lévi, Ea Doctrine du Sacrifice, 122. he is called Ātreya, ‘descendant of Atri.’

shyena|श्येन
श्येन<BR> is the name in the Rigveda 1) i. 32, 14; 33, 2; 118, 11; 163, 1; 165, 2, etc. of a strong bird of prey, most probably the ‘eagle’; later 2) Av. iii. 3, 4; vii. 41, 2; xi. 9, 9, etc. (as in post-Vedic Sanskrit) it seems to mean the ‘falcon’ or ‘hawk.’ It is the swiftest of birds, 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 7, 1; v. 4, 11, 1; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8. and a source of terror to smaller birds. 4) Rv. ii. 42, 2; Av. v. 21, 6. It is the strongest of birds, 5) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 14. and even attacks herds. 6) Rv. iv. 38, 5. This corresponds well enough with the eagle's known habit of carrying off young lambs. It watches over men (nṛ-cakṣas), 7) Av. vii. 41, 2. a reference, no doubt, to its lofty flight in air. It brings the Soma from heaven. 8) See Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 1-24, who cites all relevant passages. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 87, 88, who points out that the epithet ṛjipya, ‘flying upwards,’ applied to the eagle, appears as an actual name of the eagle in Iranian.

shrapayitR|श्रपयितृ
श्रपयितृ,<BR> ‘cook,’ is a term mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (i, 2, 2, 14).

shramaNa|श्रमण
श्रमण<BR> ‘mendicant monk,’ is first found in the Upaniṣads. 1) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 3, 22; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 7, in IndischeStudien, 1, 78. According to Fick, 2) Die sociale Gliederung, 39 et seq. anyone could become a Śramaṇa. For the time of Megasthenes this seems indicated by his evidence, which, however, refers only to the east of India, beyond the Madhyadeśa proper. 3) Strabo, xv. 1, 49, 60; Arrian Indica, xii. 8, 9. Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 27, 28, 129, 138. The Vedic evidence is merely the name and the fact that Tāpasa, ‘ascetic,’ follows it in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.

See Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 217 et seq. She already appears in the earliest Buddhist sculptures seated on a lotus between two elephants that pour water over her. This type of the goddess has survived down to the present day in India. Śreṣṭhin.

shrutakaxa|श्रुतकक्ष

श्रुत-सेन<BR> is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 5, 4, 3) and the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xvi. 9, 4) as one of the brothers of Janamejaya.

shruShavaahneya|श्रुषवाह्नेय
श्रुष वाह्नेय<BR> (‘descendant of Vahni’) Kāśyapa (‘descendant of Kaśyapa’) is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Devataras, in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 40, 1). It is much more likely that Śruṣa is a mere misreading for Śūṣa.

shruShTigu|श्रुष्टिगु
श्रुष्टि-गु<BR> (‘possessing obedient oxen’) is the name of a man in a Vālakhilya hymn of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 51, 1. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 140, 141; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 90.

shreNi|श्रेणि
श्रेणि<BR> means a ‘row’ or ‘line’ of birds, 1) Rv. v. 59, 7. or horses, 2) Rv. i. 126, 4. or chariots, 3) Rv. iv. 38, 6; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 14, 1. and so forth.

shreShThin|श्रेष्ठिन्
श्रेष्ठिन्<BR> occurs in several passages of the Brāhmaṇas, 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 30, 3; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxviii. 6; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv. 20. Bhaga is the Śreṣṭhin of the gods, Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 4, 10. where the St. Petersburg Dictionary assigns to the word the sense of ‘a man of consequence.’ It is, however, possible that the word may already have the sense of the ‘headman of a guild,’ the modern Seth. 2) Cf. Hopkins, India, Old and New, 168 et seq. There is a similar doubt in the use of śraiṣṭhya, 3) Av. i. 9, 3 = Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 5, 4, 2 = Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, v. 6 = Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 4, 3. See also for the word, Av. x. 6, 31; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 25, 8; vii. 18, 8; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 9, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 7, 1, 1; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 2, 6; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, ii. 6; iv. 15, 20, etc. The use of śraiṣṭhya is, on the whole, not in favour of the theory that it is a technical term. which is perhaps not merely ‘the foremost place,’ as usually assumed, but definitely ‘the presidency of a guild.’ Guilds are referred to in the Dharma Sūtras, 4) Gautama Dharma Sūtra, xi. 20, 21, etc.; Foy, Die königliche Gewalt, 14, n. 2, etc. and they play a considerable part in the Buddhist texts 5) Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 88 et seq. and the Epic. 6) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 81 et seq. But the Vedic evidence is inadequate to afford ground for positive assertion or denial of their existence or organization in Vedic times.

shrotriya|श्रोत्रिय
श्रोत्रिय<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 6, 37; x. 2, 20 et seq. and later 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiii. 4; xxviii. 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 25, 15; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 4, 5; xiii. 4, 3. 14; Taittirīya Upaniṣad, ii. 8, etc. Cf. mahā-śrotriya, ‘a great theologian,’ in Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 11, 1. denotes a ‘Brahmin learned in holy lore,’ ‘theologian.’

shrautaRShi|श्रौतऋषि
श्रौत-ऋषि<BR> 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 1, 6. or Śrautarṣi, 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 4, 5; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 9, 11. ‘descendant of Srutaṛṣi or Śrutarṣi,’ is the patronymic of Devabhāga.

shraumatya|श्रौमत्य
श्रौमत्य,<BR> ‘descendant of Śrumant,’ is the name of a teacher in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (x. 4, 5, 1).

shleShman|श्लेष्मन्
श्लेष्मन्<BR> means generally that with which parts of a thing are joined together (from śliṣ, ‘join’): with reference to a hide, 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 32, 6; Jaiminīya Upanisad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 17, 3; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 17, 4. ‘laces’ of some sort may be intended; to a chariot, 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 9. Cf. Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 1, 13, where a chariot (Ratha) is called śleṣmavant, ‘tied with ropes.’ ‘bonds’ or ‘cords’ are probably meant; and to wood, 3) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, vi. 12. Cf. the Upaniṣads, cited in n. 1, and Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, ii. 1, which looks like a bad secondary version of the passage in the Jaiminīya. ‘glue’ is perhaps the sense.

shloka|श्लोक
श्लोक,<BR> in the plural, is found enumerated after the Upaniṣads, and before the Sūtras, in the list of literary types given in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 6 (Mādhyaṃdina = iv. 1, 2 Kāṇva); 5, 11. In the Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2) iii. 10, 6. the Śloka-kṛt appears: he is rather the ‘poet,’ as Max Müller 3) Sacred Books of the East, 15, 69 renders it, than merely one who ‘calls aloud,’ as the St. Petersburg Dictionary explains the term. 4) In Av. v. 20, 7, the word has the sense assigned to it by the Dictionary. Exactly what is meant cannot be said: ‘verses’ generally may be intended, several kinds being preserved in the Brāhmaṇas and called Ślokas. 5) E.g., Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 3, 1, 5; 5, 4, 12; xiii. 7, 1, 15; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 22, 3: Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 3, 8; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxiv. 18, 4; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, viii. 1; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, i. 6, etc.

shloNya|श्लोण्य
श्लोण्य<BR> in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 1) iii. 9, 17, 2. Cf. śloṇa, ‘lame,’ Av. xii. 4, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 6, 7, etc. denotes ‘lameness,’ not ‘skin disease’ (tvag-doṣa), as explained by the commentator.

shvaghnin|श्वघ्निन्
श्व-घ्निन्<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 92, 10; ii. 12, 4; iv. 20, 3; viii. 45, 38. and the Atharvaveda 2) iv. 16, 5. clearly means a ‘gamester’ or ‘professional gambler.’ It may originally have denoted a ‘hunter.’ 3) Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 71.

shvan|श्वन्
श्वन्<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 161, 13 (where the sense is quite obscure); 182, 4; ii. 39, 4, etc. and the Atharvaveda 2) Av. vi. 37, 3; xi. 2, 2; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, viii. 8, 22, etc. is the word for ‘dog,’ the feminine being Śunī. 3) Av. iv. 20, 7 (catur-akṣī); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 5, 2, 10. The dog was a tame animal, 4) Rv. ii. 39, 4. and used to guard the house from thieves or other intruders. 5) Rv. vii. 55, 5. He was also employed in hunting the boar (varāha-yu), 6) Rv. x. 86, 4. but was no match for the lion. 7) Av. iv. 36, 6. A hundred dogs are mentioned as a gift in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in a Vālakhilya hymn. 8) Rv. viii. 55, 3. Elsewhere the dog is regarded as unfit for sacrifice, as being unclean, 9) Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 51, 4; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 4, 1, 4. and is driven away from the sacrifice. 10) Rv. ix. 101, 1. To eat dog's flesh was a last resort of despair and hunger. 11) Rv. iv. 18, 3. Later, śva-paca (‘dog-cooking’) denotes a degraded caste. The bones of the feast were given to the dog. 12) Av. vi. 37, 3. Cf. ix. 4, 16. Saramā figures in legend as Indra's faithful dog 13) i. 62, 3; 72, 8, etc. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 151. searching for the cows. Rudra is lord of dogs (śva-pati) in the Yajurveda; 14) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 28; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 13; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 5. the ‘dog-keeper’ (śvanin) is mentioned in the list of sacrificial victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the same Saṃhitā. 15) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 27; xxx. 7; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 3, 1, etc. Cf. śva-nī (‘dog-leader’), Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 5. The four-eyed (catur-akṣa) dogs of certain texts 16) Cf. Rv. x. 14, 10. 11; Av. xviii. 2, 11. 12: Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, vi. 3, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 4, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 1, 2, 9, etc. are, of course, mythological. 17) Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 165 et seq.; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 500, thinks that Yama's two dogs are the sun and the moon (cf. Divya Śvan). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 233: Hopkins, American Journal of Philology, 15, 154-163. Cf. Kurkura.

svapad|स्वपद्
स्व-पद्<BR> denotes a ‘savage animal,’ ‘beast of prey,’ in the Atharvaveda (viii. 5, 11; xix. 39, 4).

shvayatha|श्वयथ
श्वयथ<BR> in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) iv. 2, 1, 11 (of the eye, in a myth). means ‘swelling.’ Possibly śīyathu, the disease prevalent in Videha according to the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sutra, 2) ii. 5: Caland, U7ber das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 35, 36. was a kind of ‘swelling’ (? goitre). 

shvavarta|श्ववर्त
श्व-वर्त,<BR> ‘found in dogs,’ is, according to some manuscripts, the name of a species of worm in the Atharvaveda (ix. 4, 16). See Śavarta.

shvashura|श्वशुर
श्वशुर<BR> from the Rigveda onwards 1) x. 28, 1; 85, 46; 95, 4; Av. viii. 6, 24; xiv. 2, 26, etc. denotes the ‘father-inlaw’ of the wife; not till the Sūtra period does it include the ‘father-in-law’ of the husband. 2) Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 10, 46. The daughter-in-law (Snuṣā), in the normal case when the father-in-law was the head of the family to which her husband belonged in fact as well as in age, was bound to pay him all respect. 3) See Rv. x. 95, 4; Av. viii. 6, 24; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 12 (Indische Studien, 5, 260); Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 22, 7. So in Av. xiv. 2, 26, the daughter-in-law is to be ‘helpful’ to the father-in-law. When the old man had ceased to exercise control, she became mistress (samrājñī) over him and his wife. 4) Rv. x. 85, 46. See Pati. In the plural 5) Rv. x. 95, 12; Av. xiv. 2, 27; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, loc. cit. Or it may be a plural majestatis, but not a sign of polyandry. Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 515, 516. the word denotes the ‘parents-in-law.’

shvashruu|श्वश्रू
श्वश्रू<BR> denotes ‘mother-in-law’ of the husband 1) Rv. x. 85, 46; Av. xiv. 2, 26. as well as of the wife. 2) Rv. x. 34, 3. She, together with her husband, if he became unable to manage the family, 3) Rv. x. 85, 46. fell under the daughter-in-law's sway, but otherwise was entitled to regard. 4) Av. xiv. 2, 26. The gambler in the Rigveda 5) Rv. x. 34, 3. Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Vermandtschaftsnamen, 516. complains of his having lost the favour of his wife's mother as one of the misfortunes brought upon him by dicing.

shvaajani|श्वाजनि
श्वाजनि<BR> is the name of a Vaiśya in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 5, 2). 

shvaapada|श्वापद
श्वापद,<BR> like Śvapad, denotes a ‘savage animal’ or ‘beast of prey.’ It is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) x. 16, 6. in the Atharvaveda, 2) xi. 10, 8. and occasionally later. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 4, 10 (where the tiger, Śārdūla, is mentioned as the chief of them); xii. 2, 4, 16; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 4, 29; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 16, etc.

shvaavidh|श्वाविध्
श्वा-विध्<BR> (‘dog-piercing’) is the name of the ‘porcupine’ in the Atharvaveda 1) v. 13, 9. and later. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 20, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 14; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 56; xxiv. 33, etc. It is called ‘long-eared’ (karṇa). 3) Av., loc. cit. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 82. See also Śalyaka.

shvikna|श्विक्न
श्विक्न<BR> is the name of a people twice mentioned in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) xii. 8, 3, 7; xiii. 5, 4, 15. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 209, 210. in connexion with their king, Ṛṣabha Yājñatura. Cf. Śvaikna.

shvitra|श्वित्र
1. Śvitra (‘white’) is the name of a species of serpent in the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 27, 6 (where there is a variant citra); x. 4, 5, 13. and the later Saṃhitās. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 10, 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 13, 21, has in the parallel passage citra, probably by error. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 134. Perhaps Śvitra, in the lis of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 39, has this sense; but the St. Petersburg Dictionary explains it as ‘a certain domestic animal,’ or, generally ‘a white animal.’

shvitra|श्वित्र
2. Śvitra is found as an adjective in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xii. 11, 11) in the sense of ‘afflicted with white leprosy.’

shvitrya|श्वित्र्य
श्वित्र्य<BR> See Śvaitreya. 

shvetaketu|श्वेतकेतु
श्वेत-केतु<BR> Aruṇeya 1) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 2, 7, 12; 5, 4, 18; 6, 2, 1; xii. 2, 1, 9; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 7, 1; vi. 1, 1 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 2, 1 Kāṇva); Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 3, 1; vi. 1, 1; 8, 1. (‘descendant of Aruṇa’) or Auddālaki 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 3, 13; iv. 2, 5, 14. (‘son of Uddālaka’) is mentioned repeatedly in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. In the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 3) i. 1. he appears as Śvetaketu, son of Āruṇi, and as a Gautama. In the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 4) xxvi. 4. he is quoted as an authority on the vexed question of the duty of the Sadasya, or the seventeenth priest, at the ritual of the Kauṣītakins, to notify errors in the sacrifice; Āruṇi, his father, is also cited. He was a person of some originality, for he insisted on eating honey despite the general prohibition of the use of that delicacy by Brahmacārins or religious students. 5) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 4, 18. He was a contemporary of, and was instructed by the Pañcāla king Pravāhaṇa Jaivala. 6) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 1 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 2, 1 Kāṇva); Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 3, 1. He was also a contemporary of Janaka, of Videha, and figured among the Brahmin disputants at his court. 7) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 6, 2, 1 (it is to be noted that he came upon Janaka when travelling about with some other Brahmins: he was never settled in the Videha country, but was clearly a Kuru-Pañcāla, like his father); Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 7, 1, where he shares the usual fate of defeat in argument by Yājñavalkya. A story is told of him in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra: 8) xvi. 27, 6 et seq. The exact sense of kṛtsnake brahmabandhau vyajijñāsiṣi is not quite certain. But Āruṇi seems to assert the love of knowledge, not of material advantages accruing to the Purohita, to have been his concern in life. Jala Jātūkarṇya was lucky enough to become the Purohita of three peoples or kings, of Kāśi, Kosala, and Videha. Seeing this, Śvetaketu felt annoyed and reproached his father with his excessive devotion to sacrifice, which merely enriched and glorified others, not himself. His father replied, forbidding him to speak thus: he had learned the true method of sacrificing, and his ambition in life had been to discuss it with every Brahmin. All the references to Śvetaketu belong to the latest period of Vedic literature. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Āpastamba Dharma Sūtra 9) i. 2, 5, 4-6. should refer to him as an Avara, or person of later days, who still became a Ṛṣi by special merit. His date, however, must not be fixed too low, because the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa in which he plays so marked a part is certainly earlier than Pāṇini, and was apparently even in that grammarian's time believed to be an ancient work: hence 500 B.C. is probably rather too late than too early a period for Śvetaketu as a rough approximation to a date. 10) See on this, Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, 2, xxxvii et seq.; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xxxv et seq.; Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 360 et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 65; 13, 443; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 22 et seq. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 433; Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 421 et seq.; Oldenberg, Buddha, 397, n.

shvetyaa|श्वेत्या
श्वेत्या<BR> appears in the Nadī-stuti 1) x. 75, 6. (‘praise of rivers’) to be a stream, probably a tributary of the Indus. 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14, 15; udwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200, gives the form as Śvetī; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 184, gives both forms.

shvaikna|श्वैक्न
श्वैक्न,<BR> ‘king of the Śviknas,’ is the title of Pratīdarśa, who was, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) ii. 4, 4, 3. one of those who offered the Dākṣāyaṇa sacrifice. He also taught Suplan Sārñjaya the sacrifice: hence Weber 2) Indische Studien, 1, 209, 210. has inferred a connexion of the Śviknas and the Sṛñjayas.

shvaitreya|श्वैत्रेय
श्वैत्रेय<BR> occurs in two passages of the Rigveda, 1) i. 33, 14; v. 19, 3. where Sāyaṇa sees in the word the name of a man, a ‘descendant of Śvitrā.’ The first passage is almost identical with one in the sixth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda, 2) vi. 26, 4. where, however, Daśadyu appears alone without Śvaitreya. Ludwig 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 147. identifies Daśadyu with Śvaitreya (‘son of Śvitrī’), and considers him a son of Kutsa. 4) Cf. Rv. i. 51, 6; vi. 26, 3, 4. Bergaigne 5) Religion Védique, 3, 11. and Baunack 6) Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 35, 527. think he is really Bhujyu. Geldner 7) Rigveda, Glossar, 7, 8. considers that he was a bull used for fighting, the son of a Śvitrā cow, 8) Cf. śvaitarī, Rv. iv. 33, 1. but this is very doubtful, though the term śvaitreya is elsewhere applied to a bull. 9) Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 935. Śvitrya 10) Rv. i. 33, 15, where Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., takes śvitryam as the accusative of śvitrī. seems to have the same sense as Śvaitreya. Ṣ.

ShaNDa|षण्ड
षण्ड<BR> is the name of a priest at the snake festival described in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35. Cf. Kuṣaṇḍa.

ShaNDika|षण्डिक
षण्डिक<BR> is mentioned in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 1) i. 4, 12, where von Schroeder gives no variant. But ṣ and kh are constantly interchanged in manuscripts. as a contemporary of Keśin. Probably Khaṇḍika should be read as usual elsewhere. S.

saMrudh|संरुध्
सं-रुध्<BR> and Saṃ-likhita occur in the Atharvaveda (vii. 50, 5) as two technical terms, of unknown sense, used in dicing.

saMvatsara|संवत्सर
सं-वत्सर,<BR> ‘year,’ is repeatedly mentioned from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. i. 110, 4; 140, 2; 161, 13; vii. 103, 1, 7, etc.; Av. i. 35, 4; ii. 6, 1; iii. 10, 2; iv. 35, 4; vi. 53, 3, etc. It duration was, according to the concurrent evidence of the Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas, 360 days, divided into 12 months, being, no doubt, roughly a lunar synodic year, which, however, it exceeded in length by 6 days. 2) See Māsa. As a solar year it appears only in the Nidāna Sūtra 3) v. 12, 2. 5. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 284. of the Sāmaveda, where the sun is stated to spend 13(1/3) days in each of the 27 Nakṣatras. The year being obviously out of harmony with the solar year (whether sidereal or tropical), efforts were certainly made to effect an assimilation of the natural and the accepted year. As has been seen (see Māsa), the evidence goes strongly to show that the intercalation was not an easy matter in the Brāhmaṇa period, though there are traces of what may be regarded as a five-yearly or six-yearly intercalation. But there is no conclusive evidence that these periods were really observed. Zimmer, 4) Altindisches Leben, 369, 370, and cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. saṃvatsara, 2. indeed, considers that the evidence required is afforded by the lists of the years, which are sometimes enumerated as five: Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvatsara, Idvatsara, and Vatsara; 5) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxvii. 45. or Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvatsara, Iduvatsara, Vatsara; 6) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 7, 3, 4. or Saṃvatsara, Idāvatsara, Iduvatsara, Idvatsara, Vatsara; 7) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 4, 1. or Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvatsara, Anuvatsara, Udvatsara; 8) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiii. 15; xxxix. 6; xl. 6. or Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvatsara, Anuvatsara, Idvatsara. 9) Garga, quoted in the commentary on Jyotiṣa, 10. But it must be noted not merely that the names vary considerably, but that four only are mentioned in some places, 10) Saṃ-, Pari-, Idā-, Anu-vatsara, Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 13, 17; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 10, 1. in others 11) Idā-, Pari-, Saṃ-vatsara, Av. vi. 55, 3; Idu-, Pari-, Saṃ-vatsara, Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 7, 2, 4. three, in others 12) Saṃ-, Pari-vatsara, Av. viii. 8, 23; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, x. 80. two, and in yet others 13) Saṃ-, Pari-, Idā-, Anu-, Vatsara, Saṃ-vatsara, Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 15; Saṃ-, Pari-, Idā-, Idu-, Id-, Vatsara, Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iv. 19, 1. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 298, n. 1; Max Müller, Rigveda, 4^3, xxv, n. 1. six. Moreover, in none of these enumerations is there any reference to the names being connected with a system of intercalation. It is most probable that here we have no more that a mere series of priestly variations of Vatsara, based on the older and more genuine Saṃvatsara and Parivatsara as variants of the simple Vatsara, ‘year.’ The key to the invention of the series is probably to be found in passages like that of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 14) xvii. 13, 17. where the several Cāturmāsya (‘four-monthly’) sacrifices are equated with the different years. 15) Cf. Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 91; Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 12; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 24, 42. Particularly unjustifiable is the attempt of Zimmer to see in the two-year series a series of two years of 354 days each, with an intercalary month in the second; for the year of 354 days, as such, is not known to have existed before the Sūtra period. Zimmer 16) Op. cit., 366, 367; Tilak, Orion, 16 et seq.; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 145. also finds an attempt at intercalation in the famous 12 days in which the Ṛbhus are said to have slept in the house of Agohya. 17) Rv. iv. 33, 7. Cf. i. 110, 2; 161, 13. See on this legend, Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 133; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 236. He thinks that they represent twelve days added at the winter solstice to equate the lunar year of 354 days and the solar year of 366 days; and from the reverence paid in German antiquity to the ‘12 nights,’ he infers that this mode of intercalation is Indo-Germanic. 18) See Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 242 et seq.; 17, 223, 224; 18, 45, 46; Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1894, 809; Thibaut, op. cit., 10; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 308, 310; Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, xciv. There can be little doubt that this view is wrong, and that the 12 days are merely the ‘reflexion of the year’ (saṃvatsarasya pratimā) 19) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, vii. 15; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 9, 10; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 15. See also Atharvaveda, iv. 11, 11; Weber, Omina und Portenta, 388. in the sense that they represent the twelve months, and have no relation to chronology at all. A reference to the use of Saṃvatsara alone as the fifth year of the cycle is seen by Shamasastry 20) Gavām Ayana, 137, 138. in the peculiar dating of certain notices in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 21) ii. 12; iii. 1; xxvi. 18; xxx. 3. See also Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, i. 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 1, 1, 7. but this view is improbable. 22) Caland, U7ber das rituelle Sūtra des Bandhāyana, 36, 37, gives a much more reasonable explanation of the anomaly.

saMvaraNa|संवरण
संवरण<BR> is the name of a Ṛṣi mentioned in one passage of the Rigveda. 1) v. 33, 10. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 215. 

saMvargajitlaamakaayana|संवर्गजित्लामकायन
संवर्ग-जित् लामकायन<BR> is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Śākadāsa in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373.

saMvarta|संवर्त
1. Saṃ-varta occurs once in the Rigveda 1) viii. 54, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 141, 164. with Kṛśa as an ancient sacrificer. He may be identical with the next.

saMvartaaangirasa|संवर्तआङ्गिरस
2. Saṃ-varta Āṅgirasa (‘descendant of Aṅgiras’) is said in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) viii. 21, 12. Cf. Leumann, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 67 et seq. to have consecrated Marutta.

saMshravassauvarchanasa|संश्रवस्सौवर्चनस
सं-श्रवस् सौवर्चनस<BR> is the name of a teacher who, according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (i. 7, 2, 1), discussed a point of ritual with Tumiñja.

saMshraavayitR|संश्रावयितृ
सं-श्रावयितृ<BR> in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad (ii. 1) denotes the attendant who announces visitors, the ‘doorkeeper.’

saMshliShTakaa|संश्लिष्टका
सं-श्लिष्टका<BR> 1) Śāṭyāyanaka in Sāyaṇa on Rv. viii. 91. or Saṃśviṣṭikā 2) Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 221 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 29). is the name of an animal mentioned in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa and the Śāṭyāyanaka along with the Godhā.

saMsarpa|संसर्प
सं-सर्प<BR> See Māsa.

saMskandha|संस्कन्ध
सं-स्कन्ध<BR> (‘having the shoulders together’) is the name of a disease mentioned with Viṣkandha in the Atharvaveda. 1) xix. 34, 5, with Sāyaṇa's note. Whitney, 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 952. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 65, 391; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 283. however, thinks it is intended as an adjective implying the sense of ‘counteracting the disease Viṣkandha.’ 

saMhotra|संहोत्र
सं-होत्र<BR> occurs once in the Rigveda, 1) x. 86, 10. where Geldner 2) Vedische Studien, 2, 38. thinks the sense of ‘school,’ referring to a school of pupils of the ritual, is most appropriate.

saktu|सक्तु
सक्तु<BR> in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 4, 10, 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 21 et seq.; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 16; ix. 1, 1, 8 (cf. Gavedhukā), etc.; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 2 (cf. Apāmārga). Cf. Kuvala, Karkandhu, Badara: Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 4, 22, etc. denotes ‘coarsely ground meal,’ ‘groats,’ especially ‘barley meal.’ In the Rigveda, 2) x. 71, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238. where the word occurs only once, it seems rather to mean grain before it is winnowed by the Titaü. If the latter word, however, designates a ‘sieve,’ Saktu might still mean ‘groats,’ as opposed to fine meal.

sakhi|सखि
सखि,<BR> ‘friend,’ is common from the Rigveda 1) i. 164, 20 (of birds); iii. 43, 4 (of steeds); ii. 1, 9; v. 12, 5; vi. 75, 3, etc. onwards, 2) Av. v. 4, 7; 11, 9; 13, 5, etc. So sakhitva and sakhya, ‘friendship,’ are also common--e.g., Rv. i. 10, 6; iii. 1, 15; iv. 25, 2, etc., and Rv. 1. 178, 2; ii. 18, 8; vii. 22, 9, etc. both literally and metaphorically.

saghan|सघन्
सघन्<BR> is the name of a bird, perhaps ‘eagle’ or ‘vulture,’ in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) iii. 2, 1, 1. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 2) ii. 8, 6, 1; Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. (‘valture’), Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 88.

sangaprayogi|सङ्गप्रयोगि
सङ्ग प्रयोगि<BR> seems to be mentioned as a teacher in the Maitrāyaṇi Saṃhitā (iii. 1, 9).

saMgati|संगति
सं-गति<BR> in one passage of the Rigveda (x. 141, 4) seems to have the sense of Samiti, ‘assembly of the people.’ 

saMgava|संगव
सं-गव<BR> denotes the time when the grazing cows are driven together for milking. In the division of the day the word denotes the period before midday, ‘forenoon.’ It is found in the Rigveda 1) v. 76, 3. and often later. 2) Av. ix. 6, 46; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 11; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 9, 2; 5, 3, 1; ii. 1, 1, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 3, 9; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, ii. 9, 4; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 12, 4. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 112 et seq. Cf. Go and Ahan.

saMgavinii|संगविनी
सं-गविनी<BR> is found in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 1) iii. 18, 14. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 112, 113; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 362. where it is said that the animals of the Bharatas in the evening were at the Goṣṭha, ‘pasture,’ but at midday came to the Saṃgavinī, apparently a shed or an enclosure in which during the heat of the day they were milked.

saMgrahiitR|sangrahiitR|संग्रहीतृ|सङ्ग्रहीतृ
सं-ग्रहीतृ<BR> is found in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 9, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 4; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 5; iv. 3, 8 (as a Ratnin) in the Śatarudriya in the plural Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 4, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 13; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 26. and the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 3, 5; 9, 6; iii. 8, 5, 3; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii, 25, 6. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 1, 8; 4, 3, 23. He is an official who figures among the Ratnins of the king. The sense of ‘charioteer’ seems adequate for every passage, but Sāyaṇa 3) on Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 9, 2, and optionally on i. 8, 16; but as charioteer on i. 8, 15; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 10, 6. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 63, n. 1. in some passages inclines to think that the meaning is ‘treasurer’ of the king.

saMgraama|sangraama|संग्राम|सङ्ग्राम
सं-ग्राम<BR> denotes primarily, it seems, ‘assembly’ either in peace 1) Av. xii. 1, 56, where it is joined with Samiti. We might see in this passage, and that cited in n. 2, the technical name of the village assembly as opposed to the larger assemblies of the people, but there is no good warrant for so doing. or in war, 2) Av. iv. 24, 7, where saṃgrāmān is read; but the parallel passages (Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 7, 15, 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 16, 5) have saṃgrāmani. when it means an ‘armed band.’ Its normal sense in the Atharvaveda 3) v. 21, 7; xi. 9, 26. and later 4) Taittirīya Samhitā, ii. 1, 3, 1; 8, 4, etc. is ‘war,’ ‘battle.’ Little is known of Vedic warfare, but it seems to have been simple. A body of foot soldiers with charioteers composed every army, the two going together, 5) Rv. ii. 12, 8. and the foot soldiers being often overthrown by the charioteers, 6) Av. vii. 62, 1. Cf. Muṣṭihan who were doubtless the Kṣatriyas and their foremost retainers. Probably the foot soldiers bore little armour, and used only the bow for offence, as is suggested by the account that Herodotus gives of the Indian contingent of the army with which Xerxes invaded Greece. 7) Herodotus, vii. 65. The nobles, on the other hand, may have had cuirass (Varman), helmet (Śiprā), and hand-guard (Hastaghna) as a protection from the friction of the bowstring. On the car was the charioteer, and on his left the warrior (Sārathi, Savyaṣṭhā). Riding is never mentioned in war, 8) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 296, where he admits riding to be mentioned elsewhere; Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 3, 312. and would hardly have been suited to Vedic ideas, for the warrior mainly depended on his bow, which he could not have used effectively from horseback. The offensive weapon (Āyudha) was practically the bow; spear and sword and axe were very seldom used. Whether there was a strict tribal organization of the host, such as is once alluded to in the Homeric poems, 9) Ibid, ii. 362. and is also recognized in Germany by Tacitus, 10) Germania, 7. is uncertain (cf. Vrāta), but in the Epic relations (Jñāti) fight together, 11) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 193. and this rule, no doubt, applied more or less in Vedic times also. Cities were besieged and invested (upa-sad, pra-bhid), 12) Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 3, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 4, 3-5; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 23, 2, etc.; Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 7; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 300, n. probably as a rule by blockade, since the ineffective means of assault of the time would have rendered storming difficult and expensive. Hillebrandt 13) Op. cit. 3, 289, n. thinks that the pur cariṣṇū of the Rigveda 14) viii. 1, 2-8, where it is attributed to the demon Śuṣṇa. was a kind of chariot; it may--like the Trojan horse--have been an Indian anticipation of the Roman means of assaulting a town. Besides ordinary wars of defence and conquest, raids into neighbouring territory seem to have been frequent and normal, 15) Cf. Rv. x. 142, 4, as interpreted by Sāyaṇa and by Hillebrandt, op. cit., 2, 64, n. 5; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 4, 1 (of the model Kuru kings). no doubt because of the booty (Udāja, Nirāja) which was to be won, and which the king had to share with the people. Banners (Dhvaja) were borne in war, and musical instruments (Dundubhi, Bakura) 16) So, later, Arrian, Indica, vii. 9. The shouts of either side are shown in the word krandas (Rv. ii. 12, 8; cf. vi. 25, 6; x. 121, 6), which came to mean the ‘shouting host.’ Cf. also Tacitus, Germania, 2. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 469472; Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1898, 564; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 293-301. See also Iṣu, Dhanvan, Ratha. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 281 et seq., gives a full account of the later Epic armour and warfare. See also his note, ibid., 15, 265, 266. For sacrifice in battle, cf. Purohita. were used by the combatants.

saMghaata|संघात
सं-घात<BR> seems in a few passages 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxix. 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 16; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 4, 18. to have the sense of ‘battle.’

sachiva|सचिव
सचिव<BR> ‘companion,’ ‘attendant’ (from sac, ‘follow’), later a common word for the comrade of a king, his minister, is found in Vedic literature in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 20, 1), where it is used by Indra of the Maruts. It seems to correspond in sense to the German comes or the English gesith. 1) Stubbs, Select Charters, 57.

sajaata|सजात
स-जात<BR> (‘born together’) is found once in the Rigveda, 1) i. 109, 1. and very often later. 2) Av. i. 9, 3; 19, 3; ii. 6, 4; iii. 3, 6; vi. 5, 2; 73, 1; xi. 1, 6, 7; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 3, 2; 2, 1, 2; 6, 9, 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 8; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 12, 13; xii. 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, v. 23; x. 29; xxvii. 5, and often in the Brāhmaṇas. The word must clearly mean a ‘relative,’ and then more widely a man of the same position or rank, but the senses cannot be distinguished, so much do they merge into each other. The Sajātas of a king are of course princes; 3) Av. iii. 3, 4. 6; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 188. of an ordinary man, Vaiśyas; 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 4, 19 (the Sajātas of a Grāmaṇī). of a military man, Kṣatriyas. But there is no clear reference to caste as in the later Sajāti 5) Manu, ix. 87; x. 41, etc. The abstract sajātya (‘kinship’) is found in Rv. ii. 1, 5; iii. 54, 16; viii. 18, 19; 20, 21; 27, 10; x. 64, 13; but even it has no definite caste reference. (‘man of the same caste’). The disputes of Sajātas were notorious. 6) Cf. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, 12, 2.

saMchara|sancara|संचर|सञ्चर
सं-चर<BR> in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1) v. 4, 3, 5. has the sense of the ‘path’ of animals. Normally it is the term designating the ‘passage’ or ‘space’ on the sacrificial ground used or occupied by the several persons taking part in the rite. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 9, 2, 4; iii. 1, 3, 28; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iii. 7, 11; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 3, 42, etc.

saMJNaana|संज्ञान
सं-ज्ञान,<BR> ‘concord,’ ‘harmony,’ is mentioned from the Rigveda 1) x. 19, 6. onwards 2) Av. iii. 30, 4; vii. 52, 1; xi. 1, 26, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 3, 2; 3, 1, 14; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxvi. 1; xxx. 9; Nirukta, iv. 21, etc. as a matter of great consequence; the Atharvaveda contains many spells to bring it about. The lack of peace in the Vedic village was almost inevitable in view of its small size and the economic interdependence of its inhabitants. Cf. Bhrātṛvya.

sata|सत
सत<BR> is the name of a vessel of some kind mentioned in the ritual. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 27, 88; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 7, 2, 13; 8, 3, 14.

satiinakankata|सतीनकङ्कत
सतीन-कङ्कत<BR> 1) The literal meaning seems to be ‘having a real comb.’ is, in the Rigveda, 2) i. 191, 1. the name of some animal, according to Sāyaṇa an ‘aquatic snake.’ 3) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98. 

satyakaama|सत्यकाम
सत्य-काम<BR> (‘lover of truth’) Jābāla (‘descendant of Jabālā) is the name of a teacher, the son of a slave girl by an unknown father. He was initiated as a Brahmacārin, or religious student, by Gautama Hāridrumata according to the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. 1) iv. 4, 1, et seq. He is often cited as an authority in that Upaniṣad 2) iv. 5, 1; 6, 2; 7, 2; 8, 2; 9, 10; 10, 1; v. 2, 3. and in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 3) iv. 1, 14 (Mādhyaṃdina = iv. 1, 6 Kāṇva). where he learns a certain doctrine from Jānaki Āyasthūṇa. 4) vi. 3, 19 (= vi. 3, 12). He is also mentioned in the Aitareya 5) viii. 7, 8. and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇas. 6) xiii. 5, 3, 1.

satyayaJNa|सत्ययज्ञ
सत्य-यज्ञ<BR> (‘true sacrificer’) Pauluṣi (‘descendant of Puluṣa’) Prācīnayogya (‘descendant of Prācīnayoga’) is the name of a teacher in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) x. 6, 1, 1. the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 2) v. 11, 1. and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 3) iii. 40, 2 (in a Vaṃśa, ‘list of teachers’). In the latter text he is said to have been the pupil of Puluṣa Prācīnayogya.

satyavachas|सत्यवचस्
सत्य-वचस्<BR> (‘true-speaking’) Rāthītara (‘descendant of Rathītara’) is, in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad (i. 9, 1), the name of a teacher who insisted on the importance of truth.

satyashravas|सत्यश्रवस्
सत्य-श्रवस्<BR> (‘of true renown’) Vāyya (‘descendant of Vayya’) is the name of a Ṛṣi in the Rigveda. 1) v. 79, 1 et seq. Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 156. thinks that he was the son of Sunītha Śaucadratha.

satyahavis|सत्यहविस्
सत्य-हविस्<BR> is the name of a mythical Adhvaryu, or sacrificial priest, in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (i. 9, 1, 5).

satyaadhivaakachaitrarathi|सत्याधिवाकचैत्ररथि
सत्याधिवाक चैत्ररथि<BR> (‘descendant of Citraratha’) is the name of a man in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (i. 39, 1). 

satvan|सत्वन्
सत्वन्<BR> in the Rigveda, 1) i. 133, 6; 173, 5; ii. 25, 4; 30, 10; iii. 49, 2, etc. and occasionally later, 2) v. 20, 8; vi. 65, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 8. 20, etc. has the sense of ‘warrior.’

satvant|satvat|सत्वत्|सत्वन्त्
सत्वन्त्<BR> is the name of a people who are stated in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) viii. 14, 3. to belong to the south. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) xiii. 5, 4, 21. the defeat by Bharata of the Satvants, and his taking away the horse which they had prepared for an Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’), are referred to: this reference clearly shows that in another passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 3) ii. 25, 6. the text must be altered from satvanām to Satvatām, ‘of the Satvants,’ against whom it seems the Bharatas made regular raids. The name has also been found by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, Cowell, and Max Müller in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, 4) iv. 1. but it is certain 5) Oldenberg, Buddha, 393, n., correcting Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 1, lxxvii. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 211, 212, 419; 9, 254; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 367. that the reading there is not Satvan-Matsyeṣu, but sa-Vaśa-Matsyeṣu.

sadaaniiraa|सदानीरा
सदा-नीरा,<BR> ‘having water always’ (‘perennial’), is the name of a stream which, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) i. 4, 1, 14 et seq. was the boundary between the Kosalas and the Videhas. The river is identified by the native lexicographers with the Karatoyā, 2) See Imperial Gazetteer of India, 15, 24. but this seems to be too far east. Weber's 3) Indische Studien, 1, 172, 181. identification of it with the Gaṇḍakī 4) See s.v. Great Gandak, Imperial Gazetteer of India, 12, 125. is probably correct; for though the Mahābhārata 5) ii. 794. Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 398, n. distinguishes the two rivers, there is nothing to show that this is due to any good tradition.

sadaapRNa|सदापृण
सदा-पृण<BR> is the name of a Ṛṣi in the Rigveda. 1) v. 44, 12. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 139.

sanaka|सनक
सनक<BR> occurs as the name of one of the two Kāpyas (the other being Navaka) who took part in the sacrifice of the Vibhindukīyas, which is mentioned in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa. 1) iii. 233 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 38). Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 147. thinks that the Sanakas are referred to as non-sacrificers in one passage of the Rigveda, 3) i. 33, 4. but this is very doubtful. 4) Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 189.

sanatkumaara|सनत्कुमार
सनत्-कुमार<BR> is the name of a mythical sage in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (vii. 1, 1; 26, 2).

sanashruta|सनश्रुत
सन-श्रुत<BR> (‘famed of old’) Ariṃdama (‘tamer of foes’) is mentioned as a Mahārāja in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (vii. 34, 9).

sanaachChava|सनाच्छव
सनाच्-छव<BR> is perhaps the proper name of a teacher in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. 1) xx. 1. The Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā 2) xxxi. 3 (von Schroeder, Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 2, 18, n. 5). has Śahanāśchiva. Very probably the reading of both texts is bad. 

sanaatana|सनातन
सनातन<BR> is the name of a mythical Ṛṣi in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 (Mādhyaṃdina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Kāṇva). he appears in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) as the pupil of Sanaga and the teacher of Sanāru, both equally mythical persons. ^1 iv. 3, 3, 1.

saMdaMsha|sandaMsha|संदंश|सन्दंश
सं-दंश<BR> See Gṛha.

saMdaana|sandaana|संदान|सन्दान
सं-दान<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 162, 8. 16. and later 2) Av. vi. 103, 1; 104, 1; xi. 9, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 7, 2; Sata patha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 3, 1, 22, etc. denotes a ‘bond,’ ‘halter,’ or ‘fetter.’

saMdhaa|sandhaa|संधा|सन्धा
सं-धा<BR> denotes in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas 1) Av. xi. 10, 9, 15; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 7, 8, 4; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 1, 6; ii. 1, 1, 3; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iii. 1. an ‘agreement’ or ‘compact.’

saMdhi|संधि
सं-धि<BR> denotes the ‘juncture’ of heaven and earth, the ‘horizon,’ in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 1) iii. 2, 1, 5; x. 5, 4, 2. It also has the sense of ‘twilight’ 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 25; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 5, 1; ii. 2, 9, 8; dual; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 55; ix. 4, 4, 13, etc. The later term is Saṃdhyā. as the juncture of light and dark.

saMnahana|sannahana|संनहन|सन्नहन
सं-नहन<BR> in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 1, 2, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 3, 6; ii. 6, 1, 15, etc. denotes a ‘band’ or ‘rope.’ 

sapatna|सपत्न
स-पत्न,<BR> ‘rival,’ is a common word in the later Saṃhitās, 1) Av. i. 19, 4; x. 6, 30; xii. 2, 46; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 2, 2; iii. 2, 8, 5, etc. being also found in the tenth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda. 2) x. 166, 1, etc.; also in the compound sapatna-kan, ‘slaying rivals,’ x. 159, 5, etc.; Av. i. 29, 5, etc. It is a curious masculine formed by analogy from Sa-patnī, ‘co-wife,’ and so ‘female rival.’

sapatnii|सपत्नी
स-पत्नी<BR> occurs in the Rigveda in the sense of ‘co-wife’; 1) iii. 1, 10; 6, 4. in the first and the last Maṇḍalas it means co-wife as a ‘rival.’ 2) i. 105, 8; x. 145, 1-5 (cf. in verse 2, patim me kevalam kuru, ‘make my husband exclusively mine’). In post-Vedic Sanskrit the word becomes a synonym for ‘rival.’

saptagu|सप्तगु
सप्त-गु<BR> is the reputed author of a Rigvedic hymn in a verse of which he is mentioned. 1) x. 47, 6. Cf. Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 17, 423.

saptasindhavaH|सप्तसिन्धवः
सप्त सिन्धवः,<BR> ‘the seven rivers,’ occur only once in the Rigveda as the designation of a definite country, 1) viii. 24, 27. while elsewhere 2) Rv. i. 32, 12; 34, 8; 35, 8; 71, 7; 102, 2; iv. 28, 1; viii. 96, 1, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxviii. 26; Atharvaveda, iv. 6, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 6, 1, etc. the seven rivers themselves are meant. Max Müller 3) Chips, 1, 63. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 490, n. thinks that the five streams of the Panjab, with the Indus and the Sarasvatī, are intended; others 4) Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200; Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 3; Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 3, 311. hold that the Kubhā should be substituted for the Sarasvatī, or that perhaps the Oxus 5) Cf. Thomas, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1883, 371 et seq. must originally have been one of the seven. Zimmer 6) Altindisches Leben, 21. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 278; India, Old and New, 33. is probably right in laying no stress at all on any identifications; ‘seven’ being one of the favourite numbers in the Rigveda and later. 

saptasuuryaaH|सप्तसूर्याः
सप्त सूर्याः,<BR> the ‘seven suns’ referred to in the Saṃhitās, 1) Av. xiii. 3, 10; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 9. are named in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 2) i. 7. Cf. the ‘seven tongues’ of Agni which are mentioned in the Rigveda, and each of which later receives an individual name: Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 89. as Āroga, Bhrāja, Paṭara, Pataṅga, Svarṇara, Jyotiṣīmant, and Vibhāsa, but these occur very rarely even later. 3) Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 266; Hopkins, Great Epic of India, 475. Weber at one time 4) Indische Studien, 1, 170; 2, 238. thought that the seven planets (see Graha) were meant by the phrase, but later he abandoned the idea. 5) Ibid., 10, 271, n., where he compares the sapta diśo nānā-sūryāḥ, ‘seven regions with various suns,’ of Rv. ix. 114, 3. Probably the ‘seven rays’ of the Rigveda 6) Rv. i. 105, 9; viii. 72, 16; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 277. are meant.

saptamaanuSha|सप्तमानुष
सप्त-मानुष<BR> is found in one passage of the Rigveda 1) viii. 39, 8. as an epithet of Agni, ‘belonging to the seven tribes.’ Hopkins 2) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 278. thinks that this is a reference to the seven ‘family’ books of the Rigveda (ii.-viii.), but this seems less likely than the view of Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. that saptamānuṣa is equivalent to vaiśvānara.

saptavadhri|सप्तवध्रि
सप्त-वध्रि<BR> is the name of a protégé of the Aśvins, who appear from several passages of the Rigveda 1) v. 78, 5; viii. 73, 9; x. 39, 9. to have rescued him from a tree in which he had got fastened. He is mentioned in the Atharvaveda. 2) iv. 29, 4. According to Geldner, 3) Rigveda, Glossar, 190. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 156; Baunack, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 50, 268. he is identical with Atri.

sapti|सप्ति
सप्ति<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 85, 1, 6; 162, 1; ii. 34, 7; iii. 22, 1, etc. and later 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 19, 22. denotes a ‘swift steed.’ 

saptya|सप्त्य
सप्त्य<BR> in one passage of the Rigveda (viii. 41, 4) seems to denote a ‘racecourse.’

sabandhu|सबन्धु
स-बन्धु<BR> (‘of the same kin’) in the Rigveda 1) iii. 1, 10; v. 47, 5; viii. 20, 21, etc. and later 2) Av. vi. 15, 2; viii. 2, 26; xv. 8, 2. 3, etc. denotes ‘related.’

sabhaa|सभा
सभा<BR> is the name of an ‘assembly’ of the Vedic Indians as well as of the ‘hall’ where they met in assembly. It is often mentioned in the Rigveda 1) vi. 28, 6; viii. 4, 9; x. 34, 6. Cf. sabhā-saha, ‘eminent in the assembly,’ x. 71, 10. and later, 2) Av. v. 31, 6; vii. 12, 1, 2; viii. 10, 5; xii. 1, 56; xix. 55, 6; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 7, 6, 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 7, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 45; xvi. 24; xx. 17; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 10, 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 2, 3; v. 3, 1, 10; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, vii. 9, etc. but its exact character is not certain. The hall was clearly used for dicing, 3) Rv. x. 34, 6; Av. v. 31, 6; xii. 3, 46 (here dyūta is used in place of Sabhā). presurnably when the assembly was not transacting public business: a dicer is called sabhā-sthāṇu, ‘pillar of the assembly hall,’ doubtless because of his constant presence there. 4) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 18; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 16, 1, with Sāyaṇa's note. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 172, inclines to see in the formula (Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 45; xx. 17; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 3, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, ix. 4; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 10, 2) ‘what sin we have committed in the village, the jungle, the Sabhā’ a reference to attacks on the great (Mahīdhara on Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 45), or partiality in deciding disputes (Mahīdhara, ibid., xx. 17). But it may refer to gambling or other nonpolitical activity, as Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 398, takes it, though he renders it differently, ibid., 44, 265. The hall also served, like the Homeric , as a meeting-place for social intercourse and general conversation about cows and so forth, 5) Rv. vi. 28, 6. Cf. viii. 4, 9. So in Av. vii. 12, 2, the assembly is hailed as nariṣṭā, ‘merriment.’ But the same hymn (vii. 12, 3) contains a clear reference to serious speech in the Sabhā. For the blending of serious political work and amusement, cf. Tacitus, Germania, 22. possibly for debates and verbal contests. 6) So Zimmer, op. cit., 174, takes sabheya in Rv. ii. 24, 13. According to Ludwig, 7) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 253256. He quotes for this view Rv. viii. 4, 9; x. 71, 10 (passages which are quite vague). Cf. also Rv. vii. 1, 4; Av. xix. 57, 2. the Sabhā was an assembly not of all the people, but of the Brahmins and Maghavans (‘rich patrons’). This view can be supported by the expressions sabheya, ‘worthy of the assembly,’ applied to a Brahmin, 8) Rv. ii. 24, 13. Cf. i. 91, 20; Av. xx. 128, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 22, etc. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 276, sees in sabheya the implication of ‘courtly manners,’ but this is rather doubtful; manner is not conspicuous in Vedic society as in Homeric. rayiḥ sabhāvān, ‘wealth fitting for the assembly,’ 9) Rv. iv. 2, 5; in i. 167, 3, sabhāvatī is applied to ‘speech,’ or perhaps to yoṣā, ‘woman.’ and so on. But Bloomfield 10) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 13. plausibly sees in these passages a domestic use of Sabhā, which is recognized by the St. Petersburg Dictionary in several passages 11) Av. viii. 10, 5 (where the sense is, however, clearly ‘assembly’; see viii. 10, 6); Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 8, 6; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 10, 3; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 14 (but here the sense is certainly ‘assembly hall,’; see v. 3, 6, where the king is described as going to the assembly hall: sabhā-ga) The exact sense given by the St. Petersburg Dictionary is the ‘society room’ in a dwelling-house. as relating to a house, not to the assembly at all. Zimmer 12) Altindisches Leben, 174. But he ignores Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 4, 14; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 3, 6, which show that the king went to the Sabhā just as much as to the Samiti, and he cannot adduce any passage to show that the Grāmaṇī presided. is satisfied that the Sabhā was the meetingplace of the village council, presided over by the Grāmaṇī. But of this there is no trace whatever. Hillebrandt 13) Vedische Mythologie, 2, 123-125. seems right in maintaining that the Sabhā and the Samiti cannot be distinguished, and that the reference to well-born (su-jāta) 14) Rv. vii. 1, 4. men being there in session is to the Āryan as opposed to the Dāsa or Śūdra, not to one class of Āryan as opposed to the other. Hillebrandt also sees in Agni ‘of the hall’ (sabhya) a trace of the fire used in sacrifice on behalf of the assembly when it met. 15) Agni is sabhya, Av. viii. 10, 5; xix. 55, 6. For the Rv., see iii. 23, 4; v. 3, 11; vii. 7, 5. Women did not go to the Sabhā, 16) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 7, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 172174. for they were, of course, excluded from political activity. For the Sabhā as a courthouse, cf. Grāmyavādin. There is not a single notice of the work done by the Sabhā.

sabhaachara|सभाचर
सभा-चर<BR> is one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 6; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 2, 1 with Sāyaṇa's note. Cf. Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 77, n. 1. The St. Petersburg Dictionary thinks it is an adjective equivalent in sense to sabhā-ga,’ ‘going to the assembly.’ As he is dedicated to Dharma, ‘Justice,’ it is difficult not to see in him a member of the Sabhā as a law court, perhaps as one of those who sit to decide cases: there is nothing to show whether the whole assembly did so, or only a chosen body. The special use of Sabhācara suggests the latter alternative. See also Sabhāsad.

sabhaapati|सभापति
सभा-पति,<BR> ‘lord of the assembly,’ is an epithet in the Śatarudriya. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 24; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 3, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 13, etc.

sabhaapaala|सभापाल
सभा-पाल<BR> is found in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 7, 4, 6), where the sense may be ‘guardian of an assembly hall.’

sabhaavin|सभाविन्
सभाविन्<BR> in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 4, 16, 1) denotes, according to the commentator Sāyaṇa, the ‘keeper of a gambling hall.’

sabhaasad|सभासद्
सभा-सद्,<BR> ‘sitter in the assembly,’ is probably a technical description of the assessors who decided legal cases in the assembly (cf. Sabhācara). The term, which is found in the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 29, 1 (of Yama); vii. 12, 2; xix. 55, 6. and later, 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, viii. 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 6, 11; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 1, 26; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 21, 14. cannot well merely denote any member of the assembly. It is also possible that the Sabhāsads, perhaps the heads of families, were expected to be present at the Sabhā oftener than the ordinary man: the meetings of the assembly for justice may have been more frequent than for general discussion and decision.

sabhaasthaaNu|सभास्थाणु
सभा-स्थाणु<BR> See Sabhā.

sabheya|सभेय
सभेय<BR> See Sabhā. 

samanka|समङ्क
सम्-अङ्क<BR> is a word of obscure sense occurring in two passages of the Atharvaveda. 1) i. 12, 2; vi. 50, 1. Bloomfield 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 7, 142. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. renders it ‘hook’ in the first, and takes it to mean an insect destructive of grain in the other.

samana|समन
समन<BR> is a word of somewhat doubtful sense in the Rigveda. Roth 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. renders it either ‘battle’ 2) Rv. vi. 75, 3. 5; ix. 96, 9; x. 143, 4; Av. vi. 92, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ix. 9. or ‘festival.’ 3) Rv. ii. 16, 7; vi. 60, 2; vii. 2, 5; viii. 12, 9; ix. 97, 47; x. 55, 5; 86, 10; Av. ii. 36, 1. Pischel 4) Vedische Studien, 2, 314. thinks that it was a general popular festivity to which women went to enjoy themselves, 5) Rv. i. 124, 8 (cf. Vrā); iv. 58, 8; vi. 75, 4; vii. 2, 5; x. 86, 10; 168, 2. poets to win fame, 6) Rv. ii. 16, 7; ix. 97, 47. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 38. bowmen to gain prizes at archery, 7) Rv. vi. 75, 3. 5. horses to run races; 8) Rv. ix. 96, 9; Av. vi. 92, 2. and which lasted until morning 9) Rv. i. 48, 6, which Roth takes as referring to men going to business. or until a conflagration, caused by the fires kept burning all night, scattered the celebrators. 10) Rv. x. 69, 11. Cf. vii. 9, 4. Young women, 11) Av. ii. 36, 1. elderly women, 12) Rv. vii. 2, 5. sought there to find a husband, and courtezans to make profit of the occasion. 13) Rv. iv. 58, 8, where, as in vi. 75, 4; x. 168, 2, Roth sees the sense of ‘embrace.’ The parallel with the festivals of Greece, where only young girls were able freely to mix with strangers, and which afforded the basis of so many of the comedies of the later school, is striking (cf. Mahaffy, Greek Literature, 1, 2, 259 et seq.). Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 190.

samara|समर
समर<BR> in the sense of ‘battle’ is found in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, 1) vii. 9; Sāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 15, 12. and, according to Geldner, 2) Rigveda, Glossar, 190. in the Rigveda. 3) vi. 9, 2 (at the sacrifice; cf. samarya, iv. 24, 8, etc.).

samaa|समा
समा<BR> appears originally to have denoted ‘summer,’ a sense which may be seen in a few passages of the Atharvaveda. 1) i. 35, 4; ii. 6, 1; iii. 10, 9. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 36. Hence it also denotes more generally ‘season,’ a rare use. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 25, 7; Nirukta, ix. 41. More commonly it is simply ‘year’; 3) Rv. iv. 57, 7; x. 85, 5; 124, 4; Av. v. 8, 8; vi. 75, 2, etc. but in one place the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 4) vi. 2, 1, 25. interprets it in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 5) xxvii. 1, with Mahīdhara's note. See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 168, n. 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 372; Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 301. as meaning ‘month,’ a doubtful sense.

samaana|समान
समान<BR> See Prāṇa.

samaanagotra|समानगोत्र
समान-गोत्र<BR> 1) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 15. and Samāna-jana 2) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 6, 9; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 2, 10. mean ‘belonging to the same family’ and ‘class’ respectively in the Brāhmaṇas. Samāna-bandhu, ‘having the same kin,’ is found in the Rigveda. 3) i. 113, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 1, 25.

samaanta|समान्त
समान्त<BR> (‘having the same boundary’), ‘neighbour,’ and therefore ‘foe,’ occurs in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (ii. 1, 24).

samiti|समिति
सम्-इति<BR> denotes an ‘assembly’ of the Vedic tribe. It is already mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) i. 95, 8; ix. 92, 6; x. 97, 6; 166, 4; 191, 3. and often later, 2) Av. v. 19, 15; vi. 88, 3; vii. 12, 1; xii. 1, 56, etc. sometimes in connexion with Sabhā. 3) Av. vii. 12, 1; xii. 1, 56; xv. 9, 2. 3; viii. 10, 5. 6. Ludwig 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 253 et seq. considers that the Samiti included all the people, primarily the viśaḥ, ‘subjects,’ but also the Maghavans and Brahmins if they desired, though the Sabhā was their special assembly. This view is not probable, nor is that of Zimmer, 5) Altindisches Leben, 172 et seq. that the Sabhā was the village assembly. Hillebrandt appears to be right in holding that Samiti and Sabhā are much the same, the one being the assembly, the other primarily the place of assembly. 6) Vedische Mythologie, 2, 124, n. 6. The king went to the assembly 7) Rv. ix. 92, 6; x. 97, 6 (where the reference is hardly to an oligarchy, as Zimmer, 176, 177, holds, but merely to the princes of the blood going to the assembly with the rest). just as he went to the Sabhā. That he was elected there, as Zimmer 8) Op. cit., 175, quoting Av. vi. 87, 88, with Rv. x. 173, and Av. v. 19, 15, with Av. iii. 4, 6. thinks, is as uncertain as whether he was elected at all (see Rājan). But there are clear signs that concord between king and assembly were essential for his prosperity. 9) Av. vi. 88, 3. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2, takes Samiti here and in v. 19, 15; Rv. x. 166, 4; 191, 3, to mean ‘union,’ but this is neither necessary nor probable. It is reasonable to assume that the business of the assembly was general deliberation on policy of all kinds, legislation so far as the Vedic Indian cared to legislate, and judicial work (cf. Sabhāsad). But of all these occupations there is, perhaps as a result of the nature of the texts, little or no evidence directly available. The gods had a Samiti, hence called daivī, ‘divine,’ 10) Rv. x. 11, 8. just as they had a Sabhā. 11) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, ii. 11, 13, 14. The assembly disappears as an effective part of government in the Buddhist texts, 12) Cf. Bühler, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 55, on the Parīsa. the Epic, 13) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 148-152, who traces the decay of the old assembly through the aristocratic war council and the secret priestly conclave. It is, of course, very probable that at no time was the Samiti a place where any or much attention was paid to the views of the common man. Princes and great men spoke; the rest approved or disapproved, as in Homeric times and in Germany (cf. Lang, Anthropology and the Classics, 51 et seq.; Tacitus, Germania, 11, 12, where their general duty of discussion and their criminal jurisdiction are mentioned). and the law-books. 14) Foy, Die königliche Gewalt, 6, 7, 10.

samidh|समिध्
सम्-इध्<BR> in the Rigveda 1) iv. 4, 15; vi. 15, 7; 16, 11; vii. 14, 1; x. 12, 2, etc. and later 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 4; xx. 25, etc. denotes the ‘fuel’ for kindling fire. Geldner 3) Rigveda, Glossar, 191. inclines to see in one passage 4) Rv. x. 52, 2. the name of a priest, the later Agnidh.

samudra|समुद्र
सम्-उद्र<BR> (literally ‘gathering of waters’), ‘ocean,’ is a frequent word in the Rigveda and later. It is of importance in so far as it indicates that the Vedic Indians knew the sea. This is, indeed, denied by Vivien de Saint Martin, 1) Étude sur la géographie du Véda, 62 et seq. Cf. Wilson, Rigveda, 1, xii. but not only do Max Müller 2) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 61 et seq., quoting Rv. i. 71, 7; 190, 7; v. 78, 8; vii. 49, 2; 95, 2; x. 58. and Lassen 3) Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 883. assert it, but even Zimmer, 4) Altindisches Leben, 22 et seq. Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 143, 144. who is inclined to restrict their knowledge of the sea as far as possible, admits it in one passage of the Rigveda, 5) vii. 95, 2. and of course later. 6) Av. iv. 10, 4 (pearl shell); vi. 105, 3 (the outflow, vi-kṣara, of the ocean); xix. 38, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 13, 1, etc. He points out that the ebb and flow of the sea are unknown, that the mouths of the Indus are never mentioned, that fish is not a known diet in the Rigveda (cf. Matsya), and that in many places Samudra is metaphorically used, as of the two oceans, 7) Rv. x. 136, 5. Cf. Av. xi. 5, 6. the lower and the upper oceans, 8) Rv. vii. 6, 7; x. 98, 5. etc. In other passages he thinks that Samudra denotes the river Indus when it receives all its Panjab tributaries. 9) See, e.g., Rv. i. 71, 7; iii. 36, 7; 46, 4; v. 85, 6; vi. 36, 3; vii. 95, 2; viii. 16, 2; 44, 25; ix. 88, 6; 107, 9; 108, 16 (where reference is made to streams); or Rv. i. 163, 1; iv. 21, 3; v. 55, 5; viii. 6, 29, where land and Samudra are contrasted. It is probable that this is to circumscribe too narrowly the Vedic knowledge of the ocean, which was almost inevitable to people who knew the Indus. There are references to the treasures of the ocean, 10) Cf. Rv. i. 47, 6; vii. 6, 7; ix. 97, 44. perhaps pearls or the gains of trade, 11) Cf. Rv. i. 48, 3; 56, 2; iv. 55, 6; and the general parallelism of the Dioscuri and the Aśvins. and the story of Bhujyu seems to allude to marine navigation. That there was any sea trade with Babylon in Vedic times cannot be proved: the stress Iaid 12) E.g., by Weber, Indian Literature, 3. on the occurrence in the Hebrew Book of Kings 13) 1. Kings x. 22. of qof and tukhiīm, ‘monkey’ (kapi) and ‘peacock,’ is invalidated by the doubtful date of the Book of Kings. There is, besides, little reason to assume an early date for the trade that no doubt developed later, perhaps about 700 B.C. 14) See Kennedy, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1898, 241-288; Bühler, Indische Studien, 3, 79 et seq.; Indisehe Palœographie, 17-19, who much exaggerates the antiquity of the traffic; Vincent Smith, Early History of India, 25, n. In the later texts Samudra repeatedly means the sea. 15) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 8, 2; vii. 5, 1, 2. It is described as unfailing in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 16, 7 (cf. iii. 39, 7); it encircles the earth, ibid., viii. 25, 1. The eastern and western oceans in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 11 (cf. x. 6, 4, 1), though metaphorical, probably indicate an acquaintance with both seas, the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 14-19; Pischel and Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, xxiii.

samraaj|सम्राज्
सम्राज्<BR> in the Rigveda 1) iii. 55, 7; 56, 5; iv. 21, 1; vi. 27, 8; viii. 19, 32. and later 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, v. 32; xiii. 35; xx. 5, etc. means ‘superior ruler, ‘sovereign,’ as expressing a greater degree of power than ‘king’ (Rājan). In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 3) v. 1, 1, 13. Cf. xii. 8, 3, 4; xiv. 1, 3, 8. in accordance with its curious theory of the Vājapeya and Rājasūya, the Samrāj is asserted to be a higher authority than a king, and to have become one by the sacrifice of the Vājapeya. There is, however, no trace of the use of the word as ‘emperor’ in the sense of an ‘overlord of kings,’ probably because political conditions furnished no example of such a status, as for instance was attained in the third century B.C. by Aśoka. At the same time Samrāj denotes an important king like Janaka of Videha. 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 3, 2, 1. 6; 2, 2, 3; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 1, 1; 3, 1. Cf. Weber, U7ber den Vājapeya, 8. It is applied in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 5) viii. 14, 2. 3. The other names are given as follows: For the northerners it is Virāj: for the southerners, Svarāj; for the Satvants, Bhoja: for the middle people (Kuru-Pañcāla, Vaśa, and Uśīnara), Rājan simply. This is probably a sound tradition. as the title of the eastern kings. Cf. Rājya.

saragh|सरघ्
सरघ्,<BR> 1) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 3, 14. Saraghā, 2) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxi. 4, 4; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 10, 1. both denote ‘bee’ in the Brāhmaṇas. See also Sarah.

sarayu|सरयु
सरयु<BR> is mentioned thrice in the Rigveda as the name of river. Citraratha and Arṇa are said to have been defeated apparently by the Turvaśas and Yadus who crossed the Sarayu. 1) iv. 30, 18. This passage gives no help, because the possibility is open either to suppose that the Turvaśa, Yadu are not mentioned as defeating the Āryans Citraratha and Arṇa; or, if they are, to suppose that they may have come east against the two. Sarayu appears in one passage with Sarasvatī and Sindhu, 2) x. 64, 9. and in another with Rasā, Anitabhā, and Kubha. 3) v. 53, 9. Later, in the post-Vedic period, Sarayū, rarely Sarayu, is the name of a river in Oudh, the modern Sarjū. 4) This is a tributary joining the Gogrā, the great river of Oudh, on the left of its upper course. The name Sarjū is also applied to the Gogrā itself below Bahrāmghāt. A branch of the Lower Gogrā, given off on the right, flowing in an old bed of the Gogrā, and falling into the Ganges after passing Balliā, is called the Chhotī (Lesser) Sarjū. Cf. Imperial Gazetteer of India, 22, 109; 12, 302 (Gogrā); 23, 418 (Eastern Tons); 26, Plate 31. Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 17, 45. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2^2, xxv; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 323. regards this as the river meant in all the Vedic passages, seeing in the last, 3) v. 53, 9. which may be used as an argument for locating the Sarayu in the Panjab, a reference to the north-east monsoon as well as to the usual monsoon from the west. Hopkins 6) Religions of India, 34. thinks that the Sarayu is to be found in the west, and Ludwig 7) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 280. identifies it with the Kurum (Krumu). Vivien de St. Martin considered it to be probably identical with the united course of the Śutudrī (Sutlej) and Vipāś (Beas).

saras|सरस्
सरस्<BR> denotes ‘lake’ in the later Saṃhitās 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 47, 48; xxx. 16. and the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 33, 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 9; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 5, 3.

sarasvatii|सरस्वती
सरस्वती<BR> 1) Literally, ‘abounding in pools,’ perhaps with reference to its condition when the water was low. The name corresponds phonetically to the Iranian Haraqaiti (the modern Helmand). is the name of a river frequently mentioned in the Rigveda and later. In many passages 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 2, 1, 4; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 10, 1; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xii. 2, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 1, 14; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 19, 1. 2; probably Av. vi. 30, 1. This list is according to Roth's view, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3c. of the later texts it is certain the river meant is the modern Sarasvatī, which loses itself in the sands of Patiala (see Vinaśana). Even Roth 3) Rv. iii. 23, 4 (where the Dṛṣadvatī appears); x. 64, 9: 75, 5 (where the Śindhu also is mentioned). admits that this river is intended in some passages of the Rigveda. With the Dṛṣadvatī 4) Probably the modern Chautang, which flows to the east of Thanesar. Cf. Oldham, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 25, 58; Imperial Gasetteer of India, 26, Plate 32. it formed the western boundary of Brahmāvarta (see Madhyadeśa). It is the holy stream of early Vedic India. The Sūtras 5) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 3, 20; xxiv. 6, 22; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 15, 1; 18, 13; 19, 4; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 6, 2. 3; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 29. mention sacrifices held on its banks as of great importance and sanctity. In many other passages of the Rigveda, 6) i. 89, 3; 164, 19; ii. 41, 16 et seq.; 30, 8; 32, 8; iii. 54, 13; v. 42, 12; 43, 11; 46, 2; vi. 49, 7; 50, 12; 52, 6; vii. 9, 5; 36, 6; 39, 5; 40, 3; viii. 21, 17; 54, 4; x. 17, 7; 30, 12; 131, 5; 184, 2. and even later, 7) Av. iv. 4. 6; v. 23, 1; vi. 3, 2; 89, 3; vii. 68, 1; xiv. 2, 15. 20; xvi. 4, 4; xix. 32, 9; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 1, 8, 13, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 93; xxxiv. 11; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 2, 4; xi. 4, 3, 3; xii. 7, 1, 12; 2, 5; Bṛnadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 3, 8. These passages should all be classed in n. 2. Roth held that another river, the Sindhu (Indus), was really meant: only thus could it be explained why the Sarasvatī is called the ‘foremost of rivers’ (nadītamā), 8) Rv. ii. 41, 16. is said to go to the ocean, 9) Rv. vi. 61, 2. 8; vii. 96, 2. and is referred to as a large river, on the banks of which many kings, 10) Rv. viii. 21, 18. and, indeed, the five tribes, were located. 11) Rv. vi. 61, 12. This view is accepted by Zimmer 12) Altindisches Leben, 5-10. and others. 13) E.g., Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 60; 2, 90, etc.; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 201, 202. On the other hand, Lassen 14) Indische Alterthumshunde, 1^2, 118. and Max Müller 15) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 60. maintain the identity of the Vedic Sarasvatī with the later Sarasvatī. 16) In the enumeration of rivers (evidently from east to west) in Rv. x. 75, 5, Gaṅgā, Yamunā, Sarasvatī, Śutudrī, the Sarasvatī comes between the Jumna and the Sutlej, the position of the modern Sarsūti (Saraswatī), which, flowing to the west of Thanesar, is joined in Patiala territory by a more westerly stream, the Ghaggar, and, passing Sirsa, is lost in the desert at Bhatnair; but a dry river bed (Hakra or Ghaggar) can be traced from that point to the Indus. See Imperial Gasetteer of India, 26, Plate 32. Cf. also Oldham, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 25, 49-76. The latter is of opinion that in Vedic times the Sarasvatī was as large a stream as the Sutlej, and that it actually reached the sea either after union with the Indus or not, being the ‘iron citadel,’ as the last boundary on the west, a frontier of the Panjab against the rest of India. There is no conclusive evidence of there having been any great change in the size or course of the Sarasvatī, though it would be impossible to deny that the river may easily have diminished in size. But there are strong reasons to accept the identification of the later and the earlier Sarasvatī throughout. The insistence on the divine character of the river is been in the very hymn 17) Rv. ii. 41, 16 (devitame). which refers to it as the support of the five tribes, and corresponds well with its later sacredness. Moreover, that hymn alludes to the Pārāvatas, a people shown by the later evidence of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 18) See Pārāvata, and cf. Bṛsaya. to have been in the east, a very long way from their original home, if Sarasvatī means the Indus. Again, the Pūrus, who were settled on the Sarasvatī, 19) Rv. vii. 95, 96. Ludwig, op. cit., 3, 175, admits that the Indus cannot be meant here. See Hillebrandt. Vedische Mythologie, 1, 115. could with great difficulty be located in the far west. Moreover, the five tribes might easily be held to be on the Sarasvatī, when they were, as they seem to have been, the western neighbours of the Bharatas in Kurukṣetra, and the Sarasvatī could easily be regarded as the boundary of the Panjab in that sense. Again, the ‘seven rivers’ in one passage 20) Rv. viii. 24, 27. The connexion of Sarasvatī and the seven rivers is rather vague. In Rv. viii. 54, 4, Sarasvatī and the seven rivers are separately invoked, and in vi. 61, 10, 12, she is referred to as ‘seven-sistered’ (saptasvasā). In vii. 36, 6, she is called the ‘seventh,’ which makes the Sarasvatī one of the rivers. If the former passages are to be treated as precise, then saptasvasā may be considered to show that the Sarasvatī was outside the river system (which would then be Indus, Kubhā, and the five rivers of the Panjab; see Sapta Sindhavaḥ); but the expression may be loosely meant for one of seven sisters. clearly designate a district: it is most probable that they are not the five rivers with the Indus and the Kubhā (Cabul river), but the five rivers, the Indus and the Sarasvatī. Nor is it difficult to see why the river is said to flow to the sea: either the Vedic poet had never followed the course of the river to its end, or the river did actually penetrate the desert either completely or for a long distance, and only in the Brāhmaṇa period was its disappear ance in the desert found out. It is said, indeed, in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 21) xxxiv. 11. that the five rivers go to the Sarasvatī, but this passage is not only late (as the use of the word Deśa shows), but it does not say that the five rivers meant are those of the Panjab. Moreover, the passage has neither a parallel in the other Saṃhitās, nor can it possibly be regarded as an early production; if it is late it must refer to the later Sarasvatī. Hillebrandt, 22) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 99 et seq.; 3, 372-378. on the whole, adopts this view of the Sarasvatī, 23) He sees this sense in the Rigveda everywhere, except in the passages indicated in notes 24 and 25. but he also sees in it, besides the designation of a mythical stream, the later Vaitaraṇī, 24) vii. 95, 6; x. 17, 7; Av. vii. 68, 2; xiv. 2, 20; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxxv. 10, 11. as well as the name of the Arghandab in Arachosia. 25) Rv. vi. 49, 7; 61; possibly Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 11. This opinion depends essentially on his theory that the sixth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda places the scene of its action in Iranian lands, as opposed to the seventh Maṇḍala: it is as untenable as that theory itself. 26) See Divodāsa. Brunnhofer 27) Bezzenberger's Beiträge, 10, 261, n. 2. at one time accepted the Iranian identification, but later 28) Iran und Turan, 127. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 337 et seq., Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 141, 142; Vedic Mythology, pp. 86-88; von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 84, 164. decided for the Oxus, which is quite out of the question. See also Plakṣa Prāsravaṇa.

sarah|सरह्
सरह्<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 112, 21. and later 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 3, 12, 12; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 1, 4. The stem is given as Saraṭ in the Uṇādisūtra, 1, 133; but Saragh shows that Sarah must be meant (cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 238, n. 2). Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 97. denotes ‘bee.’ Cf. Saragha.

sarit|सरित्
सरित्<BR> denotes ‘stream’ in the Rigveda 1) iv. 58, 6; vii. 70, 2; Av. xii. 2, 41; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 11; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 1, 11, etc. and later.^2 

sariisRpa|सरीसृप
सरीसृप<BR> denotes in the Rigveda, 1) x. 162, 3. and often later, 2) Av. iii. 10, 6: xix. 7, 1; 48, 3, etc. any ‘creeping animal’ or ‘reptile.’

sarpa|सर्प
सर्प,<BR> ‘serpent,’ occurs once in the Rigveda, 1) x. 16, 6. where Ahi is the usual word, but often later. 2) Av. x. 4, 23; xi. 3, 47; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 5, 4, 1; iii. 1, 1, 1, etc.

sarparaaJNii|सर्पराज्ञी
सर्प-राज्ञी,<BR> ‘serpent-queen,’ is the alleged authoress of a hymn of the Rigveda 1) x. 189. according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 2) i. 5, 4, 1; vii. 3, 1, 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 6, 6; ii. 2, 6, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 23, 1, 2.

sarpavidyaa|सर्पविद्या
सर्प-विद्या,<BR> the ‘science of snakes,’ is enumerated in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa among branches of learning. It must have been reduced to fixed rules, since a section (parvan) of it is referred to as studied. The Gopatha Brāhmaṇa 2) i. 1, 10. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 367, n. 3. has the form Sarpa-veda. ^1 xiii. 4, 3, 9. Cf. Śānkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 2, 25. The Āśvalāyana Srauta Sūtra, x. 7, 5, has Viṣa-vidyā, and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (vii. 1. 2. 4; 2, 1; 4, 1; 7, 1) has sarpadevajana-vidyā.

sarpivaatsi|सर्पिवात्सि
सर्पि वात्सि<BR> (‘descendant of Vatsa’) is the name of a teacher in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 1) vi. 24, 15. Aufrecht, Altareya Brāhmaṇa, 424, takes the name to be Sarpir. The point is, of course, doubtful, since the word occurs in the nominative only.

sarpis|सर्पिस्
सर्पिस्<BR> denotes ‘melted butter,’ whether in a liquid or solidified condition, and not differing from Ghṛta according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary. Roth there rejects the definition cited by Sāyaṇa in his commentary on the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 1) i. 3, 5. which discriminates Sarpis as the liquid and Ghṛta as the solid condition of the butter. The word is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda 2) i. 127, 1; v. 6, 9; x. 18, 7. and later. 3) Av. i. 15, 4; ix. 6, 41; x. 9, 12; xii. 3, 45; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 10, 1, etc. 

sarvacharu|सर्वचरु
सर्व-चरु<BR> is found in a passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) vi. 1, 1. and of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, 2) xxix. 1. where the gods are referred to as holding a sacrifice sarvacarau. The word is the name of a man according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary; the name of a place 3) Sāyaṇa on Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. seems possible, or even a mere adjective may be meant. 4) Aufrecht, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 425, n. 1, who suggests that yajñe is to be supplied.

sarvavedasa|सर्ववेदस
सर्व-वेदस<BR> denotes in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas either a sacrifice in which the sacrificer gives his all to the priests, 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 7, 7; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 14; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ix. 3, 1. or the whole property of a man. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 1, 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 8, 1; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vi. 7, 15; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 6, 1, 15, etc.

sarShapa|सर्षप
सर्षप,<BR> denoting ‘mustard’ or ‘mustard seed,’ occurs only a few times in later Vedic texts. 1) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iii. 14, 3. Cf. Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 2; Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, iv. 15, 8, etc. It is common in the later language.

salaavRkii|सलावृकी
सला-वृकी<BR> See Sālāvṛka.

salilavaata|सलिलवात
सलिल-वात<BR> occurs in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 12, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiv. 4; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 16, 4. as an adjective meaning ‘favoured with a wind from the water.’ 2) Or, according to the commentator, salilākhyena vāta-viśeṣeṇa anugṛhītaḥ, ‘favoured by a kind of wind called Salila.’ It probably refers to the wind from the ocean, the south-west monsoon. 3) Indian Empire, 1, 110. The monsoon is little noted in the Vedic texts, except in so far as the Marut hymns may be deemed to be a description of the monsoon. See Rv. i. 19, 7; 37, 6 et seq.; 38, 8; 64, 8; 88, 5; v. 83, 1 et seq.; 85, 4; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 42-44. 

salva|सल्व
सल्व<BR> is the name of a people mentioned in a passage of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) x. 4, 1, 10. which records a boast by Śyāparṇa Sāyakāyana that if a certain rite of his had been completed, his race would have been the nobles, Brahmins, and peasants of the Salvas, and even as it was his race would surpass the Salvas. This people appears also to be alluded to as Sālvīḥ (prajāḥ) in the Mantra Pāṭha, 2) ii. 11, 12. where they are said to have declared that their king was Yaugandhari when they stayed their chariots 3) Winternitz, Mantra-pāṭha, xlv-xlvii, sees in the verse an allusion to the Sālva women turning round the wheel (? spinning-wheel). But a reference to a warlike raid seems more plauaible. on the banks of the Yamunā. There is later evidence 4) Mahābhārata, iv. 1, 12; viii. 44 (45), 14. The Yugandharas are also referred to in a Kārikā quoted in the Kāśikā Vṛtti on Pāṇini, iv. 1, 173. indicating that the Sālvas or Śālvas were closely connected with the Kuru-Pañcālas, and that apparently some of them, at least, were victorious near the banks of the Yamunā. There is no good evidence to place them in the north-west in Vedic times. 5) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 215. Later, they may have been found in Rājasthān, Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 760.

savyaShThaa|सव्यष्ठा
सव्य-ष्ठा,<BR> 1) Av. viii. 8, 23. Savya-ṣṭhṛ, 2) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 4, 9; 3, 1, 8; 4, 3, 17, 18. Savye-ṣṭha, 3) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. i. 7, 9, 1. and Savya-stha 4) Kāṇva recension of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 62, n. 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 8. are all various forms of the word for ‘car-fighter,’ as opposed to Sārathi, ‘charioteer,’ showing that, as was natural, the fighter stood on the left of the driver. The commentators 5) On Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 1, 8; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. are inclined to see in the Savyaṣṭhā merely another ‘charioteer,’ but this is quite unjustifiable, 6) Eggeling, loc. cit.; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 235. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 296. and is perhaps due to later caste prejudice against a Śūdra charioteer.

sasa|सस
सस<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 51, 3; x. 79, 3. denotes ‘herb’ or ‘grass.’ 1) i. 51, 3; x. 79, 3. The word is also applied to the Soma plant 2) iii. 5, 6; iv. 5, 7, etc. and the sacrificial straw. 3) v. 21, 4. 

sasarparii|ससर्परी
ससर्परी<BR> is a word occurring in two curious verses of the Rigveda. 1) iii. 53, 15, 16. According to a later interpretation, 2) Bṛhaddevatā, iii. 113, with Macdonell's notes. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 159. it designates a particular kind of skill in speech which Viśvāmitra obtained from Jamadagni. What it was is quite uncertain.

sasya|सस्य
सस्य<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) vii. 11, 1; viii. 10, 24. and later 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 3, 3; v. 1, 7, 3; vii. 5, 20, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 2, etc. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 284. regularly denotes ‘corn’ generally. It corresponds to the Avestan hahya. See Kṛṣi.

saha|सह
सह<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) xi. 6, 15. Cf. Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 10. is, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2b. the name of a plant, but Bloomfield 3) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 648. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 642; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72. thinks the word is only an adjective meaning ‘mighty.’

sahadeva|सहदेव
सह-देव<BR> is the name of a prince in the Rigveda, 1) i. 100, 17. where he is victorious over the Śimyus and Dasyus. It is quite probable that he is identical with King Sahadeva Sārñjaya, who is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2) ii. 4, 4, 3. 4. Cf. xii. 8, 2, 3. as having once been called Suplan Sārñjaya, and as having changed his name because of his success in performing the Dākṣāyaṇa sacrifice. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 3) vii. 34, 9. he is mentioned with Somaka Sahadevya, who also appears in the Rigveda. 4) iv. 15, 7 et seq. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 132; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105, 106.

sahadevii|सहदेवी
सह-देवी<BR> is the name of a plant in the Atharvaveda 1) vi. 59, 2. Cf. Grill, Hundert Lieder,^2 163; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 325; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 490, who does not accept this reading. A plant called Sahadeva occurs in the Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 10. according to the reading of the commentary.

sahojit|सहोजित्
सहो-जित्<BR> See Jaitrāyaṇa.

saaMvaraNi|सांवरणि
सांवरणि<BR> is found in the Rigveda 1) viii. 51, 1. in one passage, where it naturally seems to be a patronymic (‘descendant of Saṃvaraṇa’) of Manu. According to Bloomfield, 2) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 180, n. it is a corruption for Sāvarṇi, a reference to Manu's birth from the savarṇā, ‘similar’ female who was substituted for Saraṇyū according to the legend (see Manu). This is possible, but not certain. Scheftelowitz 3) Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 38. thinks that the reading of the Kaśmir manuscript of the Rigveda, which has sāṃvaraṇam, ‘found on the sacrificial ground,’ as an epithet of Soma, is to be preferred. But this seems quite improbable. 4) See Oldenberg, Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1907, 237. We must either recognize a real man called Manu Sāṃvaraṇi; or take Manu as one name, Sāṃvaraṇi as another; or admit that Manu Sāṃvaraṇi is simply Manu with a patronymic derived from an unknown legend.

Leumann, 2) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 80, n. 5. This conjecture seems improbable. however, thinks an epithet of Indra, Śācīgu, may be meant.

saaMjiiviiputra|सांजीवीपुत्र
सांजीवी-पुत्र,<BR> ‘son of Sāṃjīvī,’ is the name of a teacher who appears in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) at the end of the tenth Kāṇḍa of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 1) x. 6, 5, 9. and at the end of the fourteenth Kāṇḍa in the Kāṇva recension, 2) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 5. 4 Kāṇva. as a pupil of Māṇḍūkāyani. In the Vaṃśas at the end of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad in both recensions 3) Ibid., vi. 4, 32 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 5, 2 Kāṇva). Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, xxxiv et seq.; Wéber, Indian Literature, 131. he is given as a pupil of Prāśnīputra Āsurivāsin. It seems clear that he united in himself two lines of teachers--that of the tradition of the firecult from Śāṇḍilya, and that of the tradition of Yājñavalkya.

Āśvalāyana 6) Sūtra, ix. 9, 14. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 230, 295, 296; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 358; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 177; Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1898, 564. knows sādya as a ‘riding horse’ opposed to vahya, a ‘draught animal.’

saadhaaraNii|साधारणी
साधारणी<BR> in one passage of the Rigveda 1) i. 167, 4. seems to refer not so much to an uxor communis, like Draupadī in the Epic, as Max Müller 2) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 277. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 332; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 461; Pischel and Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, xxv. suggests, but to a courtezan.

साप्त<BR> in the Rigveda 1) viii. 55, 5. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 552; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 266. may be a proper name, but the sense is quite uncertain.

सा-वर्णि<BR> is found as a patronymic in the Rigveda 1) x. 62, 11. together with Sāvarṇya. 2) x. 62, 9. It is clear that no man called Savarṇa ever existed, though Roth 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 17. accepted that view, and that the reference is to the mythical Manu Sāvarṇi, the descendant of the sa-varṇā female, who, according to the legend, 4) Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society 15, 179 et seq. took the place of Saraṇyū.

When Agni, who has entered the waters, is compared to a lion, 7) Rv. iii. 9, 4. the reference may be to the lion's habit of springing on animals at drinking places. That a jackal should defeat the lion is spoken of as a marvel. 8) Rv. x. 28, 4.

सीता,<BR> ‘furrow,’ occurs in the Rigveda, 1) iv. 57, 6. 7 (the most agricultural of Rigvedic hymns, and probably late). and often later. 2) Av. xi. 3, 12; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 5, 4. 5; 6, 2, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xx. 3, etc. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 86, n.

siiman|सीमन्
सीमन्<BR> denotes the ‘parting’ of the hair in the Atharvaveda 1) ix. 8, 13. and later. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 7, 4; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 1; xv. 5, 20; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 4, 1, 14. Cf. sīmanta in Av. vi. 134, 3; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 17, 3.

siira|सीर
सीर,<BR> ‘plough,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) iv. 57, 8; x. 101, 3, 4. and often later. 2) Av. vi. 30, 1; 91, 1; viii. 9, 16, etc.; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 1, 2; ii. 5, 8, 12; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 11, 4. It was large and heavy, as is shown by the fact that six oxen, 3) Av. vi. 91, 1; viii. 9, 16; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 5, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 2; xx. 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 2, 2, 6; xiii. 8, 2, 6. or eight, 4) Av. vi. 91, 1. or twelve, 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 7, 1; v. 2, 5, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 2, etc. or even twenty-four, 6) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 244. n. 1. were used to drag it. The animals which drew the plough were oxen, which were, no doubt, yoked and harnessed with traces. 7) Varatrā is found in Rv. iv. 57, 4, and (of the ox in the Mudgala story) in x. 102, 8. It may denote the fastening of the ox to the yoke rather than to the plough by traces. The ox was guided by the Aṣṭrā, or ‘goad,’ of the ploughman (cf. Vaiśya). 8) Cf. Rv. iv. 57, 4; x. 102, 8. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236, 237. Little is known of the parts of the plough. See Lāṅgala and Phāla.

siila|सील
सील,<BR> ‘plough,’ is found in the Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā (xxviii. 8). 

siilamaavatii|सीलमावती
सीलमावती<BR> in the Rigveda 1) x. 75, 8. is, according to Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200. the name of a river; but this is most improbable. 3) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 429; Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v.; Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 195. Sāyaṇa thinks the word means ‘rich in hemp.’

siisa|सीस
सीस,<BR> ‘lead,’ occurs first in the Atharvaveda, 1) xii. 2, 1. 19 et seq., 53. where it is mentioned as used for amulets. 2) i. 16, 2, 4. The word is then quite common. 3) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 13; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 12, 6, 5; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 2, 14; 4, 1, 9; xii. 7, 1, 7; 2, 10; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 17, 7, etc. The use of lead by the weaver as a weight is perhaps also referred to. 4) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 80; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 9; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 4. This is the view of Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and of Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 53. But Griffith, Translation of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 183, n., thinks that in xix. 80 lead is referred to not as a weight, but as a charm against demons and sorcery. Cf. Bloomfield, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 157, 158.

sukanyaa|सुकन्या

sujaata|सुजात
सु-जात,<BR> ‘well-born,’ is an epithet found applied to men in a few passages of the Rigveda. It would probably be a mistake to press the sense so as to denote ‘nobles’ as compared with the people. See Sabhā. ^1 ii. 2, 11; v. 6, 2; vii. 1, 4. 15; viii. 20, 8.

sutaMbhara|sutambhara|सुतंभर|सुतम्भर
सुतं-भर<BR> is credited by the Anukramaṇī (Index) with the authorship of certain hymns of the Rigveda. 1) v. 11-14. The word does not occur in those hymns, but it appears as an adjective (‘carrying away Soma’) elsewhere, 2) v. 44, 13. and may, in a second passage, 3) ix. 6, 6. by a conjecture 4) If sutaṃ-bharāya be read for sutdṃ bhárāya, as Roth suggests in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. be taken as a man's name.

sutvankairishibhaargaayaNa|सुत्वन्कैरिशिभार्गायण

sudaas|सुदास्
सु-दास्<BR> is the name of the Tṛtsu king who won a famous victory over the ten kings, as described in a hymn of the Rigveda. 1) vii. 18. See also Rv. vii. 20, 2; 25, 3; 32, 10; 33, 3; 64, 3; 83, 1 et seq. At one time Viśvāmitra was his Purohita, and accompanied him in his victorious raids over the Vipāś (Beās) and Śutudrī (Sutlej). 2) Rv. iii. 53, 9, 11. See also Viśvāmitra and Vaṣiṣṭha. The Aśvins gave him a queen, Sudevī, 3) Rv. i. 112, 19. and also helped him on another occasion. 4) Rv. i. 47, 9, where, however, Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1, takes su-dās as an adjective (‘worshipping well’). He appears with Trasadasyu in a late hymn without hint of rivalry, 5) Rv. vii. 19, 3. but elsewhere he seems to be referred to as defeated by Purukutsa, Trasadasyu's father. 6) Rv. i. 63, 7, reading Sudāsam for Sudāse with Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 174. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 112, n. 1; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 153; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 63. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 7) vii. 34, 9. he is recognized as a great king, with Vasiṣṭha as his Puro hita, and similarly in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 8) xvi. 11, 14. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 107 et seq.; Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 31 et seq. where his generosity to his priest is related. His exact ancestry is a little uncertain, because he is called Paijavana, ‘son of Pijavana,’ as Yāska explains the patronymic. If this explanation is correct, Divodāsa must have been his grandfather. If he was the son of Divodāsa, Pijavana must be understood as a more remote ancestor. The former alternative seems the more probable. Cf. Turvaśa, Dāśarājña. Paijavana, Bharata, Saudāsa.

sudeva|सुदेव
1. Su-deva is, according to Ludwig, 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160. the proper name of a sacrificer in one hymn of the Rigveda. 2) viii. 5, 6. 

sudevakaashyapa|सुदेवकाश्यप
2. Su-deva Kāśyapa (‘descendant of Kaśyapa’) is the name of a teacher in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 1) ii. 18. Cf. x. 1, 8; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 188, n.; 10, 103. who set forth the expiation for lack of chastity.

The Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa 4) ii. 438 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 19, 101). mentions an eagle which separates milk from water like the Kruñc. In the Rigveda 5) x. 144, 4. the Suparṇa is said to be the child of the Śyena, and is distinguished from the latter in another passage: 6) ii. 42, 2. this led Zimmer 7) Altindisches Leben, 88. to think that the falcon is probably meant. 8) In the post-Vedic period Suparṇa became a mythical bird, identified with Viṣnu's vehicle, Garuḍa, who, however, is also regarded as king of the Suparṇas. The Atharvaveda alludes to its cry, 9) ii. 30, 3. and describes it as living in the hills. 10) v. 4, 2. 

suparNa|सुपर्ण
2. Suparṇa is personified in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 3, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxix. 7. as a Ṛṣi.

supitrya|सुपित्र्य
सु-पित्र्य,<BR> a word occurring once in the Rigveda, 1) x. 115, 6. is probably an adjective (‘maintaining his paternal character well’). Ludwig, 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 169. however, regards it, but without any great probability, as a proper name.

Cf. Lévi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 139; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105, 106.

subandhu|सुबन्धु
सु-बन्धु<BR> in the hymns of the Rigveda 1) x. 59, 8; 60, 7, 10. is taken by Sāyaṇa to be a proper name; but this is not certain, Roth 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1. seeing in the passages only an ordinary noun meaning ‘a good friend.’ The later tradition 3) Bṛhaddevatā, vii. 83 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. See also Asamāti, n. 1. explains that Subandhu and his brothers, called Gaupāyanas, were priests of Asamāti, who cast them off and took two others, Kirāta and Ākuli. By these two in pigeon form Subandhu was caused to swoon, but was revived by his three brothers, who recited certain hymns. 4) Rv. x. 57-60. Cf.

Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 362, 374. denotes a priest who officiates as one of the three assistants of the Udgātṛ (see Ṛtvij). His office is Subrahmaṇyā. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 3, 1-7. 11, 12; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxvii. 6, etc. The priest himself is so styled, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 1, 2; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xviii. 9, 19, etc.

subhadrikaa|सुभद्रिका
सु-भद्रिका<BR> occurs in the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) section of the Yajurveda 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 18 (cf. Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2, 8, 3); Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 12, 20. as in some way connected with the rite. Weber 2) Indische Studien, 1, 183, 184; Indian Literature, 114, 115. Cf. Griffith, Translation of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 212, n. thinks that a proper name, that of the wife of the king of Kāmpīla, is intended, but Mahīdhara 3) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit. explains the word merely as a lady with many lovers or a courtezan, a view followed by Roth. 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. subhadraka, 2b; Böhtlingk's Dictionary, s.v. 2a. Since the Taittirīya 5) vii. 4, 19, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 9, 6. and Kāṭhaka 6) Aśvamedha, iv. 8. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 36, 37; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 321, 322. Saṃhitās have no Subhadrikā, but a vocative subhage (see Subhagā), the sense remains very doubtful.

3. Su-śravas Kauṣya is the name of a teacher, a contemporary of Kuśri Vājaśravasa, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (x. 5, 5, 1 et seq.).

sushravasvaarShagaNya|सुश्रवस्वार्षगण्य
4. Su-śravas Vārṣa-gaṇya (‘descendant of Vṛṣagaṇa’) is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Prātarahna Kauhala, in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372.

suShaaman|सुषामन्
सु-षामन्<BR> is the name of a man in one verse of the Rigveda, 1) viii. 25, 22; possibly 60, 18. and probably forms part of the strange name, Varo Suṣāman, in other passages. 2) viii. 23, 28; 24, 28; 26, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 162. Cf. Varu.

suShomaa|सुषोमा
सु-षोमा<BR> occurs certainly as the name of a river in the Nadīstuti (‘praise of rivers’) in the Rigveda. 1) x. 75, 5; Nirukta, ix. 26, where it is absurdly identified with the Sindu (Indus). In two other passages it would seem to be a proper name, once masculine, 2) viii. 7, 29. perhaps the people, and once feminine, 3) viii. 64, 11. though Roth 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2. sees in the word the designation of a Soma vessel. Its identification is quite uncertain, though it has been thought to be the  of Megasthenes, 5) See Arrian, Indica, iv. 12; Schwanbeck, Megasthenes, 31, where there is a various reading . Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 126 et seq.; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 398, 399; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 12-14. the modern Suwan.

susartu|सुसर्तु
सु-सर्तु<BR> is the name of a river in the Nadī-stuti (‘praise of rivers’) in the Rigveda. 1) x. 75, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200. That it was a tributary of the Indus is certain, but which one is unknown.

suhavisaangirasa|सुहविसाङ्गिरस
सु-हविस् आङ्गिरस<BR> (‘descendant of Aṅgiras’) is the name of the seer of a Sāman or chant in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 3, 25).

suukara|सूकर
सू-कर<BR> ‘wild-boar,’ has the appearance of being an onomatopoetic word (‘making the sound sū’); it is more probably a very old word going back to the Indo-European period, and cognate with the Latin su-culus (‘little pig’), being transformed in sense by popular etymology. 1) The sū- corresponding to Lat. sū-s, Gk. -s, Old High German, sū. Cf. Brugmann, Grundriss, 2^2, 483. It occurs in the Rigveda 2) vii. 55, 4. and later. 3) Av. ii. 27, 2; v. 14, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 21; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 40; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 10, 2, etc. None of the passages refer to the flesh as eaten: Buddha's death was due to a meal of sūkaramaddava, which may well mean ‘tender parts of pork’ (see Fleet, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1906, 881, n.), though the Rājanighaṇṭu, vii. 85, gives sūkara as meaning the Batatas edulis. It appears once in the Atharvaveda accompanied by mṛga, 4) xii. 1, 48. The use of mṛga here does not indicate that sūkara is a new name, because the latter word elsewhere always occurs alone both in the Rigveda and later (n. 3). Cf. Mṛga above, 2, 172, n. 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 82; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 100. the combined words apparently meaning ‘wild hog,’ as opposed to Varāha, ‘boar.’ 

suukta|सूक्त
सूक्त,<BR> ‘well uttered,’ is the regular term for a ‘hymn’ as part of the Śastra in the later Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 4, 5, 5; vii. 1, 5, 4, etc. and the Brāhmaṇas. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 33; iii. 11, 9. 12-15; iv. 21, 5; vi. 8, 10; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1; xv. 3; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 1, 18; Nirukta, iv. 6; xi. 16. The sense of ‘hymn’ must also be recognized in several passages of the Rigveda. 3) i. 42, 20; 171, 1; ii. 6, 2; vii. 29, 3, etc.

suuchii|सूची
सूची,<BR> ‘needle,’ is found in the Rigveda 1) ii. 32, 4. and later. 2) Av. xi. 10, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 33; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 9, 6, 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 18, 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2, 10, 2. 3; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 10; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 10, 3 (Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 228).

suuchiika|सूचीक
सूचीक<BR> is the name of a stinging insect in the Rigveda. 1) i. 191, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

suuta|सूत
सूत<BR> is the name of a court official who is often mentioned with the Grāmaṇī. He is one of the eight Vīras in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 1) ix. 1, 4, where he follows the chief queen (Mahiṣī), and precedes the Grāmaṇī in the list. and of the eleven Ratnins in other texts. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 4; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 5; iv. 3, 8; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 3, 1; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 9, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 1, 5. He also appears in the Atharvaveda 3) iii. 5, 7. among the kingmakers (Rājakṛt) and in the Śatrarudriya 4) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5, 2, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 18. So also in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’), Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 6; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 2, 1. For other references to the Sūta, see Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 18, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 4, 7; xiii. 4, 2, 5; 7, 1, 43; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxviii. 3; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 3, 37, 38. (‘section dealing with the hundred Rudras’) of the Yajurveda. The commentators are agreed in seeing in him the ‘charioteer’ (Sārathi) or ‘master of the horse,’ of the king; this sense is accepted by Roth, 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. by Whitney, 6) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 62. and by Bloomfield. 7) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 114. But the fact that the Saṃ grahītṛ, who occurs in several passages beside the Sūta, is the ‘charioteer,’ renders this version improbable. Eggeling 8) Sacred Books of the East, 41, 62, n. 1. thinks that he was, in the Brāhmaṇas at least, a minstrel and court poet, while Weber 9) Indische Studien, 17, 200. considers that his name denotes him as ‘consecrated’--that is, one who has constant access to the king. In the Epic the Sūta serves as a royal herald and bard: 10) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 254, 255. it may be that the curious words ahanti, 11) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 18. This word means ‘non-fighter’ according to Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 200. ahantya, 12) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 2, 1. or ahantva 13) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 3. applied to him 14) The last two forms appear to be equivalent in sense to ahanya, ‘not to be slain,’ ‘inviolable.’ in the Śatarudriya denote his sacred character at once as minstrel and as herald--a combination of functions not unknown elsewhere.

suutavashaa|सूतवशा
सूत-वशा<BR> denotes in the Yajurveda 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 5, 4; vi. 1, 3, 6; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 5; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 4, 1, etc. a cow barren after having one calf.

suutra|सूत्र
सूत्र<BR> has the sense of ‘thread’ in the Atharvaveda 1) iii. 9, 3; xviii. 8, 37. and later. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 4, 14; vii. 3, 2, 13; xii. 3, 4, 2; 7, 2, 10; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 8, 2; Nirukta, iv. 6. In the sense of a ‘book of rules’ for the guidance of sacrificers and so forth, the word occurs in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 3) ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 6 (Mādhyaṃdina = iv. 1, 2 Kāṇva); 5, 11. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 24, 25; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 21.

suuda|सूद
सूद,<BR> according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, means ‘well’ 1) Rv. vii. 36, 3; ix. 97, 4. and the ‘mud of a dried-up pool.’ 2) Rv. x. 61, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvi. 13; Taittirīya brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 3, 5; 2, 1, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, viii. 7, 3, 21. Pischel, 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 72, 73. however, shows clearly that Sūda denotes what is added to Soma to make it fit for use, especially the warm milk, and this sense suits all the passages. Eggeling 4) Sacred Books of the East, 43, 144. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 211. renders it ‘well,’ and Grassmann ‘sweet drink.’

suudadohas|सूददोहस्
सूद-दोहस्<BR> in the Rigveda 1) viii. 69, 3. denotes ‘milking Sūda’--i.e., what is requisite to mix with Soma, according to Pischel. 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 72. Sūdayitnu in Rv. x. 64, 9, may be taken in the same way, and sūdin in Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvii. 2; sūdya in Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 13, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 25, etc. According to Roth, 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. it means ‘yielding milk like a well.’

suunaa|सूना
सूना<BR> means, in the Rigveda 1) i. 161, 10; 162, 13; x. 86, 18. and the Atharvaveda, 2) Av. v. 17, 14. Crates of Palāśa wood are mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvii. 3, 2. 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 271. apparently a ‘woven (from sīv, ‘sew’) wickerwork basket’ for holding flesh.

suunu|सूनु
सूनु<BR> is a common word for ‘son’ from the Rigveda onwards. 1) Rv. i. 26, 3; ii. 38, 5; vi. 52, 9, etc.; Av. vi. 1, 2; vii. 2, 2; xii. 3, 23, etc. The etymological sense seems to be ‘he who is borne,’ and then ‘the begotten.’ 2) Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandischaftsnamen, 453. But the use of Sūnu in the Rigveda 3) Usually in a figurative sense--e.g sahasaḥ, adreḥ Sūruḥ. is predominantly in relation to the father, and only rarely in its connexion with words for mother. 4) v. 42, 2. Thus a father is ‘easy of access’ (sāpāyana) to his son (sūnu); 5) Rv. i. 1, 9. but in another passage, 6) Rv. x. 18, 11. where the same term is applied to earth as a mother, the word used for son is Putra. No conclusion as to matriarchy can of course be drawn from the etymology. On the relation of son and father, see Pitṛ. 

suuri|सूरि
सूरि<BR> is the regular word in the Rigveda 1) i. 31, 7. 12; 48, 24; 54, 11; 73, 5. 8, 9; iii. 31, 14; v. 42, 4; 79, 6; vi. 4, 8; 23, 10; vii. 32, 15; viii. 70, 15; x. 61, 22; 115, 5. 7. 8. for the sacrificer, the later Yajamāna--that is, the man who pays the priests for performing the rite, and reaps the benefit of that service. The Sūris are often coupled with the Maghavans, 1) i. 31, 7. 12; 48, 24; 54, 11; 73, 5. 8, 9; iii. 31, 14; v. 42, 4; 79, 6; vi. 4, 8; 23, 10; vii. 32, 15; viii. 70, 15; x. 61, 22; 115, 5. 7. 8. described as heroes or warriors, 2) i. 69, 3; 73, 9; 119, 3; 122, 12; 180, 9; vii. 32, 15. and as related to the priests by their patronage 3) i. 97, 3, 4; v. 10, 6; vi. 8, 7; 25, 7; vii. 3, 8; 44, 18; viii. 60, 6; x. 66, 2. or as companions. 4) v. 64, 5; vii. 32, 25; viii. 45, 36; ix. 96, 4; x. 115, 7. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 236.

suurmi|सूर्मि
सूर्मि<BR> denotes in the Rigveda 1) vii. 1, 3. and later, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 5, 7, 6; v. 4, 7, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxi. 9, where it is described as karṇakāvatī, rendered by Roth as ‘provided with a handle.’ according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, a kind of ‘tube’ serving as a lamp. In one passage of the Rigveda 3) viii. 69, 12. Sūrmya in Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 9, 2, may mean ‘being in pipes or channels.’ it means a ‘pipe’ for conveying water. Cf. Avata.

suurya|सूर्य
सूर्य,<BR> the ‘sun,’ plays a great part in Vedic mythology and religion, 1) See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 30 et seq. corresponding with the importance of the sun as a factor in the physical life of the peninsula. In the Rigveda 2) E.g., i. 50, 6; 115, 1. 3; 164, 11. 13; 191, 8. 9; vii. 63, 1; x. 37, 4; 85, 9; 88, 11; 139, 3, etc. the sun is normally regarded as a beneficent power, a not unnatural view in a people which must apparently have issued from the cold regions of the Himālaya mountains. Its heat is, however, alluded to in some passages of the Rigveda, 3) Rv. vii. 34, 19; ix. 107, 20. as well as referred to in the Atharvaveda and the literature of the Brāhmaṇas. 4) Ehni, Yama, 134; Macdonell, op. cit., p. 31. In one myth Indra is said to have vanquished Sūrya and to have stolen his wheel: 5) i. 175, 4; iv. 30, 4; x. 43, 5. this is possibly a reference to the obscuration of the sun by a thunderstorm. 6) Macdonell, loc. cit. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 7) iii. 44, 4. presents a naive conception of the course of the sun, which it regards as bright on one side only, and as returning from west to east by the same road, but with the reverse side turned towards the earth, thus at night illumining the stars in heaven. 8) Macdonell, p. 10, who compares Rv. i. 115. 5; x. 37, 3. See also Speyer, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1906, 723; Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 6. In the Rigveda 9) Rv. iv. 13, 5. wonder is expressed that the sun does not fall. There are several references to eclipses in the Rigveda. In one passage 10) Rv. v. 40, 5-9. Cf. Macdonell, p. 160; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5, 2; 6, 14; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxiv. 3; Tilak, Orion, 159. Svarbhānu, a demon, is said to have eclipsed the sun with darkness, while Atri restores the light of the sun, a similar feat being elsewhere attributed to his family, the Atris. 11) Av. xiii. 2, 4, 12, 36; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 3, 4, 21. In the Atharvaveda 12) Av. xix. 9, 10; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 351. Rāhu appears for the first time in connexion with the sun. Indra's defeat of Sūrya 6) Macdonell, loc. cit. may also be explained as alluding to an eclipse; in two other passages 13) Rv. iv. 28, 2, 3; v. 33, 4. In x. 27 20, sūro markaḥ means, according to Roth. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and Zimmer, loc. cit., a demon of eclipse; but it may also mean the ‘cleansing’ sun. Av. ii. 10, 8, clearly refers to an eclipse. See Lanman, Festgruss an Roth, 187-190. such an interpretation seems at least probable. Ludwig 14) Proceedings of the Bohemian Academy of Sciences, May, 1885; Translation of the Rigveda, 6, x. not only argues that the Rigveda knows the theory of eclipses caused by an occultation of the sun by the moon, and regards the sun as going round the earth, 15) See Rv. iv. 28, 23; v. 33, 4; x. 37, 3 138, 4. but even endeavours to identify an eclipse referred to in the Rigveda with one that occurred in 1029 B.C. These views are completely refuted by Whitney. 16) Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, October, 1885, xvii (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, lxilxvi); Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, lxxxii, lxxxiii; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 65, 66; Thibaut, Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 6. The sun as a maker of time 17) Rv. v. 81, 1. determines the year of 360 days, which is the civil year and the usual year (Saṃvatsara) of Vedic literature. This solar year is divided into two halves-the Uttarāyaṇa, 18) The form Uttarāyaṇa is later (Manu, vi. 10, etc.). Udagayana occurs in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 3, 1; Kauśika Sūtra, lxvii. 4; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 1, 1; Gobhila Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 1, 3; Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 4, etc.; Weber, Naxatra, 2, 201, 212; Jyotiṣa, 107 et seq.; Yāska, Nirukta, xiv. 10. when the sun goes north, and the Dakṣiṇāyana, 19) The form is late (Manu, i. 67, etc.). In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 3, the two Ayanas are equated each with three seasons--the northern course with spring, summer, and rains; the southern with autumn, winter, and cool season. But this is merely an inevitable inaccuracy, since no real season begins with the winter solstice. when it goes south. There can be no doubt that these periods denote the time when the sun turns north from the winter solstice, and when it turns south from the summer solstice, for the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 20) xix. 3. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 3; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 18 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 2, 18 Kāṇva); Weber, Naxatra, 2, 345 et seq. says so in perfectly clear language. The alternative theory is to regard the periods as those when the sun is in the north--i.e., when it is north of the equator, and when it is in the south, taking as points of departure the equinoxes, not the solstices; but this view has no support in Vedic literature, and is opposed to the fact that the equinoxes play no part in Vedic astronomical theory. 21) Thibaut, Indian Antiquary, 24, 96; Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik,  10; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 631 et seq.; 49, 473 et seq.; Nachrichten der königlichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, 1909, 564, n. 1; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1103. On the other side. see Tilak, Orion, 22-31. There are only doubtful references to the solstices in the Rigveda. 22) See Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 279-283, who cites Rv. i. 61, 15; v. 29, 5; x. 171, 4; 179, 2. But none of these passages are conclusive. Cf. Thibaut, op. cit., 6. The Brāhmaṇas, 23) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 4, 18; iv. 6, 7, 12; x. 6, 2, 3; xi. 1, 6, 19; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 2, 13; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 28, 8. and perhaps the Rigveda, 24) v. 47, 3; ix. 25, 6; 71, 2; x. 55, 5; 138, 4. Cf. Hillebrandt, op. cit., 1, 463-466. regard the moon as entering the sun at new moon. According to Hillebrandt, 25) Ibid., 3, 467, 468. the Rigveda 26) ix. 71, 9; 76, 4; 86, 32; perhaps i. 190, 3; Sāmaveda, ii. 9, 2, 12, 1. Thibaut, op. cit., 6, considers that the meaning of the passages is merely that the moon is filled up during the bright half of the month by light emanating from the sun. recognizes that the moon shines by the borrowed light of the sun, but this seems very doubt ful. See also Aryamṇaḥ Panthā, 27) Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 188, finds in the Rigveda, i. 110, 2, a mention of the inclination of the ecliptic to the equator, and in x. 86, 4, a reference to the axis of the earth. Cf. Tilak, Orion, 158 et seq.; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 102, 105. These views are clearly quite wrong. The notions of the sun given in the Brāhmaṇas are all very naive and simple; the distance of heaven and the sun from the earth is the height of a thousand cows one on the top of the other (Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 8, 6), or forty-four days' journey for a horse (ibid., xxv. 10, 16), or a thousand days' journey for a horse (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 17, 8), or a hundred leagues (Kausītaki Brāhmaṇa, viii. 3). They record also such facts as that the sun rises from and sets in the waters (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 20, 13; of. Nirukta, vi. 17; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxiv. 4, 5; xxvi. 1), and that it sets in the west (ibid., xviii. 9). The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa calls the sun circular (vii. 4, 1, 17), and also fourcornered (catuḥ-śrakti) in xiv. 3, 1, 17, and so on. See Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 358 et seq. Nakṣatra, and Sapta Sūryāḥ.

suuryanaxatra|सूर्यनक्षत्र
सूर्य-नक्षत्र<BR> is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1) ii. 1, 2, 19. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 288. in a passage where Sāyaṇa takes it as denoting a Nakṣatra, which gives out rays of light like the sun. But the real sense (as the Kāṇva text helps to show) is that the sacrificer may take the sun for his Nakṣatra--i.e., he may neglect the Nakṣatras altogether and rely on the sun.

suuryachandramasaa|सूर्यचन्द्रमसा
सूर्य-चन्द्रमसा<BR> or Sūrya-candramasau denotes ‘sun and moon’ as a pair of luminaries in the Rigveda 1) i. 102, 2; v. 51, 15; x. 190, 3. and later. 2) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 8, 9; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vii. 12, 1. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 293; Jyotiṣa 28, 50; Indische Studien, 9, 112.

sRka|सृक
सृक<BR> in a couple of passages of the Rigveda 1) i. 32, 12; x. 180, 2. Cf. sṛkāyin, sṛkā-hasta, ‘bearing a lance in his hand,’ in the Śatarudriya, Vājasaneya Saṃhitā, xvi. 21, 61, etc. denotes a weapon of Indra, perhaps a ‘lance.’

sRgaala|सृगाल
सृगाल<BR> , ‘jackal,’ is not found until the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa xii. 5, 2, 5), but is common in the Epic. 

sRjaya|सृजय
सृजय<BR> is the name of one of the victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 14, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 14; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 23. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99. What it was is unknown: Mahīdhara on the Vājasaneyi passage calls it a kind of bird; Sāyaṇa on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā gives the alternatives ‘black fly’ (when sṛjayā must be read), ‘white serpent,’ and ‘black buffalo.’

sRnjaya|सृञ्जय
सृञ्जय<BR> is the name of a people mentioned as early as the Rigveda. Sṛñjaya (that is, the king of this people) Daivavāta is celebrated as victorious over the Turvaśas and the Vṛcīvants, 1) Rv. vi. 27, 7. and his sacrificial fire is referred to. 2) Rv. iv. 15, 4. In connexion with Daivavāta is also mentioned Sāhadevya Somaka, 3) Rv. iv. 15, 7. no doubt another prince; for in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 4) vii. 34, 9. we find Somaka Sāhadevya and his father, Sahadeva (originally Suplan) Sārñjaya, as kings who were anointed by Parvata and Nārada. The Rigveda 5) Rv. vi. 47, 22. 25. has also a Dānastuti (‘praise of gifts’) of Prastoka, 6) Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sutra, xvi. 11, 11. a Sṛñjaya, who is lauded along with Divodāsa. Moreover, Vītahavya 7) Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 212; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105. seems to have been a Sṛñjaya, though Zimmer 8) Altindisches Leben, 132 (on vaitahavya). prefers to take the derivative word, Vaitahavya, not as a patronymic, but as an epithet. It seems probable that the Sṛñjayas and the Tṛtsus were closely allied, for Divodāsa and a Sṛñjaya prince are celebrated together, 9) Cf. also the connexion of the Bharad vājas and Divodāsa (Rv. vi. 16, 5; 31, 4; Hillebrandt, op. cit., 1, 104), and their connexion with the Sṛñjayas (Vītahavya in Rv. vi. 15, 2. 3, and see vi. 27, 7, both passages that can safely be accepted as derived from the Bharadvāja family). and the Turvaśas were enemies of both. 10) See, on the one hand, Rv. vii. 18 (Turvaśas and Tṛtsus), and, on the other, vi. 27, 7. This view is borne out by the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 11) ii. 4, 4, 5. which recognizes Devabhāga Śrautarṣa as Purohita of the Kurus and the Sṛñjayas. On the other hand, some disaster certainly befel the Sṛñjayas, at least the Vaitahavyas, for they are said in the Atharvaveda 12) v. 19, 1. Cf. v. 18, 10. 11. to have offended the Bhṛgus and to have ended miserably. There is, it is true, no precise confirmation of this notice, but both the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 13) xii. 3. and the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 14) vi. 6, 2, 2, 3. in independent passages, refer to the Sṛñjayas having sustained some serious loss, though the notice is in each case coupled with a ritual error, much as in the Old Testament the fate of kings depends on their devotion to Jahve or their disobedience. It is justifiable to recognize some disaster in this allusion. The geographical position of the Sṛñjayas is uncertain. Hillebrandt 15) Op. cit., 1, 106. suggests that in early times they must be looked for west of the Indus with Divodāsa; he also mentions, though he does not definitely adopt, the suggestion of Brunnhofer that the Sṛñjayas are to be compared with the  16) Herodotus has the form  and , Strabo and Arrian . The Avestic is zrayaṅk, Old Persian daraya. The Indian s is curious if the words are parallel (see, however, Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 25, 11; Oldenberg, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1098). of the Greeks, and to be located in Drangiana. Zimmer 17) Altindisches Leben, 132, 133; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 232. This is a guess from Rv. i. 100, where Sahadeva occurs and the Sindhu is mentioned. is inclined to locate them on the upper Indus; but it is difficult to decide definitely in favour of any particular location. They may well have been a good deal farther east than the Indus, since their allies, the Tṛtsus, were in the Madhyadeśa, and were certainly absorbed in the Kurus. Of the history of this clan we have one notice. 18) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 9, 3, 1 et seq. They expelled Duṣṭarītu Pauṃsāyana, one of their kings, from the hereditary monarchy--of ten generations--and also drove out Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra Sthapati, probably his minister, who, however, succeeded in effecting the restoration of the king, despite the opposition of the Kuru prince, Balhika Prātīpya. Very probably this Kuru prince may have been at the bottom of the movement which led to the expulsion of the king and his minister. But the restoration of the king can hardly be regarded, in accordance with Bloomfield's view, 19) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 433. So also Zimmer, op. cit., 132. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 208; 3, 472; 18, 237; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 31; Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 153; Oldenberg, Buddha 405. as a defeat of the Sṛñjayas.

sRNii|सृणी
सृणी¤<BR> is found certainly in one, 1) i. 58, 4, where sṛṇyā, according to Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 116, n. 1, and to Pischel, ibid., 2, 111, stands for sṛṇyābhiḥ, and, as an adjective agreeing with juhūbhiḥ, means ‘sickle-shaped sacrificial ladles.’ But this is very doubtful. and probably also in two other 2) x. 101, 3 (Nirukta, v. 28); 106, 6 (ibid., xiii. 5). It is certain in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 2, 2, 5. passages of the Rigveda. The sense appears to be ‘sickle.’ In one other passage Sṛṇya is coupled with jetā: 3) iv. 20, 5. the sense is doubtful, Roth 4) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 111. conjecturing cetā, and Oldenberg 5) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 284. pointing out that chettā is also possible. Hopkins 6) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 86, n. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238: Oldenberg, op. cit., 1, 58. thinks that a ‘hook’ is here meant.

sRNya|सृण्य
सृण्य<BR> See Sṛṇī.

sRbinda|सृबिन्द
सृबिन्द<BR> is the name of a foe of Indra 1) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 162. in the Rigveda. 2) viii. 32, 2. The word may denote a real foe, since it has no obvious Āryan derivation.

sRmara|सृमर
सृमर<BR> is the name of an unknown animal at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhita, v. 5, 16, 1 (according to Sāyaṇa = camara); Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 20; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 39 (where Mahīdhara identifies it with the Gavaya). 

setu|सेतु
सेतु<BR> appears in the Rigveda 1) ix. 41, 2. and later 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 2, 1; vi. 1, 4, 9; 5, 3, 3; vii. 5, 8, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxviii. 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 35; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 2, 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2, 10, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 4, 24; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 4, 1. 2, etc. to denote merely a raised bank for crossing inundated land, 3) Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 1, 130, n. 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 257. a ‘causeway,’ such as are common all the world over. This sense explains best the later meaning of ‘boundary.’ The word in Vedic literature is probably always metaphorical.

senaa|सेना
सेना<BR> denotes primarily a ‘missile,’ a sense found in the Rigveda 1) Rv. i. 66, 7; 116, 1 (senā-jū, ‘swift as an arrow’); 143, 5; 186, 9; ii. 33, 11; v. 30, 9; vii. 3, 4; viii. 75, 7; x. 23, 1. and the Atharvaveda, 2) viii. 8, 7; xi. 10, 4. and then a ‘host’ or ‘army,’ which is its normal meaning. 3) Rv. i. 33, 6; vii. 25, 1; ix. 96, 1; x. 103, 1. 4. 7; 142, 4; 156, 2; Av. iii. 1, 1; 19, 6; iv. 19, 2; v. 21, 9, etc. Cf. von Bradke, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 46, 456; Bloomfield, ibid., 48, 549, 550; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 231, n. 2, denies that Senā ever means ‘missile,’ and compares exercitus effusus, agmen effusum. See Saṃgrāma.

senaanii|सेनानी
सेना-नी,<BR> ‘leader of an army,’ is the title of the royal ‘general.’ He is mentioned in the Rigveda, 1) vii. 20, 5; ix. 96, 1; x. 84, 2. where also 2) x. 34, 12 (the gambling hymn). the word is used metaphorically. He is also referred to in the Śatarudriya, 3) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 17; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 11; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 4; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 2, 1. as well as elsewhere in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas. 4) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xv. 15; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 9; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 8, 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, viii. 6, 1, 21. He is one of the Ratnins of the king. 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 9, 1; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 3, 4; Maitrayaṇ Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 5; iv. 3, 8; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 4; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 1, 1. Presumably he was appointed by the king, not by the people, to command in war when the king became too important to lead every little fray in person. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 6) viii. 23, 10. this official is called Senā-pati. 

selaga|सेलग
सेलग<BR> in the Brāhmaṇas 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 1, 5; viii. 11, 8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 3, 10. appears to denote ‘robber.’ See Sailaga.

sehu|सेहु
सेहु<BR> occurs in a comparison in the Atharvaveda, 1) vii. 76, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 54; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 441. where it must denote a very sapless (arasa) substance.

saitava|सैतव
सैतव,<BR> ‘descendant of Setu,’ is the name of a teacher in the first two Vaṃśas (list of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) ii. 5, 21; iv. 5, 27 Mādhyaṃdina; ii. 6, 2 Kāṇva. He is described as a pupil of Pārāśarya or of Pārāśaryāyaṇa. 2) iv. 6, 2 Kāṇva.

saindhava|सैन्धव
सैन्धव,<BR> ‘coming from the Indus,’ is a term applied to water in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 1) vii. 4, 13, 1. to Guggulu in the Atharvaveda, 2) xix. 38, 2. to a horse in the Śatapatha, Brāhmaṇa, 3) xi. 5, 5, 12; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 2, 13 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 1, 13 Kāṇva). and to salt in the same text. 4) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 4, 12 (ºkhilya); iv. 5, 13 (ºghana).

sairya|सैर्य
सैर्य<BR> is the name in the Rigveda 1) i. 191, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72. of some species of grass infested by insects.

sailaga|सैलग
सैलग<BR> is found in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 1) xxx. 18. and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 2) iii. 4, 16, 1; Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 23 (also spelt Śailaga) Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 367, n. 4. as the name of one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’). ‘Robber’ seems to be the sense of this word, as of Selaga. 

sobhari|सोभरि
सोभरि<BR> is the name of a Ṛṣi frequently mentioned in the Rigveda. 1) viii. 5, 26; 19, 2; 20, 19; 22, 2. The family is also referred to, 2) Rv. viii. 19, 32; 20, 8. and a father, Sobharī. 3) Rv. viii. 22, 15. Cf. viii. 103, 14; Av. xviii. 3, 15. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 105; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 217.

soma|सोम
सोम<BR> was the famous plant which was used for the preparation of the libation of Soma made at the Vedic sacrifice. Its importance is sufficiently shown by the fact that the whole of the ninth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda, and six hymns in other Maṇḍalas, are devoted to its praise. Nevertheless, little is actually known of the plant. Its twigs or shoots are described as brown (babhru), 1) The word is not actually found applied to the plant itself; but the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ix. 5, 3, prescribes arjunāni, plants of this indefinite colour, as a substitute for Soma, if Pūtīkas cannot be obtained. ruddy (aruṇa), 2) Rv. vii. 98, 1; x. 94, 3; 144, 5. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5, 10, 1 et seq. of tawny (hari). 3) Rv. ix. 92, 1. The Soma cow, with which Soma was purchased, is called babhru or aruṇā, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 1, 15; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 7, 5, etc. Possibly its twigs hang down if the epithet Naicāśākha 4) Rv. iii. 53, 14. Cf. Naicāśākha. refers to the plant as Hillebrandt 5) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 14-18; 2, 241-245. thinks. The shoot is called aṃśu, 6) Rv. i. 168, 3 iii. 48, 2, etc. while the plant as a whole is called andhas, 7) Rv. i. 28, 7; iii. 48, 1; iv. 16, 1, etc. which also denotes the juice. 8) ii. 14, 1; 19, 1; 35, 1. etc. Parvan 9) Rv. i. 9, 1. Cf. parus, Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, 13; Vaitāna Sūtra, 24. is the stem. Kṣip, 10) Rv. ix. 79, 4. Cf., however, Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 70. ‘finger,’ is used as a designation of the shoots, which may therefore have resembled fingers in shape; vakṣaṇā 11) Rv. viii. 1, 17. and vāṇa 12) Rv. iv. 24, 9; ix. 50, 1. But these passages are both very doubtful. Cf. Vāṇa. The husk left after the pressing is called andhas (ix. 86, 44; vavri (ix. 69, 9), tvac (ix. 86, 44; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, 13, 1), śarīva (ibid., 2), śarya (ix. 68, 2), tānva (ix. 78, 1). also seem to have the sense of the shoot. There is some slight. evidence to suggest that the stem was not round, but angular. 13) Cf. pṛṣṭhya in Rv. iv. 20, 4; Hille brandt, 1, 54, 55. The plant grew on the mountains, 14) Rv. i. 93, 6; iii. 48, 2; v. 36, 2; 43, 4; 85, 2; ix. 18, 1; 46, 1; 71, 4; 82, 3; Av. iii. 21, 10. So in the Avesta, Yasna, x. 4, etc. that of Müjavant being specially renowned. These notices are inadequate to identify the plant. It has been held 15) Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 931; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 261 et seq. Cf. Haug, Aitareya Brahmaṇa, 2, 489; Max Müller, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 9, liv. to be the Sarcostemma viminale or the Asclepias acida (= Sarcostemma brevistigma). Roth 16) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 35, 680 et seq. Cf. also 38, 134 et seq. held that the Sarcostemma acidum more nearly met the requirements of the case. Watt 17) See Hillebrandt, 1, 7 et seq. suggested the Afghan grape as the real Soma, and Rice 18) Ibid., 10. thought a sugar-cane might be meant, while Max Müller and Rājendralāla Mitra suggested that the juice was used as an ingredient in a kind of beer--i.e., that the Soma plant was a species of hop. Hillebrandt 19) Ibid., 12. The dispute between Max Müller, Roth, J. G. Baker, W. T. Thiselton Dyer, Charles G. Leland, and A. Houtum-Schindler, as to the identity of the plant, is reprinted in Max Müller's Biographies of Words, 222 et seq., and reviewed by Hillebrandt. See also Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, xxiv. et seq., who thinks that the traditional identification is not far wrong. Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, 188, gives it as Sarcostemma acidum. considers that neither hops nor the grape can explain the references to Soma. It is very probable that the plant cannot now be identified. 20) The original Soma plant was, doubtless, identical with the Haoma of the Avesta. On the plant from which the present Parsis of Kermān and Yezd obtain their Hūm juice, and which they regard as identical with the Avestic Haoma, see Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, xxiv et seq. In the Yajurveda 21) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 1, 1 et seq.; Hillebrandt, 1, 89 et seq. the plant is purchased ere it is pressed. Hillebrandt 22) Ibid., 70. considers that the sale must be assumed for the Rigveda. It grew on a mountain, and could not be obtained by ordinary people: perhaps some special tribe or prince owned it, like the Kīkaṭas. 23) Rv. iii. 53, 14. As it stands, the ritual performance is clearly an acquisition of the Soma from the Gandharvas (represented by a Śūdra), a ritual imitation of the action which may have been one of the sources of the drama. Owing to the difficulty of obtaining the real plant from a great distance, several substitutes were allowed in the Brāhmaṇa period. 24) See Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5, 10, 1-6, and cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, xxvii; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ix. 5, 3. The plant was prepared for use by being pounded with stones or in a mortar. The former was the normal method of procedure, appearing in the Rigveda as the usual one. The stones are called grāvan 25) i. 83, 6; 135, 7, etc. or adri, 26) i. 130, 2; 135, 5; 137, 1, etc. Adri is used oftener with the verb su, ‘press,’ than grāvan, which is more personally conceived, and so appears with vad, ‘speak,’ and so forth; Hillebrandt, 1, 153, n. 1. and were, of course, held in the hands. 27) Rv. v. 45, 7; ix. 11, 5; x. 76, 2, etc. The plant was laid on boards one beside the other (Adhiṣavana), and, according at least to the later ritual, 28) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 4, 28; that ākhara, Rv. x. 94, 5, denotes this is uncertain. a hole was dug below, so that the pounding of the plant by means of the stones resulted in a loud noise, doubtless a prophylactic against demoniac influences. The plant was placed on a skin and on the Vedi 29) Rv. v. 31, 12.<BR> --which was no longer done in the later ritual--Dhiṣaṇā in some passages denoting the Vedi. 30) Rv. i. 109, 3; iii. 2, 1; vi. 11, 3, etc. Sometimes the mortar and pestle were used in place of the stones. 31) Rv. i. 28. The pestle is manthā, the mortar ulūkhala; in x. 101, 11, vanaspati and vana may have the same senses respectively. This use, though Iranian, was apparently not common in Vedic times.

chamuu|चमू
चमू<BR> denotes the vessel used for the offering to the god, 32) Not the pressing boards, which are unknown in the Rigveda. Cf. Rv. ix. 99, 8; x. 91, 15, etc. Kalaśa and Camasa those used for the priests to drink from. Sometimes 33) Rv. i. 28, 9; iv. 18, 3; vi. 57, 2, etc.; Hillebrandt, 1, 170, 173. the Camū denotes the mortar and pestle. Perhaps the vessel was so called because of its mortar-like shape. The skin on which the shoots were placed was called Tvac, 34) Rv. ix. 65, 25; 66, 29; 70, 7; 79, 4, etc. or twice go (‘cow-hide’). 35) Rv. x. 94, 9; 116, 4. Kośa, 36) Rv. vii. 101, 4; viii. 20, 8, etc. It denotes the larger vessel from which the Soma is poured into the Kalaśas, or cups. Sadhastha, 37) Rv. iii. 62, 15; ix. 1, 2; 17, 8, etc. Dru, 38) Rv. ix. 1, 2; 65, 6; 98, 2; in x. 101, 10, dru = mortar. Vana, 39) Rv. ii. 14, 9; ix. 66, 9, etc. The word can mean both the vessel into which the Soma was poured after preparation, and the vessel from which it was offered to the gods. Droṇa, 40) Rv. ix. 15, 7; 33, 2, etc. The word, having no definite sense, can denote any of the vessels. The camū, on the other hand, was the cup for the gods, the kalaśa that for the priests (later it was also used as = kośa, when camasa had replaced kalaśa as cup for the priests; Hillebrandt, 1, 187). are all terms used for Soma vessels, while Sruva 41) Rv. i. 116, 24. Cf. also Amatra and Khārī. denotes the ‘ladle.’ Apparently the plant was sometimes steeped in water to increase its yield of juice. 42) This process is technically called āpyāyana, ‘causing to swell.’ Cf. Rv. ix. 74, 9; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 5. The exact nature and extent of this process is quite uncertain; Hillebrandt, 193-195; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, xxvi. It is not possible to describe exactly the details of the process of pressing the Soma as practised in the Rigveda. It was certainly purified by being pressed through a sieve 43) Whether the later practice of purification by means of shoots held in the hands was known to the Rigveda is uncertain, since ii. 14, 8; ix. 71, 3, are quite indecisive. For the various terms used to designate the sieve, see Pavitra. (Pavitra). The Soma was then used unmixed (śukra, 44) Rv. i. 137, 1; iii. 32, 2; viii. 2, 10, etc. śuci) 45) Rv. i. 5, 5; 30, 2; viii. 2, 9, etc. for Indra and Vāyu, but the Kaṇvas seem to have dropped this usage. 46) Cf. Rv. viii. 2, 5. 9. 10, 28, etc. The Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 7, 4, disapproves of the unmixed Soma. Possibly Hillebrandt, 1, 207, 208, may be right in thinking that the Kāṇvas had to lay special stress on the use of the mixtures, because they used a plant which was deficient in the true Soma character. The juice is described as brown (babhru), 47) Rv. ix. 33, 2; 63, 4. 6. tawny (hari), 48) Rv. ix. 3, 9; 7, 6; 65, 8. 12. 25, etc. or ruddy (aruṇa), 49) Rv. ix. 40, 2; 45, 3; aruṣa, ix. 61, 21; śoṇa, ix. 97, 13. and as having a fragrant smell, 50) ix. 97, 19; 107, 2. at least as a rule. 51) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 3, 6. This passage has been relied on by Eggeling, op. cit., 26, xxv, as a confirmation of the later description, in a medical work, of the plant as illsmelling. But this plant may have been a different one from that used in Vedic times. The smell may have been due to a substitute being used, or to the genuine plant, brought from a distance, being old and withered. Soma was mixed with milk (Gavāśir), 52) Hillebrandt, 1, 219-222. curd or sour milk (Dadhyāśir), 53) Ibid., 221. or grain (Yavāśir). 54) Ibid., 222 et seq. The admixtures are alluded to with various figurative expressions, as Atka, ‘armour’; 55) Rv. ix. 69, 4. Vastra 56) ix. 8, 6. or Vāsas, 57) ix. 69, 5. ‘garment’; Abhiśrī, 58) ix. 79, 5; 86, 27. ‘admixture’; rūpa, 59) Av. ix. 25, 4. ‘beauty’; śrī, 60) Rv. iv. 41, 8; ix. 16, 6. ‘splendour’; rasa, 61) Rv. iii. 48, 1; vi. 47, 1; ix. 97, 14. See also Sūda. ‘flavour’; prayas, 62) Rv. iii. 30, 1; ix. 46, 3; 66, 23. ‘dainty’; and perhaps nabhas, 63) Rv. ix. 83, 5; 97, 21, etc. ‘fragrance.’ The adjective tīvra 64) Rv. i. 23, 1; ii. 41, 14; v. 37, 4; vi. 47, 1, etc. denotes the ‘pungent’ flavour of Soma when so mixed. The Soma shoots, after the juice has been pressed out, are denoted by ṛjīṣa, ‘residue.’ 65) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 8, 5; Av. ix. 6, 16, etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 72; citation in Nirukta, v. 12, etc. Ṛjīṣa as an adjective occurs in Rv. i. 32, 6, and ṛjīṣin in the Rigveda means, according to Hillebrandt, 1, 236, 237, generally ‘one to whom the Soma shoots belong.’ Soma tiroahnya is ‘Soma pressed the day before yesterday.’ It seems probable that in some cases honey was mixed with Soma: perhaps the kośa madhu-ścut, ‘the pail distilling sweetness,’ was used for the mixing. 66) Rv. ix. 103, 3. Cf. ix. 17, 8; ix. 86, 48; 97, 11; 109, 20. It seems doubtful if Surā was ever so mixed. 67) See Surāma. Cf. Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 12, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 42, and surā-somā, ibid., xxi. 60. There were three pressings a day of Soma, as opposed to the two of the Avesta. 68) Yasna, x. 2. The evening pressing was specially connected with the Ṛbhus, the midday with Indra, the morning with Agni, but the ritual shows that many other gods also had their share. 69) Hillebrandt, 1, 257 et seq. The drinker of Soma and the nondrinker are sharply discriminated in the texts. 70) Rv. i. 110, 7; ii. 30, 7; v. 34, 3. 5; iv. 17, 17; 25, 6. 7; v. 37, 3; vi. 41, 4; vii. 26, 1, etc. There were also rivalries with other Soma sacrifices, Rv. ii. 18, 3; viii. 33, 14; 66, 12, and especially vii. 33, 2, where the Vasiṣṛhas take away Indra from Pāśadyumna Vāyata's Soma sacrifice to Sudās'. Many famous Soma offerers are mentioned: Atri, v. 51, 8; 72, 1; viii. 42, 5; Śāryāta, i. 51, 12; iii. 51, 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vii. 35; Śīṣṭas, viii. 53, 4, etc.; Turvaśa Yadu, viii. 45, 27; Saṃvarta Kṛśa, viii. 54, 2; Nīpātithi, Medhyātithi, Puṣṭigu, Śruṣṭigu, viii. 51, 1, etc. The ritual lays stress on the need of continuity in Soma-drinking in a family: Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 5, 5 et seq.; Maitrāvaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 5, etc. Localities where Soma was consumed were Ārjīka, Pastyāvant, Śaryaṇāvant, Suṣomā, the territory of the Pañcajanāḥ or ‘five peoples,’ and so on. 71) See s.v.; Hillebrandt, 1, 125-143. It is possible that Soma may have grown on the mountains to the north of Madhyadeśa, whatever may have been its original home, on which cf. Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 38, 134 et seq. The effects of Soma in exhilarating and exciting the drinkers are often alluded to. 72) See Rv. viii. 48. It was equally prized in Avestic times. It is, however, seldom spoken of as giving the priests pleasure: Rv. i. 91, 13; viii. 2, 12; x. 167, 3. There are many references to sickness caused by it (Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 13 etc.). The Sautrāmaṇī was a rite designed to expiate the ill caused by vomiting Soma as Indra had done: Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 2, 5, 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 4, 9; xii. 7, 1, 11. The name of the rite is already found in Av. vii. 3, 2, and the rite itself is no doubt older (see also Viṣūcikā). This fact tells in favour of the traditional identification of the plant, for the medical passage quoted by Max Müller refers to its producing vomiting. See also Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 275; Rv. i. 91, 13; 118, 3; viii. 2, 12; 17, 6; 48, 12. Perhaps Vamra in i. 112, 15, got his name thence. It is difficult to decide if Soma was ever a popular, as opposed to a hieratic drink. The evidence for its actual popularity is very slight, 73) Rv. viii. 69, 8-10. Cf. viii. 31, 5; i. 28, 5; Hillebrandt, 1, 143-147. The evidence is not decisive; the ordinary Soma sacrifice was clearly a sacrifice of rich patrons. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 272280; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 1-266; 2, 209 et seq.; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 104 et seq. and not decisive.

सौदास<BR> in the plural designates the ‘descendants of Sudās,’ who are referred to in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa 1) ii. 390 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 47). The story must have appeared in the Śāṭyāyanaka also. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 159, n. 3. as having cast Śakti, the son of Vasiṣṭha, into the fire. Other texts 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 7, 1; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, iv. 8; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iv. 7, 3. See also Caland, U7ber das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 20. relate that Vasiṣṭha, his son being slain, desired to avenge himself on the Saudāsas, and eventually succeeded. Geldner 3) Loc. cit. sees a reference to the story in the Rigveda, 4) iii. 53, 22. but without cause.

In i. 87, 1, it seems to denote a ‘star-like spot’ on the forehead of a cow or bull, but this is uncertain. Cf. Grassmann, Wörterbuch, s.v.; above, 1, 233. 

stega|स्तेग
स्तेग<BR> in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 7, 11, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxv. 1. seems to denote a species of ‘worm.’ The word occurs in the Rigveda 2) x. 31, 9 = Av. xviii. 1, 39. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98. also, where its sense is unknown, but may possibly be ‘ploughshare.’ 3) Weber, Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1895, 833. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 824.

stena|स्तेन
स्तेन<BR> is a common word for ‘thief’ from the Rigveda 1) ii. 23, 16; 28, 10; 42, 3, etc. onwards. 2) Av. iv. 3, 4, 5; 36, 7; xix. 47, 6; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 30, 11, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 178 et seq. See Taskara.

stotR|स्तोतृ
स्तोतृ<BR> denotes ‘praiser’ or ‘panegyrist’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 11, 3; 38, 4; iii. 18, 5; vi. 34, 3, etc. and later. 2) Av. vi. 2, 1; xix. 48, 4. The word often 3) Rv. i. 124, 10; ii. 1, 16; v. 64, 1; vii. 7, 7; Nirukta, vii. 2. occurs in connexion with patrons, the Maghavan or Sūri.

stotra|स्तोत्र
स्तोत्र<BR> denotes the ‘song’ of the Udgātṛ and his assistant priests (see Ṛtvij), just as Śastra denotes the ‘recitation’ of the Hotṛ and his assistants. The word has this technical sense quite frequently in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 2, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxix. 2; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 37, 4; iii. 46, 8; iv. 12, 6; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 1, 7; viii. 1, 3, 4, etc. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 353, and Caland and Henry, L'Agniṣṭoma, where the Stotras for that sacrifice are given at length. 

stoma|स्तोम
स्तोम<BR> denotes ‘song of praise’ in the Rigveda. 1) i. 114, 9; iii. 5, 2; 58, 1, etc. Later 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 2, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ix. 33; x. 10, etc. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 229, 276; 10, 355; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 101. the term has the technical sense of the typical forms in which the Stotras are chanted.

strii|स्त्री
स्त्री<BR> is the ordinary word in poetry and prose for ‘woman,’ without special reference to her as a wife or as a maiden. Nārī has the same sense, but disappears in later prose, while Gnā refers only to the wives of the gods, and Yoṣit, with its cognate words, denotes the young woman as ripe for marriage. 1) Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtsehaftsnamen, 417. In the Rigveda 2) Rv. i. 164, 16; v. 61, 8, etc. So also often later--e.g., Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 7, 4; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 8, 2. Strī stands opposed to Pumāṃs, ‘man,’ and once to vṛṣan, ‘male person’; not until the Atharvaveda 3) xii. 2, 39. Cf. Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 22, 1. does it mean ‘wife’ as opposed to Pati, ‘husband,’ and even in the Sūtras it is sharply opposed to Jāyā. In Vedic India by far the greater part of a woman's life was taken up in her marriage and marital relations (see Pati and Mātṛ). There is no trace in the Rigveda of the seclusion of women, which was practically complete in all but the earliest Epic: 4) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 349, 350. the maiden may be assumed to have grown up in her father's house, enjoying free intercourse with the youth of the village, and sharing in the work of the house. Education 5) Cf. Hopkins, op. cit., 351, 352. See Gārgī Vācaknavī and others enumerated in the Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 4, 4; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 118, 119. was not denied to them, at any rate in certain cases, for we hear in the Upaniṣads of women who could take no unimportant part in disputations on philosophical topics. Moreover, women were taught to dance and sing, which were unmanly accomplishments. 6) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 6, 5, Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 7, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 4, 3-6. Of the exact legal position of daughters the notices are few and meagre. The Rigveda, 7) i. 124, 7. Cf. Av. i. 14, 2; 17, 1; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 328; Hopkins, op. cit., 341, and see Syāla, Putrikā. however, shows that in the place of a father the brother was looked to for aid, and that brotherless maidens were apt to be ruined, though religious terrors were believed to await the man who took advantage of their defencelessness. 8) Rv. iv. 5, 5. Moreover, women could not take an inheritance, 9) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 8, 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 6, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 4, 2, 13; Nirukta, iii. 4. and were not independent persons in the eyes of the law, whether married or not. Presumably before marriage they lived on their parents or brothers, and after that on their husbands, while in the event of their husbands predeceasing them, their relatives took the property, burdened with the necessity of maintaining the wife. 10) Cf. the Attic , Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1912, 427. Their earnings would be appropriated by their nearest relative--usually father or brother -in the few cases in which unmarried women could earn anything, as in the case of courtezans.

sthapati|स्थपति
स्थ-पति<BR> is the name of a royal official mentioned in the Atharvaveda, 1) ii. 32, 4; v. 23, 11 (of the chief of the worms in both cases). and often later. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 2, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 12; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 19; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 11, 6. 7; xxiv. 18, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 4, 17, etc. Revottaras Cākra was the Sthapati of the exiled Duṣṭarītu Pauṃsāyana, a king of the Sṛñjayas, and succeeded in restoring him to his royal dignity. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 8, 1, 17; 9, 3, 1 et seq. Sthapati here is part, as it were, of the name of the man. The exact sense of the term is not certain: ‘governor’ 4) In the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 1, 12; Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, ix. 14, 12, is found Niṣāda-sthapati; perhaps ‘governor of Niṣādas.’ But it may also mean (cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 207, n.) a Niṣāda as a Sthapati; thus, little can be deduced from this passage in particular. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 111, renders it ‘governor.’ Cf. also St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and Aupoditi. is possible, but perhaps ‘chief judge’ 5) Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 13, n. 3; 13, 203; 17, 200; 18, 260; U7ber den Rājasūya, 15, n. 6; U7ber den Vājapeya, 9, 10. Cf. Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxii. 5, 28; 11, 11; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 7, 11; Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, xxii. 7, 6. is more likely; as in the case of the early English judges, his functions may have been both executive and judicial. He is inferior in position to the king's brother. 6) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 4, 17. 

sthavira|स्थविर
स्थविर,<BR> literally ‘elder,’ is used as a sort of epithet of several men; Sthavira Śākalya occurs in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka 1) iii. 2, 1. 6. and the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 2) vii. 16; viii. 1. 11. and Sthavira Jātūkarṇya in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa. 3) xxvi. 5. Cf. the names Hrasva and Dīrgha.

sthaagara|स्थागर
स्थागर<BR> in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 1) ii. 3, 10, 2; Apastamba Śrauta Sūtra, xiv. 15, 2. is applied to an ornament (alaṃkāra) meaning ‘made of the fragrant substance Sthagara,’ which elsewhere 2) See Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 198; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 311, n. 2; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 265. appears as Sthakara.

sthaaNu|स्थाणु
स्थाणु<BR> in the Rigveda 1) x. 40, 13. and later 2) Av. x. 4, 1; xiv. 2, 48; xix. 49, 10, etc. denotes a ‘stump’ or ‘post’ of wood.

sthaatR|स्थातृ

स्यन्दन,<BR> ‘chariot,’ is found in the earlier literature only, if at all, in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) iii. 53, 19, according to Roth. A wood called Syandana seems to be meant in the Kauśika Sūtra, viii. 15. where Spandana is the received reading. 

syaala|स्याल
स्याल,<BR> a word occurring in only one passage of the Rigveda, 1) i. 109, 2. appears to denote the brother of a man's wife, who is regarded as willing to protect her, and so secure a marriage for her. 2) So Sāyaṇa on Rv., loc. cit.

sraaktya|स्राक्त्य
स्राक्त्य<BR> is an adjective describing an amulet (Maṇi) in the Atharvaveda. 1) viii. 5, 4. 7. 8. Cf. ii. 11. According to Weber, 2) Indische Studien, 13, 164. it designates a crystal (literally ‘many-cornered’). The commentators, 3) See Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 7, 477; Hymns of the Athar vaveda, 577. however, agree in explaining the word to mean ‘derived from the Sraktya’--i.e., from the Tilaka tree (Clerodendrum phlomoides).

sruch|स्रुच्
स्रुच्<BR> denotes a ‘large wooden sacrificial ladle’ (used for pouring clarified butter on the fire) in the Rigveda 1) i. 84, 18; 110, 6; 144, 1, etc. and later. 2) Av. v. 27, 5; vi. 114, 3; ix. 6, 17, etc. Cf. for its shape, etc., Max Müller, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 9, xli, lxxx; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 67; 26, 20, 23.

Weber, 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 2, 89, n. and Zimmer 5) Altindisches Leben, 95. prefer to derive it from the root svaj, ‘clasp,’ ‘encircle.’ In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 6) iii. 9, 3. the Hariṇa is said to kill the viper.

svadhiti|स्वधिति
1. Svadhiti in the Rigveda 1) i. 162, 9. 18. 20. denotes the ‘axe’ or ‘knife’ used for dissecting the sacrificial horse. In all the other passages in that Saṃhitā 2) ii. 39, 7; iii. 2, 10; 8, 6, 11; v. 7, 8; vii. 3, 9; viii. 102, 19; x. 89, 7. Cf. n. 8. the sense of ‘axe’ for cutting wood is adequate; reference is made in one place 3) ii. 39, 7. to sharpening the axe on the whetstone (kṣṇotra). In the Atharvaveda 4) vi. 141, 2. Cf. Mantra Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 7; Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 386, 387; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 159, who is inclined to compare Paraśu in Rv. iii. 53, 22. the term seems once to denote the copper (lohita) 5) Geldner, loc. cit., understands this word to mean ‘red-hot.’ knife used to mark the ears of cattle; the carpenter's knife or axe is also twice referred to there. 6) ix. 4, 6 (probably so to be taken); xii. 3, 33. In xviii. 2, 35, the sense is quite different. See Whitney, op. cit., 845. Later the word means ‘axe’ generally. 7) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 3, 3, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ii. 15 (the slaughteringknife); v. 43 (the axe to fell the tree) etc. As a weapon it does not appear at all. 8) In Rv. x. 92, 15, Svadhiti may refer to the thunderbolt of Indra.

svadhiti|स्वधिति
2. Svadhiti in certain passages of the Rigveda 1) v. 32, 10; ix. 96, 6. Cf. i. 88, 2. denotes, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, a great tree with hard wood. This interpretation seems probable.

svanadratha|स्वनद्रथ
स्वनद्-रथ<BR> (‘having a rattling car’) is taken by Ludwig 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159. as a proper name of Āsaṅga in the Rigveda. 2) viii. 1, 32. But the word is most probably only an epithet. 

svanayabhaavya|स्वनयभाव्य
स्वनय भाव्य<BR> is the name of a prince on the Sindhu (Indus) who bestowed gifts on Kakṣīvant, according to the Rigveda (i. 126, 1. 3). He is called Svanaya Bhāvayavya in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xvi. 11, 5).

स्वप्न,<BR> ‘dream,’ is referred to in the Rigveda 1) ii. 28, 10; x. 162, 6. and later. 2) Av. vii. 101, 1; x. 3, 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xx. 16; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 2, 23, etc. Evil dreams 3) Rv. ii. 28, 10; Av. x. 3, 6. are often mentioned. The Āraṇyakas of the Rigveda 4) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 2, 4; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xi. 3. Cf. Kauśika Sūtra, xlvi. 9 et seq.; Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa, lxviii. contain a list of dreams with their signification, as well as of pratyakṣa-darśanāni, ‘sights seen with one's own eyes.’

svara|स्वर
स्वर<BR> denotes in the Upaniṣads 1) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, ii. 22, 5; Taittirīya Upaniṣad, i. 2, 1. the sound of a vowel: these are described 2) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, loc. cit. as being ghoṣavant, ‘sonant,’ and also as balavant, ‘uttered with force.’ The precise word for a mute is sparśa, 3) iii. 2, 1, etc. ‘contact,’ while ūṣman denotes a ‘sibilant,’ and svara a ‘vowel,’ in the Aitareya 3) iii. 2, 1, etc. and Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyakas. 4) viii. 1, etc. The semivowels are there denoted by anta-sthā (‘intermediate’) 5) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 2, 1. or akṣara. 6) Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, viii. 1. Another division in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka 7) ii. 2, 4. is into ghoṣa, ūṣman, and vyañjana, apparently ‘vowels,’ ‘sibilants,’ and ‘consonants’ respectively. Ghoṣa elsewhere in that Āraṇyaka 8) ii. 2, 2. Cf. Keith's edition, p. 213. seems to have the general sense of ‘sounds.’ The Taittirīya Upaniṣad 9) Loc. cit. refers to mātrā, a ‘mora’; 10) Also Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 1, 5; Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, vii. 13. bala, ‘force’ of utterance, and varṇa, ‘letter,’ an expression found elsewhere 11) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 32, 2; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxvi. 5; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 4; Weber, Indische Studien, v. 32. in the explanation of om, as compacted of a + u + m. The Aitareya Āraṇyaka 12) iii. 1, 3, 5. and the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 13) vii. 10, 12. recognize the three forms of the Rigveda text as pratṛṇṇa, nirbhuja, and ubhayam-antareṇa, denoting respectively the Saṃhitā, Pada, and Krama Pāṭhas of the Rigveda. 14) Max Müller, Ṛgveda Prātiśākhya, ii. et seq.; Nachträge, ii; Oldenberg, Prolegomena, 380 et seq.; Sacred Books of the East, 30, 146 et seq.; Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 51. The same authorities 15) Aitareya, iii. 2, 6; Śāṅkhāyana, viii. 11. recognize the importance of the distinction of the cerebral and dental n and s, and refer 16) Aitareya, iii. 1, 1; 2, 6; Sāṅkhāyana, vii. 2; viii. 11. to the Māṇḍūkeyas' mode of recitation. They also discuss 17) Aitareya, iii. 1, 2. 3. 5; 2, 2 Śāṅkhāyana, vii. 13; viii. 1, 2. Sandhi, the euphonic ‘combination’ of letters. The Prātiśākhyas of the several Saṃhitās develop in detail the grammatical terminology, and Yāska's Nirukta 18) See Roth's edition (1852), p. 222, for a list of teachers cited by Yāska, especially Kautsa and Śākaṭāyana. contains a good deal of grammatical material. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 19) x. 5, 1, 2. 3. distinguishes the genders, and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 20) x. 9, 1. 2. Cf. von Schroeder, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 701 et seq. the division of words in the Sāman recitation.

svaraaj|स्वराज्
स्व-राज्,<BR> ‘self-ruler,’ ‘king,’ is found frequently in the Rigveda 1) i. 36, 7; 51, 15; 61, 9, etc. (of gods). and later. 2) Av. xvii. 1, 22; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 6, 2; iv. 4, 8, 1; v. 5, 4, 1, etc. It is the technical term for the kings of the west according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 3) viii. 14. Cf. perhaps the republican form of government of which traces are seen in the Buddhist literature by Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 19.

svaru|स्वरु
स्वरु<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 92, 5; 162, 9; iii. 8, 6, etc. or later 2) Av. iv. 24, 4; xii. 1, 13, etc. denotes a ‘post,’ or more precisely in the ritual a splinter of the Yūpa, or sacrificial post. 3) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 8; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 7, 1; vi. 3, 4 9, etc.; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, 1, 22; 8, 1, 5, etc.

svarNara|स्वर्णर
स्वर्-णर<BR> appears to be the proper name of a sacrificer in two verses of the Rigveda. 1) viii. 3, 12; 12, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160; Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 89. According to Geldner, 2) Rigveda, Glossar, 209. it everywhere 3) Rv. iv. 21, 3; v. 18, 4; 14, 1; viii. 6, 39; 65, 2; 103, 14; ix. 70, 6; x. 65, 4. Perhaps in viii. 12, 2, it means ‘coming from Svarṇara.’ means a specially sacred lake and the Soma-producing district around it.

svarbhaanuasura|स्वर्भानुअसुर
स्वर्-भानु असुर<BR> is the name, in the Rigveda 1) v. 40, 5. 6. 8. 9. and later, 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 2, 2; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5, 2; 6, 13; vi. 6, 8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 2, 2; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxiv. 3. of a demon supposed to have eclipsed the sun. See Sūrya.

Geldner, 4) Vedische Studien, 2, 110-115. however, shows that the real sense is the ‘wandering at will’ of cattle, more precisely their ‘grazing in the morning,’ 5) Rv. i. 3, 8; ii. 2, 2; 34, 8; v. 62, 2; viii. 88, 1. and in the case of birds their ‘early flight’ from the nest, 6) Rv. ii. 19, 2; 34, 5. while metaphorically it is applied first to the morning pressing of Soma and then to all three pressings. 7) Rv. i. 34, 7; iii. 60, 6; vi. 68, 10; viii. 99, 1. In Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit., it is equivalent to ‘libation.’

svasR|स्वसृ
स्वसृ<BR> is the regular word from the Rigveda onwards 1) Rv. ii. 32, 6; vi. 55, 4. 5; viii. 101, 15; x. 108, 9, etc. for ‘sister.’ Like the word Bhrātṛ, the term sister can be applied to things not precisely so related. For example, in the Rigveda the fingers and the seasons are ‘sisters,’ and night is the sister of dawn, for whom, as the elder, she makes way. 2) Rv. i. 124, 8. See Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Verwandtschaftsnamen, 463; Rv. i. 62, 10; 64, 7, 71, 1, etc. The Paṇis offer to adopt Saramā as their sister; 3) Rv. x. 108, 9. but this use is not applied--any more than in the case of Bhrātṛ--to ordinary human beings. The sister stood in a close relation to her brother. If the father was dead or feeble, the sister was dependent on her brother and on his wife, as appears from the Rigveda 4) x. 85, 46. Cf. ix. 96, 22. and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. 5) iii. 37, 5. Moreover, maidens without brothers were apt to find marriage difficult, and to degenerate into Hetairai; 6) Av. i. 17, 1; Rv. i. 124, 7; iv. 5, 5; Nirukta, iii. 5. but it is not certain whether this was due, as Zimmer 7) Altindisches Leben, 328. thinks, to brothers being required to arrange marriages for orphan girls, or because sonless fathers were anxious to make their daughters Putrikās, in order that they themselves, instead of the husbands, should count the daughters' sons as their own. 8) Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 22, 48, 49 (on Rv. iii. 31, 1 et seq.). See also Jāmi.

The Sūtras give rules for it in great detail. Cf. Brāhmaṇa.

स्वेद-ज,<BR> ‘born of sweat’--that is, ‘engendered by hot moisture’--is used in the Aitareya Upaniṣad (iii. 3, 3) as a term designating a class of creatures comprising vermin of all sorts. The Mānava Dharma Śāstra (i. 45) explains it as ‘flies, mosquitoes, lice, bugs, and so forth.’ Cf. Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 235.

svaidaayana|स्वैदायन

हारिद्रव<BR> is the name of a yellow bird in the Rigveda, 1) i. 50, 12; viii. 35, 7. perhaps the ‘yellow water-wagtail.’ 2) Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 50, 12; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, 6, 2, treats it as the name of a plant (cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62). But on Av. i. 22, 4, he takes it as gopītanaka, ‘wagtail.’ Geldner 3) Rigveda, Glossar, 213. Cf.

Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 192-195. Cf. Hemanta.

There seems no reasen to deny that in all the passages the word refers vaguely to the mountains now called Himālaya, though it is possible that the name may include mountains not strictly in that system, like the Suleiman hills. 5) Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 198. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leven, 29; Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 12, who inclines to see a reminiscence of the Caucasus. See also Mūjavant and Trikakubh.

hiraNina|हिरणिन
हिरणिन<BR> is found in one passage of the Rigveda, 1) vi. 63, 9. where Ludwig 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158. takes the word as a name of Śāṇḍa. But it seems to be an adjectival form of hiraṇin, ‘golden.’

hiraNya|हिरण्य
हिरण्य<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 43, 5; iii. 34, 9; iv. 10, 6; 17, 11, etc. and later 2) Av. i. 9, 2; ii. 36, 7; v. 28, 6; vi. 38, 2, etc. denotes ‘gold.’ It is hardly possible to exaggerate the value attached to gold by the Vedic Indians. The metal was, it is clear, won from the bed of rivers. Hence the Indus is called ‘golden’ 3) Rv. x. 75, 8. and ‘of golden stream.’ 4) Rv. vi. 61, 7; viii. 26, 18. Apparently the extraction of gold from the earth was known, 5) Rv. i. 117, 5; Av. xii. 1, 6. 26. 44. and washing for gold is also recorded. 6) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 7, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 1, 5.

Gold is always associated with the gods. 10) All that is connected with them is of gold; the horses of the sun are hiraṇya-tvacas, ‘gold-skinned’ (Av. xiii. 2, 8), and so on. In the plural Hiraṇya denotes ‘ornaments of gold.’ 11) Rv. i. 122, 2; 162, 16; ii. 33, 9; v. 60, 4; Av. iv. 10, 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xv. 50; xx. 37; also in the singular, Av. i. 35, 1; xviii. 4, 56.

Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 268, is inclined to think that a gold unit is alluded to in the vague phrases ‘thousands,’ etc., of the Rigveda. See viii. 1, 13; 65, 12; x. 95, 3, etc. In several passages, 14) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 7, 4; iii. 8, 2, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 7, 1, 7; xiii. 4, 1, 6, etc. moreover, hiraṇya or hiraṇyāni may mean ‘pieces of gold.’ Gold is described sometimes as harita, 15) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 4, 4, 6; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ii. 9. ‘yellowish,’ sometimes as rajata, 16) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 5, 1, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 4, 4, 7; xiii. 4, 2, 10, etc. ‘whitish,’ when probably. ‘silver’ is alluded to.

हिरा<BR> in the Atharvaveda 1) i. 17, 1; vii. 35, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxv. 8. Cf. Weber, Omina und Portenta, 346. denotes ‘vein,’ like Hitā.

hRtsvaashayaaallakeya|हृत्स्वाशयआल्लकेय
हृत्स्व्-आशय आल्लकेय<BR> is mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 40, 2) in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) as a pupil of Somaśuṣma Sātyayajñi Prācīnayogya.

hRdayaamaya|हृदयामय
हृदयामय,<BR> ‘disease of the heart,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda in connexion with Yakṣma 1) v. 30, 9. and with Balāsa. 2) vi. 14, 1; 127, 3. Zimmer, 3) Altindisches Leben, 387. who thinks that Balāsa is consumption, connects the name with the later view of the medical Saṃhitās, 4) Wise, Hindu System of Medicine, 321, 322. that love is one of the causes of the disease. But it would be more natural to see in it a disease affecting the heart.

hRdyota|हृद्योत
हृद्-योत<BR> 1) Av. i. 22, 1. Cf. vi. 24, 1. (for Hṛd-dyota) and Hṛd-roga, 2) Rv. i. 50, 11. ‘heart disease,’ are mentioned in the Atharvaveda and the Rigveda respectively. Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 388. identifies the disease in the Atharvaveda with Hṛdayāmaya, ‘consumption caused by love.’ In the Rigveda this is not at all likely: later in the medical Saṃhitās the word probably denotes angina pectoris. 4) Wise, Hindu System of Medicine, 321.

heman|हेमन्
हेमन्<BR> (used only in the locative singular) denotes ‘winter’ in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 1, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvi. 6; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 10, 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 4, 5; xi. 2, 7, 32.

hemanta|हेमन्त
हेमन्त,<BR> ‘winter,’ occurs only once in the Rigveda, 1) x. 161, 4. but often in the later texts. 2) Av. vi. 55, 2; viii. 2, 22; xii. 1, 36; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 7, 2, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 58; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxi. 15, 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 10, 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 4, 5, 2 etc. Zimmer 3) Altindisches Leben, 40. is inclined to trace differences of climate in the Rigveda: he thinks that certain hymns, 4) Rv. vii. 103; x. 90. which ignore winter and insist on the rains, indicate a different place and time of origin from those which refer to the snowy mountains. 5) Rv. x. 68, 10; 121, 4 (both these are not early hymns). It is, however, quite impossible to separate parts of the Rigveda on this basis. It is probable that that text owes its composition in the main to residents in the later Madhyadeśa; hence the references to cold and snow are rather a sign of local than of temporal differences. It is otherwise with the later expansion of the three into four seasons, which represents clearly the earlier advance of the Indians (see Ṛtu). The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 6) i. 5, 4, 5. describes winter as the time when the plants wither, the leaves fall from the trees, the birds fly low and retire more and more.

haitanaamana|हैतनामन
हैत-नामन,<BR> ‘descendant of Hitanāman,’ is the patronymic of a teacher apparently called Āhṛta in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 1) iii. 4, 6. See Pāṇini, vi. 4, 170, Vārttika, and von Schroeder, Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 2, ix. though the verse is a strange one.

hairaNyanaabha|हैरण्यनाभ
हैरण्य-नाभ,<BR> ‘descendant of Hiraṇyanābha,’ is the patronymic of Para Āṭṇāra, the Kosala king, in a Gāthā occurring in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 5, 4, 4).

hotR|होतृ
होतृ<BR> is the name of one of the oldest and most important priests of the Vedic ritual, the counterpart of the Zaotar of the Avestan priesthood. 1) Rv. i. 1, 1; 14, 11; 139, 10, etc.; Hotra, the ‘Hotṛ's office,’ Rv. ii. 1, 2; 36, 1; 37, 1, etc. The word must be derived from hu, ‘sacrifice,’ as was held by Aurṇavābha; 2) Nirukta. iv. 26. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 380 et seq. this indicates a time when the Hotṛ was at once sacrificer (the later Adhvaryu) and singer. But the functions were already clearly divided in the Rigveda, where the Hotṛ's chief duty was the recitation of the Śastras. He was also in the older period often the Purohita of the king, an office later filled by the Brahman priest.

hotraka|होत्रक
होत्रक<BR> in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1) ii. 36, 5; vi. 6, 2. In the Sūtras it is variously used--sometimes in this sense, sometimes more widely--so as to include all the priests except the four chief priests (cf. Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, v. 6, 17). denotes ‘assistant of the Hotṛ’ priest. 

hyas|ह्यस्
ह्यस्<BR> in the Rigveda 1) viii. 66, 7; 99, 1; x. 55, 5. and later 2) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xi. 9, 3. denotes ‘yesterday.’

hrada|ह्रद
ह्रद<BR> in the Rigveda 1) i. 52, 7; iii. 36, 8; 45, 3; x. 43, 7; 71, 7; 102, 4; 142, 8, etc. and later 2) Av. iv. 15, 4; vi. 37, 2; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 10, 18; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 5, 12; 4, 5, 10; xi. 5, 5, 8, etc. denotes a ‘lake’ or ‘pond.’

hradechaxus|ह्रदेचक्षुस्
ह्रदे-चक्षुस्<BR> in one passage of the Rigveda 1) x. 95, 6. is thought by Jackson 2) Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, May, 1890, iv. to mean ‘will of the wisp.’

hrasvamaaNDuukeya|ह्रस्वमाण्डूकेय
ह्रस्व माण्डूकेय<BR> (‘descendant of Maṇḍūka’) is the name of a teacher in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka. 1) iii. 1, 5; 2, 1. 6. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 391. The word must be regarded as a proper name, given from a personal characteristic, much as Sthavira is used.

hraaduni|ह्रादुनि
ह्रादुनि<BR> denotes ‘hail’ in the Rigveda 1) i. 32, 13; v. 54, 3. and later. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 13, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 26; xxvi. 9, etc.

hruuDu|ह्रूडु
ह्रूडु<BR> is a word of unknown meaning applied to Takman in the Atharvaveda. 1) i. 25, 2. 3. It is variously spelled in the manuscript as hruḍa, hūḍu, rūḍu, and so forth; the Paippalāda recension reads huḍu, ‘ram.’ Henry 2) Journal Asiatique, 9th series, 10, 513. has conjectured that the word is the equivalent of a proto-Semitic ḥarāḍu, ‘gold’ (Assyrian huraśu and Hebrew ḥarāś), while Halévy 3) Ibid., 11, 320 et seq. suggests that it may be the Greek  ‘greenish-yellow’; but both conjectures are highly improbable. 4) Macdonell, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1907, 1106. Weber 5) Indische Studien, 4, 420. Cf. Lanman on Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 26; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 273. thinks ‘cramp’ is meant. 

hvaras|ह्वरस्
ह्वरस्<BR> in three passages of the Rigveda 1) ix. 3, 2; 63, 4; 106, 13. denotes, according to Roth, 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 278, n.; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 203. a part of the Soma sieve, perhaps the part through which the Soma juice flowed. But Geldner 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 20 thinks that in all these cases the sense is merely ‘hindrance.’
