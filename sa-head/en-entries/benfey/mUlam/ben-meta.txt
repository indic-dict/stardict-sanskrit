This file describes the coding conventions of the data files.
This file is encoded in utf-8 encoding.

The original digitization is file ben_orig.txt, which is
coded in the cp1252 (windows 1252) encoding,
and is best viewed in a text editor which supports this encoding.
For example, in Emacs, one may use the command
revert-buffer-with-coding-system
and then select cp1252 as the coding.
The internet reference http://www.cp1252.com/ describes this coding system.

The file ben_orig_utf8.txt is a conversion of ben_orig.txt to the
more common utf-8 encoding.
(Nov 8, 2014) The file ben_orig_utf8_slp1.txt contains the same data, but
  has Devanagari coded in SLP1 transliteration.  It is the basis of further
  corrections.

The file ben.txt is also in the utf-8 encoding, and incorporates various
editing changes, such as corrections of typographical errors.

There are several extended ascii codes occurring in ben.txt:

¤  (\u00a4)   237 := CURRENCY SIGN: indicates a 'long-short' vowel
¦  (\u00a6) 17324 := BROKEN BAR
º  (\u00ba)   511 := MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR
Æ  (\u00c6)     9 := LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE
Ç  (\u00c7)  2532 := LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA
æ  (\u00e6)    50 := LATIN SMALL LETTER AE
ç  (\u00e7)  7431 := LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA
œ  (\u0153)    28 := LATIN SMALL LIGATURE OE
‘  (\u2018)   169 := LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
’  (\u2019)   172 := RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
„  (\u201e)     2 := DOUBLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK
†  (\u2020)  1386 := DAGGER

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{# #}  22319  : {#X#}  Sanskrit coded in HK. 
                Nov 8, 2014: X is now in SLP1 transliteration in ben.txt
{% %}  57590  : italic text. Usually (always?) Sanskrit coded in AS.
{@ @}  41385  : bold text. Usually (always?) Sanskrit coded in AS.
{??}     232  : unreadable text.
                Sep 30, 2014. Sampada Savardekar corrected all of these.
{| |?      2  : only once - wide spacing in text

The following  <x> type tags are found in ben.txt:

<g></g>  1513  : Greek text
<>      76322  : Begining of 'normal' lines
<H>        46  : Section header. 
<HI>      593  : Appear only in the Additions and Corrections Section
<NI>        1  : Appears in Preface
<P>     17455  : Part of Headword coding.

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded, in the body of the dictionary, as:
Coded in body of dictionary as:
[Pagepppp-c+ nn] where
pppp is the page number (0 filled) from 0001 to 1127.
c is the column: 'a' or 'b'
nn is the number of (following) lines in the page-column.
First is 0001-a, last is 1127-b
 
The lines of the digitization correspond to the lines of the text.

Headword coding is generally exemplified by: 
<P>{#a'#}¦ {%a-,%}
Some other much less frequently occurring forms are:
<P>1. {#Uh#}¦ {%U10H,%}
<P>† 1. {#kal#}¦ {%KAL,%}
<P>{@I.@} {#kun~c#}¦ {%KUN4CH,%}
<P>{#aGgurIyaka#}¦ {%an3guri10yaka = an3guli10-
<P>{#aTani#}¦ and {#aTanI#} {%at2ani¤10,%} 

The most common headword form may be abstracted as:
<P>{#X#}¦ {%Y%}  where X is in Harvard-Kyoto coding and Y is in 
                 Anglicized Sanskrit coding.

Here is the regular expression used in python programs to recognize headwords;
it is in headword.py.
The most common form (identifying key1,key2) is 
 r'^<P>.*?{#(.*?)#}¦ *{%(.*?)%}'
 
This covers all but about 350 of the headwords, and specifies key1 and key2.
However, for completeness, we use the form
reHeadword = r'^<P>.*?{#(.*?)#}¦' which only identifies key1.
In make_xml, an attempt is made to recognize some of the other forms.

Note that the part between <P> and {#, while usually absent (except in 431
cases) is uninterpreted by the current programs. It often contains a 'homonym'
number.

The headwords are ordered according to Sanskrit alphabet ordering.


Most Sanskrit in the text appears in the European Indological form, which is
coded in ben.txt with the the AS (Anglicized Sanskrit) coding.
The general AS scheme, as described in CDSL.pdf, uses Latin alphabetical
letters 'x (a-z,A-Z), possibly with suffixed numbers; the letter-number
combinations are, in the general scheme:
x1 = macron
x2 = dot below
x3 = dot above
x4 = accent aigu
x5 = tilde
x6 = dash below
x7 = umlaut
x10 = circonflex (hat)
x11 = accent grave

Here are the characters that occur in ben.txt in this coding,
with their approximate frequency.  

Note that the palatal sibilants are coded using the c-cedilla: Ç, ç,
rather than with an Anglicized Sanskrit code.

Notes:

1. Those marked 'NO DESCRIPTION' may be instances of miscoding; they have
  not been further examined.
2. The m5, M5 codes correspond to unicode sequences using a COMBINING TILDE;
  in web page displays, the quality of these displays is sometimes poor.
3. The vowels with accents (like a4) could represent either Sanskrit accents
  (udatta for a4) or acute accents of European languages.
4. Sanskrit long vowels are represented in this dictionary with the 
  circumflex, such as ra10ma (râma).
