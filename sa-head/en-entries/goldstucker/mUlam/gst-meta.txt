This file describes the coding conventions of the data files.
This file is encoded in utf-8 encoding.

The original digitization is file gst_orig.txt, which is
coded in the cp1252 (windows 1252) encoding,
and is best viewed in a text editor which supports this encoding.
For example, in Emacs, one may use the command
revert-buffer-with-coding-system
and then select cp1252 as the coding.
The internet reference http://www.cp1252.com/ describes this coding system.

The file gst_orig_utf8.txt is a conversion of gst_orig.txt to the
more common utf-8 encoding.
The file gst_orig_utf8_slp1.txt is a conversin of gst_orig_utf8.txt in which
Harvard-Kyoto transliteration of Sanskrit is changed to SLP1 transliteration.

The file gst.txt is also in the utf-8 encoding, and incorporates various
editing changes, such as corrections of typographical errors.

There are several extended ascii codes occurring in gst.txt:

£  (\u00a3)     3 := POUND SIGN
¤  (\u00a4)     1 := CURRENCY SIGN
¦  (\u00a6)  6771 := BROKEN BAR
º  (\u00ba)   206 := MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR
Æ  (\u00c6)     6 := LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE
æ  (\u00e6)    54 := LATIN SMALL LETTER AE
ç  (\u00e7)     1 := LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA
œ  (\u0153)    19 := LATIN SMALL LIGATURE OE
‘  (\u2018)  1613 := LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
’  (\u2019)  1569 := RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
“  (\u201c)    13 := LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
”  (\u201d)    13 := RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
…  (\u2026)   387 := HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS



The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}  44859  : {#X#} devanagari text, coded with HK
                Nov 4, 2014:  Now, X is coded with SLP1 
{@X@}      5  : bold text: only in non-body pages
{%X%}   6506  : italic text 
{|X|}     63  : widely spaced text
{??}      21  : unreadable text

The following  <x> type tags are found:
<g></g>  16  : Greek text, not transcoded
<>    28229  : Line beginning
<H>       9  : Heading. In title sections
<HI>   6811  : Part of headword notation
<HS>      2  : In  title section(s)
<P>    1156  : 'Paragraph' beginning new Sense

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded as
[Page001-a+ 41] occurring on line 13 of gst.txt
In general, a page number has form [Pagexxx-y+ nn] where x is page number and
y is column (a or b) and nn is the number of lines in the following column.

Other forms appear at beginning of non-body text (title, preface, corrections)

The lines of the digitization correspond to lines of the text.

Headword coding is exemplified by: <HI>{#a#}¦
The general form is <HI>{#X#}¦
where X (key1) is coded in Harvard-Kyoto transliteration.
A variant form is used when there are homonymns, as exemplified by:
<HI>I. {#apa#}¦  homonym  (also II,III)
The headwords are ordered according to Sanskrit alphabet ordering.

Only words beginning with the first Sanskrit letter, 'a', appear in this
dictionary.

Sanskrit in the text sometimes appears in the European Indological form, which is
coded in gst.txt with the the AS (Anglicized Sanskrit) coding.
The general AS scheme, as described in CDSL.pdf, uses Latin alphabetical
letters 'x (a-z,A-Z), possibly with suffixed numbers; the letter-number
combinations are, in the general scheme:
x1 = macron
x2 = dot below
x3 = dot above
x4 = accent aigu
x5 = tilde
x6 = dash below
x7 = umlaut
x10 = circonflex (hat)
x11 = accent grave

Here are the characters that occur in gst.txt in this coding,
with their approximate frequency.  
Some consonants, like d, appear in the text with an acute accent.
In these cases there is no preformed unicode equivalent, and such a character
C is represented in displays with as C\u0301  COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT
The visual display of these combining characters varies in quality, and
is often either invisible or awkwardly placed.
