E. 116).^46<BR>Ghaṭotkaca was the name of a son of Bhīma-sena by the<BR>Rākṣasī Hiḍimbā.^47 Names based on Ghaṭa are very rare in<BR>Sanskrit literature. Thus Gaṇeśa is named Ghaṭodara ‘pot-<BR>bellied’.^48 The name Ghaṭotkaca refers to the practice of<BR>bearing traditional names based on Epics and Purāṇas. Deriva-<BR>tively it means a person having a hairless head.^49 In Prācīna<BR>Caritrakośa it has been suggested that Ghaṭotkaca was so<BR>called as his head was like a ghaṭa (pitcher) and was hairless.^50<BR>Tripathi suggests on the basis of the Skanda Purāṇa that<BR>Ghaṭotkaca was so called as he produced a loud voice while<BR>laughing which may be compared to the voice produced by<BR>thumping the pitcher quite aloud at its mouth by hands.^51 But<BR>the first derivation seems to be more plausible from linguistic<BR>point of view^52 while the other explanation may be more<BR>important from socio-psychological or mythological point of<BR>view.<BR>It is possible that it was the nickname of Ghaṭotkaca which<BR>might have become his famous name.<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=020&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=2" target="_blank">Correction</a>

3. Candragupta I: (No. 47, L. 2; No. 53, L. 2; No. 40, L. 3;<BR>No. 21, L. 5; No. 1, L. 28; No. 30, L. 1):<BR>While his two predecessors are each given the title of<BR>Mahārāja, Candragupta I is described in the inscriptions as<BR>Mahārājādhirāja, ‘king of kings’. Mookerjee connects the passage<BR>from the Purāṇas defining the extent of the Gupta territory<BR>with the period before Samudragupta, i.e., under Candragupta<BR>I.^53 It has been suggested that Caṇḍasena of the play ‘Kaumudī-<BR>Mahotsava’ is to be identified with Candragupta I. The<BR>Licchavi alliance is the common point in the account given by<BR>the drama and the inscriptions.^54 Other details of the drama,<BR>however, do not support this identification. The drama<BR>condemns Caṇḍasena as an usurper and belonging to low caste<BR>whom the citizens of Magadha could not tolerate and drove out<BR>to die in exile. Linguistically also Caṇḍasena and Candragupta<BR>are different names. Candra can become Caṇḍa in Prakrit but<BR>Gupta cannot be transformed into Sena. Moreover, in the fifth<BR>act of the play we are informed through a character Lokākṣī<BR>that the cursed Caṇḍasena has been killed and his royal family<BR>uprooted.^55 Thus we know about the total annihilation of the<BR>dynasty after the death of Caṇḍasena which is not applicable<BR>to the dynasty of Caṇḍragupta which ruled for several genera-<BR>tions after him.^56 The name of the deity Candra ‘moon’ has<BR>been given to this king; Gupta is the surname. It may refer<BR>to his handsome physical features.<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=021&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=3" target="_blank">Correction</a>

He<BR>was the daughter's son of the Licchavis, and son of Mahārājā-<BR>dhirāja Śrī Candragupta I born on the queen Kumāradevī.^58<BR>He has been mentioned as a ‘Paramabhāgavata’ (a devout<BR>devotee of Lord Viṣṇu).^59 No. 2, L. 10 gives the justification<BR>of his name Samudragupta.^60 Mookerji says that the name<BR>Samudragupta was probably a title assumed after his conquests.<BR>It means ‘protected by the sea’ and may refer to his dominion<BR>which extended upto the sea. The Mathurā Inscription of<BR>Candragupta II actually describes the fame of his conquests as<BR>extending up to the four oceans (caturudadhisalilāsvāditaya-<BR>śasaḥ). The name Samudragupta may be split up into two parts,<BR>Samudra being his personal name, and Gupta being his<BR>surname. This is supported by the fact that the obverse of his<BR>coins of standard type sometimes bears the legend ‘Samudra’<BR>while the reverse has ‘Parākramaḥ’ as his title. The name<BR>‘Samudra’ also appears on some other types of his coins, such<BR>as the Archer type and Battle-Axe type.^61 Mookerji^62 holds that<BR>Samudragupta's personal name was Kāca and that Samudra-<BR>gupta was his title. But the identification of Kāca with<BR>Samudragupta has been rightly opposed by scholars.^63 Vāmana<BR>in his Kāvyalaṃkāra^64 refers to Candraprakāśa as the son of<BR>Candragupta which Goyal takes to be another name of<BR>Samudragupta.^65 But it seems to be the name of a local king of<BR>Ayodhyā rather than that of a member of the Imperial Gupta<BR>dynasty.^66 Another probable and most suitable explanation<BR>of the name ‘Samudragupta’ may be ‘protected by Lord Śiva’,<BR>Samudra being an epithet of Śiva.^67<BR>Samudragupta is given many epithets in No. 1. Some of<BR>these are also supported by numismatic evidence.^68<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=021&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=4" target="_blank">Correction</a>

6. Govindagupta: (No. 42, L. 2; No. 32, L. 3):<BR>In No. 42, he is mentioned as the son of Candragupta II. His<BR>mother's name was Dhruvasvāminī. No. 32 explains the basis<BR>of his name: “The lord of the earth, i.e. king Candragupta,<BR>produced a son whose exalted name was Govindagupta, who<BR>was as famous as Govinda (Viṣṇu) for the glory of his virtues,<BR>and who resembled the sons of Diti and Aditi, i.e. the demons<BR>and gods.”^77 The poet means that Govindagupta resembled<BR>demons in physical strength and valour, and gods in spiritual<BR>virtues.<BR>Govindagupta probably ruled as emperor between (his<BR>father) Candragupta II and (his younger brother) Kumāra-<BR>gupta 1. His reign could not have been more than three years,<BR>the interval between the last known date of Candragupta II<BR>(G. E. 93) and the earliest known date of Kumāragupta I (G.E.<BR>96).^78 P. L. Gupta assigns his short regnal period between<BR>A.D. 412 and 415.^79 That Govindagupta could have ruled as<BR>emperor only for a very short period is also evident from the<BR>fact that he has left no coins. Being a collateral, Govindagupta<BR>does not appear in the genealogical table in the inscriptions of<BR>Kumāragupta and his successors.^80<BR>It is also likely that Kumāragupta defeated or ousted<BR>Govindagupta and seized the throne; and after his accession,<BR>avoided all references to his elder brother.^81<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=023&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=6" target="_blank">Correction</a>

Pūrugupta (No. 47, L. 6; No. 53, L. 6; No. 49, L. 6;<BR>No. 50, L. 6; No. 38, L. 1):<BR>We know from No. 53 that Mahārājādhirāja Śrī Pūrugupta<BR>was the son of Mahārājādhirāja Śrī Kumāragupta by his chief<BR>queen Anantadevī. In No. 38, L. 1 the name of the father<BR>and predecessor of Narasiṃhagupta is spelt as Pūrugupta.^89<BR>The reading Pūrugupta is unmistakeable on the fragmentary<BR>Nālandā Seal of Narasiṃhagupta and is also fairly clear<BR>on the seals of Kumāragupta II. The medial ū sign in<BR>the first letter of the name Pūrugupta is indicated by an<BR>additional stroke attached to the base of the letter and the<BR>downward elongation of its right limb; mere elongation of the<BR>right limb by itself would have denoted the short medial u as<BR>in puttras in LL. 2 and 3. In the second letter of the name,<BR>viz. ru. the medial u is shown by a small hook turned to left<BR>and joined to the foot of r. Palaeographical considerations<BR>apart, the name Purugupta yields a more plausible-sense than<BR>Puragupta and fits better in the series of the grand and digni-<BR>fied names of the Gupta kings. The first part of the Gupta<BR>names constituted the real or substantive name and yielded<BR>satisfactory meaning independently of the latter half, viz.<BR>gupta, which being family surname was a mere adjunct. Pura,<BR>by itself is neither a complete nor a dignified name while Puru<BR>is both. Pūru or its variant Puru may, like Vainya in Vainya-<BR>gupta signify the homonymous epic hero of the lunar race<BR>who was the ancestor of the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas, or<BR>may mean abundant or great.^90<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=024&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=9" target="_blank">Correction</a>

Accord-<BR>ing to Sircar there is no space for the name of any other<BR>Gupta prince between Pūrugupta and Bhudhagupta and their<BR>relationship is clearly mentioned by the word ‘putra’ occurring<BR>at the end of line 6.^97 In other words pūrugupta was the<BR>father of Budhagupta.<BR>In his description of Nālandā, Hiuen Tsang says that the<BR>monastic establishments at that place were enriched by the<BR>successive endowments of Śakrāditya, Budhagupta, Tathāgata-<BR>gupta and Bālāditya.^98 On the strength of this statement it has<BR>been suggested that Budhagupta was the son of Kumāragupta I<BR>who had the title of Mahendrāditya (Mahendra = Śakra).^99<BR>In view of the clear epigraphic reference to the parentage of<BR>Budhagupta the proposed identification must be rejected.^100<BR>The statement of Hiuen Tsang was based on hearsay and not<BR>on sound history, or else his Budhagupta is not to be identified<BR>with Budhagupta of the Imperial Gupta line.<BR>The name Budhagupta is based on Mercury.

वैन्यगुप्त
2. Vainyagupta: (No. 51, L. 5; No. 52, L. 1):<BR>Vainya is the synonym for the first king ‘Pṛthu’.^109 Hiranand<BR>Shastri mentions Vainya as a synonym of Kubera, the god of<BR>wealth. According to Sir Richard Burn Vainya was another<BR>name of Vajra whom Hiuen Tsang mentions as the son of<BR>Bālāditya. He chiefly relies on the St. Petersburg dictionary<BR>where Vainya is derived from Vena and is connected with<BR>Indra; Vajra is the thunderbolt and Vainya is a patronymic<BR>from Vena who is Indra.^110 But the suggested identification is<BR>extremely far-fetched. Vajra cannot by any stretch of imagina-<BR>tion be described as a synonym of Vainya. Moreover, it is diffi-<BR>cult to believe that Hiuen Tsang would have referred to the<BR>king by such a name in preference of the real name.<BR>In No. 51 Vainyagupta is mentioned as a paramabhāgavata<BR>and mahārājādhirāja, but in No. 53 he is described as a devotee<BR>of Lord Śiva (bhagavān mahādevapādānudhyāta) and a mahārāja<BR>only. Some scholars hold the opinion that it shall be wrong to<BR>disconnect Vainyagupta from the Gupta family on the basis of<BR>the argument that the Guptas were Vaiṣṇavas while Vainya-<BR>gupta professed to be a Śaiva.^111 We find both the epithets<BR>‘paramabhāgavata’ and ‘mahādevapādānudhyāta’ for him in our<BR>records.<BR>It is interesting that even his Pādadāsa and Uparika are<BR>styled as mahārājas (LL. 3 and 16). His title Mahārāja, there-<BR>fore, cannot prove that Vainyagupta was an insignificant<BR>prince.^112<BR>The legend on No. 51, though partially preserved, resembles<BR>in point of style the legend on the other seals of the Imperial<BR>Guptas. Here Vainyagupta is specifically called paramabhāgavata.<BR>Moreover, his name, like those of other kings in the Gupta<BR>dynasty ends in the word Gupta. It is thus clear that Vainya-<BR>gupta belonged to the line of the Imperial Guptas. He seems<BR>to have ruled in any case over considerable parts of Bengal and<BR>Bihar^113 almost immediately after Budhagupta. We do not<BR>know anything about the relationship of Vainyagupta with<BR>Budhagupta and Bhānugupta of the Eraṇ Inscription of A.D.<BR>510.^114 Some scholars assign him a reign of four years before<BR>Bhānugupta (A.D. 510).^115<BR>The regnal period of Vainyagupta witnessed a considerable<BR>decline in the power and prestige of the Imperial Guptas. The<BR>rise of the ruling dynasty consisting of Dharmāditya, Gopa-<BR>candra and Samācāradeva in Central and South-West Bengal<BR>in the first half of the sixth Century A.D., possibly points to<BR>the extirpation of Gupta rule from Bengal excepting the<BR>bhukti (province) of Puṇḍravardhana (North Bengal).^116<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=027&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=16" target="_blank">Correction</a>

भानुगुप्त
3. Bhānugupta (No. 19, L. 5):<BR>He is known only from No. 19. His no other coin or seal has<BR>yet come to light. As regards the position of Bhānugupta, seve-<BR>ral alternatives are possible. First, he may have been a succes-<BR>sor of Vainyagupta and the dominions of both may have<BR>included parts of Eastern Malwa. Second, Vainyagupta may have<BR>been the lord of the eastern part of the Gupta Empire when its<BR>western part was being ruled by Bhānugupta. Third, Bhānu-<BR>gupta may have been a viceroy in the Malwa region like<BR>Govindagupta and Ghaṭotkacagupta. It is possible that he be-<BR>longed to the Imperial Gupta line but whether he succeeded<BR>Vainygupta, or the two ruled at the same time respectively<BR>over the western and eastern parts of the empire, is difficult to<BR>determine. The latter view seems more probable and this in-<BR>ternal dissension perhaps paved the way for the downfall of the<BR>empire.^117 Bhānugupta, in spite of the high encomiums paid to<BR>his bravery in Eraṇ Inscription, remains a shadowy figure, and<BR>we do not know what was his position in the Gupta Imperial<BR>family, or what part he played in the dark days of the Gupta<BR>empire.^118<BR>His name is based on the god Sun ‘Bhānu’.<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=029&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=17" target="_blank">Correction</a>

There is also a possibility that the Sanskrit<BR>word ‘mantra’ meaning ‘a hymn or magical formula’ got<BR>changed to ‘maṇṭa’ through a process of Prakritization, or<BR>we may derive it from an artificial root ‘maṇṭ’ to act as<BR>intermediator.^36<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=043&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=48" target="_blank">Correction</a>

दुडिक
4. Duḍika (No. 16, L. 5):<BR>He was a brāhmaṇa belonging to the community of Caturvedins<BR>of the locality known as Padmā in the city of Indrapura. He<BR>has been mentioned as the great grand-father of the brāh-<BR>maṇa Devaviṣṇu, the giver of an endowment for the maintenance<BR>of a lamp in the temple of the god Sun.<BR>It is an abbreviated name with the ending “ika”^12 like<BR>Devika for Devadatta; Yajñika for Yajñadatta and Chadika<BR>for Chandodatta.^13<BR>The name ‘Ḍaḍḍa’, ‘Ḍuḍḍa’ or ‘Ḍuḍḍā’^14 cannot be<BR>derived from any Sanskrit root. Nor are these names found<BR>in any Sanskrit or Prakrit dictionary. Dr. H.D. Sankalia<BR>suggests that these names were derived from the Sanskrit<BR>term Dardara,^15 meaning ‘a mountain’, or a region having<BR>holes or ravines. The man may have shifted from a hilly<BR>region.<BR>We find references to geographical names like ‘Daddara-<BR>pabbata’ and ‘Mahādaddara’ in the Daddara Jātaka.^16 The<BR>Daddarapabbata may be identified with the mountainous tract<BR>of Dardistan, lying to the north-west of Kashmir, and south<BR>of Little Pamir. Since the river Sindhu after its origin in the<BR>Himalayas near Tibet flows through this country, Pāṇini calls<BR>the river Dāradī Sindhuḥ.^17<BR>The people of this tract, the Daradas are mentioned in the<BR>Mahābhārata in the list of the foreign tribes which sprang up<BR>along with the Yavanas, Mlecchas and Śakas, from the cow<BR>Kāmadhenu, when she was being forcibly driven away by<BR>Viśvāmitra from Vasiṣṭha's āśrama.^18 The Daradas are the<BR>people, living above Peshawar.^19 But the basic weakness in the<BR>suggestion made by Dr. H.D. Sankalia^20 is, as he himself<BR>admits, these names are not found in any Sanskrit or Prakrit<BR>dictionary.<BR>It may be noted that the words Ḍoḍa and Ḍoḍḍa are syno-<BR>nyms used for a brāhmaṇa and Ḍoḍiṇī stands for a brāhmaṇī,<BR>or a brāhmaṇa-woman.^21 These are deśya words and hence<BR>refer to local elements.<BR>In Punjabi language a person who is very simple or credu-<BR>lous or who can be very easily cheated is called ‘Ḍoḍa’. It is<BR>not unlikely that on account of his pious ways and bookish<BR>approach a brāhmaṇa was generally taken to be a simple<BR>person. In the Sanskrit story books the picture of a typical<BR>brāhmaṇa is that of a simpleton who can be easily duped.<BR>Hence it is possible that a brāhmaṇa was called ‘Ḍoḍa’ and<BR>the feminine form of ‘Ḍoḍa’ (i. e. Ḍoḍiṇī) was used for a<BR>brāhmaṇa-womaṇ.^22<BR>In Karnataka ‘Ḍoḍḍu’ means ‘big’ or elder. ‘Ḍoḍḍācārya’<BR>or ‘Ḍuḍḍācārya’ a term of respect for a learned Paṇḍita is also<BR>used in satire.<BR>It is interesting to note that Ḍaḍḍa is also an English slang<BR>word meaning ‘a foolish person’.<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=089&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=273" target="_blank">Correction</a>

Bhaṭṭa or Bhaṭṭi, a surname<BR>meaning ‘a teacher’ has been put here before Bhava. Bhaṭṭi is<BR>the Prakritised form of Sanskrit ‘Bharti’ meaning a lord or<BR>master which came to be accepted as a Sanskrit word. ‘Bhava’<BR>means ‘a god, deity’ and is also the name of Lord Śiva.<BR>Bhava also means ‘prosperity, welfare’.^30 Thus the full name<BR>literally means ‘one who is a (source of) prosperity, for his<BR>teacher’.

1. Ābhīra (No. 1, L. 22):<BR>They were one of the tribes subdued by Samudragupta.<BR>Ābhīras lived to the north of the Rajaputana desert. We may<BR>also think of Abiravan between Herat and Kandahar which<BR>may have been the original home of the Ābhīras. In the 3rd<BR>century A.D. there was an Ābhīra kingdom in the north-<BR>western Deccan.^21 D.C. Sircar^22 describes Ābhīra in singular as<BR>a member of the Cowherd Community. The tribe can still be<BR>traced in the present Ahīras,^23 who in tribal groups, abound<BR>largely in the Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Nepal and some portions<BR>of Rajasthan. They are a band of simple, sturdy people,<BR>mostly cowherds and agriculturists.^24 This tribe^25 is thought to<BR>have played a big part in the propagation of the worship of<BR>Kṛṣṇa Govinda^26 in his pastoral aspect.<BR>The Mahābhārata^27 places the Ābhīras in West Rajasthan<BR>‘where the Sarasvatī disappears’.<BR>In the first and second centuries A.D. they are located in<BR>the country between the lower Sindhu valley and Kathiawar,<BR>as is indicated in the ‘Periplus’ and in the Geography of<BR>Ptolemy.^28 The Periplus calls their country Abiria. Ābhīra<BR>generals served in the armies of Śaka Kṣatraps of Western<BR>India in the second century A.D. as is known from their<BR>inscriptions.^29 They are also mentioned in the Mahābhāṣya<BR>of Patañjali^30 in association with the Śūdras, the Sodrai of<BR>Alexander's time, who lived in northern Sind. Throughout<BR>the third century A.D. the Ābhīras exercised ruling power in<BR>northern Konkan and Mahārāshtra.^31 Vātsyāyana^32 refers to<BR>the Harem of the Ābhīra kings. The Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa^33<BR>and the Vāyu Purāṇa^34 refer to them as ‘Dakṣiṇāpatha-vāsinaḥ’<BR>or dwelling in the Southern Country. The Bṛhat-saṃhitā^35<BR>mentions them as being under the jurisdiction of Śani<BR>(Saturn).<BR>The Jodhpur Inscription of Saṃvat 918, records that the<BR>Ābhīra people of this area were a terror to their neighbours,<BR>because of their violent demeanour.^36 The Ābhīra robbers are<BR>also mentioned in the Skanda Purāṇa.^37 Epigraphic evidence<BR>indicates the existence of an Ābhīra kingdom in the 14th<BR>Century in Khandesh.^38<BR>In the Sāhitya Darpaṇa of Viśvanātha,^39 it is stated that<BR>Ābhīrī is the language of the Ābhīras and Cāṇḍālī of the<BR>Caṇḍālas. Those who do woodwork can speak Ābhīrī or Śābarī,<BR>either of the two. Daṇḍin asserts that the speeches of the<BR>Ābhīras, etc., are termed as Apabhraṃśa in the Kāvya^40 on<BR>the basis of which probably Keith writes: “the Prakrit lyrics<BR>passed into Apabhraṃśa as a result of the activities of the<BR>Ābhīras and the Gurjaras.^41 We know from the Amarakośa^42<BR>that ‘Ābhīrī’ was used to denote ‘Ābhīra woman or the wife of<BR>a cowherd’.<BR>The Amarakośa^43 mentions Gopa, Gopāla, Gosaṃkhya,<BR>Godhuk and Ballava as the synonyms for Ābhīra and says that<BR>the village or place where Ābhīras lived is named as Ghoṣa or<BR>Ābhīrapallī.^44<BR>In the Kashmirian recension of the Mahābhārata we get<BR>the readings ‘Kābhīra’ and ‘Kabhīra’ in place of Ābhīra.^45<BR>These Kashmirian forms may have resulted from an attempt<BR>to record an initial glottal opening in the language of the<BR>Ābhīras. The Kasmiras probably knew the Ābhīras at an early<BR>date.^46<BR>Bhattacharya^47 describes the Ābhīrs or Ahīrs as a cowherd<BR>caste exceeding 8,000,000, and found almost everywhere in<BR>India north of the Narmadā. The Ābhīras are mentioned as<BR>foreigners in the Purāṇas.^48 Their kings were regarded as<BR>vrātya and mostly śūdras (black).^49 In the Mahābhārata the<BR>Ābhīras are called Mleccha.^50 According to Manu^51 they were<BR>the sons of a brāhmaṇa man and an ambaṣṭha woman, the<BR>Ambaṣṭhas being of mixed origin and known as the Ānava<BR>kṣatriyas.^52 The Bṛhatsaṃhitā^53 places the Ābhīras in the<BR>Southern quarter of India.<BR>Shafer^54 considers them to be an admixture possibly of<BR>white Iranian blood with enough Bhil blood to give them a<BR>a very dark colour and concludes that they were western<BR>Ānavas.^55<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=125&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=314" target="_blank">Correction</a>

2. Ārjunāyanas (No. 1, L. 22):<BR>One of the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta.<BR>The name Ārjuneya is mentioned in the Ṛgveda as the<BR>patronymic of Kautsa.^56 The tribe, associated with the name<BR>of Arjuna, existed in the Punjab and the North-West up to<BR>the advent of Gupta power in the fourth century A.D.^57 The<BR>word Arjuna in the Vedic literature^58 denotes ‘white’ and<BR>‘white lepresy’ and is also an epithet of Indra. But it does not<BR>denote a tribe or a human hero.<BR>The word Arjuna has an unmistakable resemblance with<BR>the Śaka word erzuna, meaning a ‘leader’ or ‘chief’ which is<BR>derived from arzi. Analogous to it are the Śaka words aljsā,<BR>meaning ‘silvery’ and āljsata, meaning ‘silver’, that are akin to<BR>the Avestan word erezata (silver), the Sanskrit word rajata<BR>(silver) and the Persian word arziz (tin).^59 All these words have<BR>the original sense of whiteness and brightness, that are also<BR>connoted by the word arjuna in Sanskrit. It is highly significant<BR>that Arjuna, the hero of the Mahābhārata, is said to have borne<BR>this name, because he was ‘white’ and ‘pure’ in action.^60 All<BR>over the Eurasian steppes the nobles were regarded as ‘white’<BR>and the commoners were considered ‘black’. Hence the word<BR>for white colour was employed to denote the idea of leadership.<BR>This is why erzuna was used in the sense of a ‘leader’ in Śaka<BR>languages.^61<BR>Vedic and Śaka both branched from the same parent Indo-<BR>European language. Hence many words were common to both.<BR>But whereas arjuna in Vedic lost its pristine sense and was<BR>only used as an adjective, signifying ‘whiteness’, in Śaka it<BR>meant a ‘tribe’ and a human hero and later on this sense was<BR>imparted to this word in India as a result of the impact of the<BR>Śakas.^62<BR>The tribe, bearing the name of Arjuna, was also connected<BR>with some people of Chinese Turkestan, whose heroes, and<BR>kings had this designation.^63 In the Uighur redaction of the<BR>Hiḍimbāvadha^64 the name of Arjuna occurs in the form of<BR>Arcuni.^65 According to Sylvain Levi, this episode of the Mahā-<BR>bhārata owed the privilege of entering into the Turkish world<BR>to the presence of the name of Arjuna in it, who was regarded<BR>as the eponymous founder of the dynasties of some Central<BR>Asiatic oases-states.^66<BR>Pāṇini^67 refers to the worshipper of Arjuna, called Arjunaka,<BR>together with the devotee of Vasudeva, called Vāsudevaka.<BR>This remark implies that Arjuna was treated as a deity at the<BR>time of Pāṇini and his followers occupied a prominent posi-<BR>tion. ^68 The Kāśikā replaces Auddālakāyana of Patañjali by<BR>Ārjunāyana,^69 the name of a tribe nearer to its own time in<BR>discussing the meaning of Prācya-bhārata (II. 4. 66).<BR>From the accounts relating to the invasion of India by<BR>Alexander we learn that a tribe named Agalassoi (Arjunāyana)<BR>fought with Alexander.^70<BR>The Bṛhat-saṃhitā^71 places the Ārjunāyana in the northern<BR>division of India and describes them as being in the region of<BR>Bṛhaspati.^72<BR>Ptolemy refers to a people in the Punjab whom he calls<BR>Pandoouoi^73 = Pāṇḍavas with whom the Ārjunāyanas may be<BR>connected.^74 Ārjunāyana coins are found in the Mathurā<BR>region and ‘they may be assigned with probability to the region<BR>lying west of Agra and Mathura, equivalent, roughly speaking,<BR>to the Bharatpur and Alwar States’.^75<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=127&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=315" target="_blank">Correction</a>

Āṭavī as<BR>a city of the Deccan is mentioned in the Mahābhārata.^80 The<BR>Āṭavyas were certainly the same as the Āṭavikas of the<BR>Allahabad Pillar Inscription and were perhaps aboriginal<BR>tribes dwelling in the jungle tracts of Central India.^81 We find<BR>a reference to the Āṭavikas or the forest savages in the<BR>Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya and it was an Arthaśāstra practice<BR>to hire the Āṭavikas as scouts and army auxiliaries,^82 which<BR>needs must influence their future advance to civilization.<BR>Āṭavika-rāja should be translated as ‘forest-kings’ or ‘kings of<BR>forest countries’. We get a reference to Jāṅgalas in the Puranic<BR>List of Peoples.^83 Similar terms ‘vana-rāṣṭra’ ‘forest-countries’<BR>and vana-rājya ‘forest-kingdoms’ also occur in the Bṛhat-<BR>Saṃhitā.^84 But these countries lay in the north-east division<BR>of India, as mapped out by Varāhamihira, and they are, at<BR>any rate, not the countries referred here.^85<BR>In the Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata, in one line of<BR>Sahadeva's digvijaya, Professor Franklin Edgerton changes<BR>Āṭavī to Antākhi, so that the line will refer to Antioch, Rome<BR>and the Greeks.

दैवपुत्र
4. Daivaputra^87 (No. 1, L. 23):<BR>Daivaputras along with Ṣāhis, Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas and<BR>Muruṇḍas are mentioned to have paid homage to Samudra-<BR>gupta by rendering to him all kinds of service.<BR>The word ‘Daivaputra’ denotes those ‘who belong to<BR>devaputra’, i. e., Kaniṣka, i. e., the Kuṣāṇa ruler. The title<BR>devaputra has frequently been used as a title by the Kuṣāṇa<BR>kings.^88<BR>The common belief is that the designation devaputra ‘god-<BR>son’ was copied by the Kuṣāṇas from the ancient Chinese<BR>imperial title, ‘T’ien-tzu’, ‘son of heaven’.^89 Thomas considers<BR>that this title used by the Kuṣāṇas must have been borrowed<BR>from the Hsiung-nu (a Central Asian Tribe) and not directly<BR>from the Chinese.^90 Narain also believes the title to have been<BR>borrowed by the Kuṣāṇas from Central Asia.^91 The title has<BR>been frequently used by the kings in the Kharoṣṭhī documents<BR>discovered from Chinese Turkestan.^92 As regards the origin of<BR>the title, the divinity of the kings has been stressed upon in<BR>many ancient empires.^93 The ancient Indian concept for ‘Deva-<BR>putra’^94 meaning ‘god-son’ is slightly different. It was not used<BR>for worldly kings but specifically for a class of distinguished<BR>divinities, which in Indian Buddhist texts was specifically used<BR>for four regional ‘great kings’, i. e., regents of four quarters,<BR>East, West, North and South who were ‘sons of heaven’. In<BR>the later Kuṣāṇa times, the term seems to have denoted the<BR>sense of Royal insignia.^95 In a Buddhist text of this period the<BR>question is raised ‘why kings are called devaputra’ and the<BR>answer is that before being born as a man, he was abiding<BR>among the gods (devas) and that, because the thirty-three gods<BR>(each) contributed to his substance, therefore, he is ‘god-son’.^96<BR>That Daivaputra denotes the Kuṣāṇas is obvious, since, no<BR>other Indian king is known to have been styled ‘devaputra’.<BR>Though Indian kings were usually addressed as ‘Deva’, we do<BR>not find any evidence of an Indian king referring to himself as<BR>deva. The Kuṣāṇas did not adopt devaputra as an official title<BR>in early times. It is totally absent from their coins, its reading<BR>on one coin of Kujula Kara Kaphsa being an error which<BR>has been noticed by Thomas after re-examining the coin in<BR>consultation with Allan.^97 Kaniṣka has not used the title even<BR>in Peshawar Casket Inscriptions which were officially engraved.<BR>It is only in documents inscribed by Indians that the title<BR>‘devaputra’ is used for the Kuṣāṇa kings.^98 The title is used for<BR>the first time for Kaniṣka (known as Candana Kaniṣka).^99<BR>Mahārāja -rājātirāja devaputra Kuṣāṇa of the Taxila Silver<BR>Scroll Inscription is generally taken to refer to Kaniṣka.^100<BR>As rightly observed by Thomas “the devaputrasa of the scroll<BR>inscription is the first known instance of the application to<BR>the Kuṣāṇas of the designation devaputra, which regularly,<BR>though not invariably, recurs with Kaniṣka and his succes-<BR>sors.”^101<BR>Thus we do not find the title Devaputra being used by<BR>the Kuṣāṇa rulers themselves but was applied to them by the<BR>Indians. Why of all ruling dynasties only the Kuṣāṇas were<BR>designated as ‘Devaputras’ is really inexplicable. Thomas<BR>suggests two possibilities. It may be due to the fact that the<BR>Indians saw some similarity between the figures of the grand<BR>Yakṣa and those of the burly Kusāṇa kings and the superior<BR>title of ‘Devaputra’ may have appeared to be a suitable appel-<BR>lation. Another possibility is that they found some similarity<BR>between the Kuṣāṇa kings and Kubera (described in India as<BR>regent of the north and god of wealth and known as Devaputra<BR>in ancient Indian concept of Devaputra which simply means<BR>god-son), especially in view of the lavish gold coinage of the<BR>Kuṣāṇas. Aśvaghoṣa refers to the ‘great king Kanika’ as<BR>‘guardian of the northern heaven’.^102 It is also likely that<BR>the title devaputra may have been given due to Śiva-maheśvara,<BR>whom we have seen styled as Devaputra and who is the sole<BR>deity figured on the coins of Wima Kadphises.^103 These facts<BR>need further investigation.<BR>Most probably from the Epic Period, Indian concept of<BR>Devaputra ‘god-son’ is linked with kings to give them divinity<BR>and not as a title.^104 Aśoka could claim the title only of<BR>‘Devānām priya’^105 meaning ‘the beloved of the gods’. Thus<BR>Devaputra or ‘god-son’ was a superior title given to the Kuṣāṇas<BR>by Indians. It is interesting to note that the epithet Devaputravat<BR>has been used for Buddha in one of our inscriptions^106<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=129&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=317" target="_blank">Correction</a>

Hūṇa (No. 13, L. 15):<BR>They are mentioned in the Bhītarī Stone Pillar Inscription<BR>of Skandagupta in which Skandagupta (A.D. 455 — 467) is<BR>stated to have inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Hūṇas: “By<BR>whose (Skandagupta's) two arms the earth was shaken, when<BR>he, the creator (of a disturbance like that) of a terrible whirl-<BR>pool, joined in close conflict with the Hūṇas...”.^107 The defeat<BR>inflated upon the Hūṇas proved so decisive that for nearly<BR>half a century the Gupta empire was immune from their<BR>depredations.^108<BR>Hūṇas, also known as Ephthalites or Hiung-nu were a<BR>Central Asian tribe.<BR>Uigur^109 transcribes the name of the tribe in ancient<BR>Chinese in two phonetic forms: one of which is ‘xūnu or xunu’,<BR>the other ‘xunux, xunuo, xunu’. The first part (xun — ) of the last<BR>form is not in doubt and neither is the u of the last part, the<BR>only question is about the change of the initial i of ancient<BR>Chinese into y in Uigur before u and in Sandhi, and about<BR>the pronunciation of the final consonant.^110<BR>The first of the above Chinese forms which comes as close<BR>to the Hunu as to the Sanskrit Hūṇa is very similar to the<BR>Chinese “transcription” Xunu or Xūnu, and Avesta Hunu,<BR>except the Sanskrit has substituted for the final root vowel ‘u’<BR>the stem final — a characteristic of the names of peoples in that<BR>language. “The Purāṇas have a form Urṇa which together with<BR>Epic Skr. Hūṇa suggests Indic Hūrṇa Turk, Xūrnu”.^111<BR>We may note here the Tibetan Hor, which corresponds<BR>with the first syllable of the reconstructed form Hūr-ṇa. The<BR>difference of vowels may indicate a back diphthong or back<BR>vowel between o and u, as Ptolemy's Xoūnoi suggests, since<BR>the Greeks wrote u (y) for Indic u.^112<BR>Though all the above forms go back to one primitive form,<BR>we cannot say the same for the people to whom they were<BR>applied. The general opinion is that the Hsiung-nus, Huns,<BR>Hūṇas etc., were Turks. Some scholars consider them to have<BR>been a mixture of many tribes, Iranians, Mongols, and Paleosi-<BR>birians (ancestors of the Yenissei-ostyaks). Whatever may have<BR>been the dominant race or speech was, it can be seen that<BR>there must have been several subject people and subject armies<BR>in such far-flung empires, necessitating some mixture and<BR>mutual influence — ethnic, linguistic and cultural.^113 Otto<BR>Maenchen-Helfen has discussed the whole question on the<BR>basis of the evidence of language, history, ethnology,<BR>and archaeology^114 and has pointed out that the greater part<BR>of the Hsiung-nu vocabulary pointed to Mongol^115 Later<BR>Pelliot considered the same vocabulary and established that the<BR>Hsiung-nu and Huns were Turks.^116<BR>Louis Bazin^117 and Von Gabain^118 also reached the conclu-<BR>sion that in language of the Hsiung-nu there was a high percent-<BR>age of Turkish words.^119<BR>In the second century B.C. the Hiung-nu (Huns) started a<BR>movement near the Chinese frontier and succeeded in destroying<BR>the Greco-Bactrian empire, in strongly menacing the existence<BR>of the house of Arsakes, and in landing crowds of Central<BR>Asian invaders within the borders of India. In the latter half<BR>of the fourth century A.D., a branch of them, the White Huns,<BR>or Ephthalites, flooded the South of Asia; and ‘about the time<BR>when the last legions of Rome shattered on the plains of<BR>Chalons, the motley hordes of Attila, the White Huns had<BR>begun to tread Sassanian Persia under the hoofs of their<BR>horses, and were soon to smash the Indian empire of the<BR>Guptas into pieces’.^120<BR>In A.D. 484 the Hūṇas killed the Sassanian ruler of Persia.<BR>Towards the close of the fifth century A.D. they ruled over a<BR>vast empire with their principal capital at Balkh.^121 We know<BR>of a Hūṇa-deśa placed to the South of the Kāma-giri and to<BR>the North of Maru-deśa, i. e., the desert called the land of<BR>heroes. The Harṣacarita places the Hūṇa country in the Punjab<BR>region practically suggesting the same area.^122<BR>In the middle of the sixth century A.D., the Sassanian king<BR>of Persia made an alliance with Western Turks against the<BR>Hūṇas and smashed their rule from the Oxus by killing their<BR>king sometime between A.D. 563 and 567.^123<BR>We know of Toramāṇa from his Eraṇ Boar Inscription^124<BR>and of Mihirakula from his Gwalior Inscription.^125 These<BR>two are generally taken to have been Hūṇa chiefs. There is<BR>another inscription found at Kura (Salt range in the Punjab)<BR>referring to Rājādhirāja Mahārāja Toramāṇa-Ṣāhi-Jau (bla),<BR>whom some scholars identify with king Toramāṇa mentioned<BR>in the Eraṇ Inscription,^126 but others regard the two as quite<BR>different.^127 Here it must be pointed out, none of these inscrip-<BR>tions describes any of these kings as Hūṇas nor contains any<BR>reference to the Hūṇas.<BR>We find an interesting account of Toramāṇa in the Jain<BR>work, Kuvalayamālā, composed to 700 Śaka (A.D. 778).^128 Here<BR>Toramāṇa is stated to have lived on the bank of the Candrab-<BR>hāgā (Chenab river). His guru Hari-gupta, who himself was a<BR>scion of the Gupta family, also lived there.^129<BR>Both Toramāṇa and Mihirakula are referred to in the Rāja-<BR>taraṅgiṇī, but there is no mention of their being the Hūṇas.<BR>It is doubtful whether Toramāṇa and Mihirakula were Hūṇas<BR>or Kuṣāṇas. Sir Aurel Stein, Jayaswal^130 and Fleet^131 held that<BR>Toramāṇa was a Kuṣāṇa. But Sten Konow^132 holds that Tora-<BR>māṇa was, in all probability, a Hūṇa, as is generally assumed,<BR>and not a Kuṣāṇa. It is not unlikely that the Hūṇas and the<BR>Kuṣāṇas were ethnically allied and were later merged into a<BR>new nation, which came to be known as Hūṇa in India.^133<BR>There are several stray references to the Hūṇas in Indian<BR>literature. D.C. Sircar^134 opines that the Indian names Hūṇa,<BR>Hārahūṇa or Hārahūra, supposed to be associated with the<BR>Chinese name Hiung-nu and ‘the White Hun’ of the European<BR>writers, are mentioned in a few late passages of the Mahābhārata<BR>and in the geographical sections of the early Purāṇas, can be<BR>roughly assigned to the 4th century A.D. A sūtra-vṛtti in the<BR>Candra Vyākaraṇa has the sentence ‘ajayad-gupta (or Japto or<BR>Jarto) Hūṇān’ as an illustration of the use of the imperfect to<BR>express an event which occurred within the life-time of the<BR>author.^135<BR>In the Mandasor inscription of Yaśodharman^136 a reference<BR>is made to the chiefs of the Hūṇas, but they are not named.<BR>The inscription simply says that Yaśodharman possessed coun-<BR>tries which not even the Guptas and the chiefs of the Hūṇas<BR>could subdue.^137<BR>The inscription also refers to Mihirakula “who had earlier<BR>bowed only to the god Sthāṇu (Śiva) and whose forehead was<BR>pained through being bent low down by the strength of the arm<BR>of Yaśodharman in the act of compelling obeisance”.^138<BR>With the fall of Yaśodharman, which probably took place<BR>not long after, Mihirakula again came to the forefront. In the<BR>early part of the sixth century A.D. Śākala become his capital.^139<BR>The Gupta king who then occupied the imperial throne was<BR>probably Narasiṃha-Gupta Bālāditya. He was temporarily over-<BR>whelmed by the victorious raids of Yaśodharman, and Mihirak-<BR>ula evidently took advantage of this imperial crisis to extend<BR>his power. Narasiṃhagupta, according to Hiuen Tsang, was<BR>forced to the humiliating position of paying tribute to Mihira-<BR>kula but finally triumphed over his rival.^140<BR>The defeat of Mihirakula appears to have finally crushed<BR>the political supremacy of the Hūṇas in India who ceased to<BR>be even a disturbing element in Indian History.^141 The Purāṇas<BR>place the Hūṇas in the extreme west, with the Sauvīras,<BR>Saindhavas, Śākalas and Madras.^142<BR>In the Raghuvaṃśa, Kālidāsa mentions Raghu defeating<BR>the Hūṇas on the banks of the Vaṅkṣu or the Oxus^143, the (pale)<BR>faces of whose wives spoke of the bravery of their husbands<BR>(who died in the battle).^144<BR>Varāhamihira^145 mentions them under the jurisdiction of<BR>Ketu and places them in the North.^146 Dr. Upendra Thakur^147<BR>remarks that about the sixth century A.D., the Hūṇas almost<BR>lost their original name of Hiong-nou or Huns. Later the powerful<BR>Turks give its name to the entire Hūṇa nation by which they<BR>were further known in the neighbouring nations. Afterwards<BR>they were submerged in the Mongols under the influence of the<BR>powerful Mongol Chief Chengiz Khan. Thus, the Hiong-nou or<BR>Huns received different names in different periods beginning<BR>with their origin to their advancement in other countries. In<BR>spite of the copious references to the Ephthalites in the accounts<BR>of the different countries, it is very difficult to determine their<BR>exact origin and ethnic affinities.<BR>We can partly agree with Dr. Thakur as regards their<BR>merger in the area later dominated by the Turks and Mongols<BR>but the Hūṇas find their mention in the Harṣa-Carita of Bāṇa<BR>(a seventh century work) and they remained a potent force in<BR>the social and political life of the Punjab-Rajasthan-Malwa-<BR>Gujarat region during the early medieval period as evidenced<BR>by a large number of epigraphical and literary records, and<BR>also proved themselves as a source of danger to the Pāla kings<BR>of Bengal^148<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=131&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=318" target="_blank">Correction</a>

8. Kotas (No. 1, L. 14):<BR>The Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta mentions<BR>Samudragupta's capturing a king born in the family of the<BR>Kotas.^162 Mookerji equates the Kota-kulaja of the inscription<BR>with king Kalyāṇavarman of the play ‘Kaumudī-Mahotsava’.^163<BR>But it is now generally believed^164 that ‘the episode of the<BR>Kaumudī-Mahotsava has no bearing whatsoever on the early<BR>Gupta History’.<BR>The coins of the Kotas bearing their name have been found<BR>in East Punjab, and Delhi, and ‘they probably ruled in the<BR>Upper Gangetic valley’.^165 Scholars differ in their views<BR>about placing the Kotas; some identify it with Kanyakubja<BR>while others with Pāṭaliputra.^166<BR>It is known that Puṣpapura or Kusumapura was the name of<BR>both the Pāṭaliputra and Kānyakubja.^167 It must, however, be<BR>noted that the city of Puṣpa here is connected mainly with<BR>Samudragupta and not with the Kota-kulaja,^168 so the location<BR>of the city of the Kotas is not to be traced in Kusumapura or<BR>Puṣpapura. It is well known that Candragupta I received<BR>Magadha through his Licchavi-alliance and it is possible that<BR>Samudragupta enjoyed his youth playfully at Pāṭaliputra<BR>(Puṣpa-āhvaye krīḍatā).

कुरुस्
9. Kurus (No. 22, L. 7):<BR>The Kurus were divided into two branches, the Northern and<BR>the Southern.^171 We have here a reference to the Uttarakurus.^172<BR>The Kurus were one of the most ancient and prominent of<BR>the Indo-Āryan kṣatriya tribes.^173 In the earliest literature the<BR>Kurus do not appear under that name as a people. But<BR>mention is made of a prince, Kuruśravaṇa (Glory of the<BR>Kurus)^174 and of a Pākasthāman Kauravyāyaṇa.^175 The Athar-<BR>vaveda^176 refers to Parīkṣita as a king of the Kurus and his<BR>son, Janamejaya, is mentioned in the Śātapatha Brāhmaṇa^177<BR>as one of the great performers of the horse sacrifice.<BR>Oldenberg^178 seems to be right in suggesting that the<BR>Kuru people, as known later, included some of the tribes<BR>referred to by other names in the Ṛgveda. Kuruśravaṇa,<BR>shown by his name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the<BR>Ṛgveda called Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’<BR>who is well known as a king of the Purus. Moreover, it is<BR>likely that the Tṛtsu-Bharatas, who appear in the Ṛgveda as<BR>enemies of the Purus, later coalesced with them to form the<BR>Kuru people.^179 Moreover, there is evidence that the Bharatas<BR>occupied the territory in which the Kurus were later found.<BR>Two of them are spoken of in a hymn of the Ṛgveda^180 as<BR>having kindled fire on the Dṛṣadvatī, the Āpayā, and the<BR>Sarasvatī — that is to say, in the sacred places of the later<BR>Kurukshetra.^181<BR>In the Brāhmaṇa literature, the Kurus are often con-<BR>nected with Pāñcālas.^182<BR>The territory of the Kuru-Pāñcālas is declared in the<BR>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa to be the middle country (Madhyadeśa).^183<BR>A group of the Kuru people still remained further north — the<BR>Uttara Kurus beyond the Himalayas.^184 It appears from a<BR>passage of the Śātapatha Brāhmaṇa that the speech of the<BR>Northerners-that is, presumably the Northern Kurus-and of the<BR>Kuru — Pāñcālas was similar, and regarded as specially pure.^185<BR>There seems little doubt that the Brahmanical Culture was<BR>developed in the country of the Kuru-Pāñcālas, and that it<BR>spread thence east, south and west. ^186<BR>The Uttara Kurus, who play a mythical part in the Epic<BR>and later literature, are still a historical people in the Aitareya<BR>Brāhmaṇa.^187 where they are located beyond the Himalayas<BR>(pareṇa Himavantam). In another passage,^188 however, the<BR>country of the Uttara Kurus is stated by Vasiṣṭha Sāthavya<BR>to be a land of the gods (deva-kṣetra), but Jānṃtapi<BR>Atyarāti was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not wholly<BR>mythical. It is reasonable to accept Zimmer's view that the<BR>northern Kurus were settled in Kashmir, especially as Kuruk-<BR>shetra is the region where tribes advancing from Kashmir<BR>might naturally be found.^189 In Buddhist literature, Uttara-<BR>Kuru is very often mentioned as a mythic region, but there are<BR>some passages which go to show that there was a faint memory<BR>of a country that once had a historical existence.^190<BR>Some time before the fourth century B.C., the monarchical<BR>constitution of the Kurus gave place to a republic, for we are<BR>told by Kauṭilya^191 that the Kurus were ‘rāja-śabdopajīvinaḥ’,<BR>or ‘enjoying the status of rājan’ — i. e. all citizens had equal rank<BR>and rights.^192<BR>Shafer^193 shows that only the upper castes of the Kauravas<BR>were Āryan, the bulk of the population were probably non-<BR>Āryan as is clear from the fact that whereas the Kauravas<BR>rallied the support mostly of the non-Āryans, the Pāṇḍavas<BR>had the support of Āryans and concludes that the Northern<BR>Kurus were Muṇḍic.^194<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=136&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=322" target="_blank">Correction</a>

The alliance had no social<BR>importance but it was important for political gain by virtue<BR>of which Candragupta I (Samudragupta's father) gained power-<BR>ful position in Magadha and the neighbouring countries. In<BR>the Candragupta-Kumāradevī-coins, we have no mention of<BR>the Guptas but only of the Licchavis in plural ‘Licchavayaḥ’<BR>(the Licchavis). This supports the amalgamation of the<BR>Guptas with the Licchavis and we may agree with Majumdar<BR>that ‘the epithet Licchavi dauhitra was deliberately given to<BR>Samudragupta to emphasize his right of succession to the dual<BR>monarchy’.^195<BR>We also know of a house of the Licchavis at Nepal^196 but<BR>the separate reference to Nepal as a tributary province in the<BR>Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta^197 proves that it<BR>was different from the Licchavi kingdom which Samudragupta<BR>had inherited from his mother. The Licchavi kingdom of<BR>Kumāradevī may be located in North Bihar with Vaiśālī<BR>(modern Basarh in Muzaffarpur district) as its centre.^198 It was<BR>a credit for the astute diplomacy of Candragupta to marry the<BR>Licchavi princess as we know, in ancient times, the Licchavis of<BR>Vaiśālī had been the rivals of the kings of Pāṭaliputra^199 and<BR>that they did not marry outside their area.^200<BR>The name of this powerful people has come to us in many<BR>different readings:<BR>Licchavi, Lecchavi, Lecchai, Lecchaki, Licchvi, Nicchivi,<BR>Lichikki and Lichavi.<BR>Of these the Licchavi has been most commonly used in<BR>literature.^201<BR>The earliest mention of this people is in Kauṭilya's Artha-<BR>śāstra,^202 where they are called Licchavis. Here we read that<BR>the corporations of Licchivi, Vṛji, Malla, Madra, Kakura,<BR>Kuru, Pañcāla and others were ‘rājaśabdopajīvinaḥ’. It is note-<BR>worthy that Kauṭilya distinguishes the Licchavis from the Vṛjis<BR>though some scholars consider them to be one.^203 H. Pandey^204<BR>says that it appears from the Pali suttas that the names Vajji<BR>and Licchavi are interchangeable to some extent. But the<BR>accounts of Chinese pilgrims point to a different conclusion.<BR>Fa-Hien describes the kingdom of Vaiśālī where ‘Licchavis’<BR>were the people of the country. He does not mention Vṛji or<BR>Vajji. Hiuen Tsang describes Vaiśālī and Vṛji as two distinct<BR>countries, and Watters is inclined to doubt the accuracy of his<BR>description of the Vṛji country.^205 But we know that Vajji was<BR>a powerful confederacy of which the Videhas along with the<BR>Licchavis, Jñātrikas, Ugras, Bhojas and others were the cons-<BR>tituent confederate clans (aṭṭhakula). Of these the Licchavis and<BR>the Videhas were the most important, and the Licchavi Capital<BR>Vaiśālī was the head-quarter of the confederacy.^206 But Ray<BR>Chaudhuri observes: “Vajji was not only the name of the<BR>confederacy but also of one of the constituent clans. But the<BR>Vajjis like the Licchavis are sometimes associated with the<BR>city of Vaiśālī which was not only the capital of the Licchavi<BR>clan, but also the metropolis of the entire confederacy”.^207 The<BR>Licchavi republic was generally called the saṃgha or gaṇa of<BR>the Vajjis. The Licchavis would not possibly have allowed this<BR>name, had they not themselves been Vajjians. In one passage,<BR>the Licchavi Mahānāma, seeing that a band of young Licchavis<BR>who had been out hunting were gathered round the Buddha, is<BR>represented as saying, “They (i. e. the Licchavis) will become<BR>Vajjians, they will become Vajjians (bhavissanti Vajji bhavis-<BR>santi Vajji)”! This possibly only means that there was great<BR>hope of these Licchavi young men becoming true Vajjians,<BR>practising the seven conditions of welfare taught by the<BR>Buddha, conditions which endured their prosperity, and lead-<BR>ing a more cultured life. Thus the Vajji appears to be a more<BR>dignified term. It might have originally been given to the tribe<BR>which inhabited what is known as Vajjiraṭṭha (Vṛji-rāṣṭra), i. e.,<BR>the Vajjian country, in Buddhist literature. Later a separation<BR>seems to have taken place among the Vajjis and Licchavis,<BR>because the Arthaśāstra (XI. I) mentions the Licchavika and<BR>the Vṛjika as two distinct republics.^208<BR>The clan of the Licchavis figures very prominently in the<BR>annals of early Buddhism. Buddhaghoṣa, the celebrated Pali<BR>commentator has the following story^209: The chief queen of<BR>the king of Benaras, at the time of her child-birth delivered<BR>lump of flesh, ‘of the colour of lac and of bandhu and Jīvaka<BR>flowers’. Fearing the displeasure of the king if he should hear<BR>of this, the other queens put the lump of flesh into a casket<BR>marked with royal seal and placed it on the flowing waters of<BR>the Ganges. The casket was discovered by an ascetic, and<BR>taken by him to his hermitage, where he cared for the lump of<BR>flesh. After the lapse of some time, tha lump broke up into<BR>two pieces of flesh, which gradually assumed shape, till finally<BR>one of them became a boy resplendent like gold, and the other a<BR>girl. Whatever entered the stomach of these two infants looked<BR>as if put into a vessel of precious transparent stone (maṇi)<BR>so that they seemed to have no skin (Nicchavi). Others said: ‘the<BR>two were attached to each other by their skin (līna-chavi) as if<BR>they had been sewn together’; so that these infants came to be<BR>designated ‘Licchavis’. We are further told that on coming of<BR>age the boy and the girl were married to each other and from<BR>this brother and sister union sprang the race of the Licchavis^210<BR>The origin of the Licchavis has been a matter of great<BR>controversy. They have been represented as Scythians, Kolari-<BR>ans, Tibetans and Persians by different authorities.^211<BR>Samuel Beal^212 takes the Licchavis or Vajjis to be a<BR>branch of the ‘Yue-Chi’ forgetting that the latter came to India<BR>in the first century B.C. while the Licchavis were a highly<BR>civilized and prosperous people in the sixth century B.C.<BR>In the opinion of J.P. Hewitt, there are “very strong<BR>indications that the Vajjians, who were certainly the earliest<BR>settlers in the country, were of Kolarian race who had lived<BR>there long before the arrival of the Dravidians and Āryans”.<BR>The learned writer ignores the existence of the pre-Vajjian<BR>Āryan dynasty of rulers at Vaiśālī.^213<BR>V.A. Smith^214 found similarities between the customs of<BR>the Tibetans and those of the Licchavis in the practice of the<BR>exposure of the dead and also in judicial procedure. And<BR>hence he came to the conclusion that the Licchavis, the<BR>ruling tribe or clan in Vṛji country of which Vaiśālī was the<BR>capital, was really a Tibetan (or Mongolian) tribe which settled<BR>in the plains during the prehistoric times. The view has been<BR>criticised by B.C. Law, K.P. Jayaswal, H.C. Raychaudhuri<BR>and others on the following grounds^215:<BR>(1) The custom of the disposal of the dead was prevalent<BR>among the Vedic Āryans from whom the Licchavis<BR>were descended;<BR>(2) In the case of Tibet we have only three courts as<BR>against the seven tribunals of the Licchavis; further<BR>we know very little about the relative antiquity of the<BR>Tibetan procedure which might very well have been<BR>suggested by the system expounded in the Aṭṭhakathā.<BR>S.C. Vidyābhūṣaṇa^216 suggests a Persian origin for the<BR>Licchavis holding that the name Licchavi (Nicchavi of Manu,<BR>X. 22) was derived from the Persian city of Nisibis. There<BR>is very little in Vidyābhūṣaṇa's surmise except a fancied<BR>resemblance between the names Nicchivi and Nisibis. Inscrip-<BR>tions of the Achaemenids are silent about any Persian settle-<BR>ment in the Eastern India in the sixth or fifth century B.C. The<BR>Licchavi people were more interested in Yakṣa caityas and the<BR>teaching of Mahāvīra and the Buddha than in the deities and<BR>Prophets of Iran.^217<BR>The Licchavis have been invariably represented as kṣatriyas<BR>in ancient Indian literature. As the Mahāparinibbāṇa-Sutta<BR>informs us, they claimed a share of the remnants of the<BR>Buddha's body on the ground that they were kṣatriyas like the<BR>Buddha himself: “The Exalted one was a kṣatriya and so are<BR>we. We are worthy to receive a portion of relies of the Exalted<BR>one”. We get many other similar instances.^218 We find that<BR>both the Śākyas (to whose race the Buddha belonged) and the<BR>Licchavis are described as progenies of brother and sister<BR>unions. Like the Śākyas, the Licchavis are also described as<BR>kṣatriyas.^219 Manu speaks of the Licchavis as kṣatriyas, though<BR>of the Vrātya variety.^220 Regarding the Vrātyas, Manu says:<BR>‘Those (sons) whom the twice-born have by the wives of equal<BR>caste, but who, not fulfilling their scared duties, are excluded<BR>from the initiation to Sāvitrī, one must designate by the appel-<BR>lation vrātyas’.^221<BR>We know that Mahāvīra, the founder of Jainism, was the<BR>very kin of the Licchavis and that he had many followers<BR>among the residents of Vaiśālī, even among the highest officers.<BR>Then again, between the sixth century B.C. and 200 B.C., the<BR>earliest estimated date of the Manusmṛti,^222 the Licchavis had<BR>won the good graces of the Buddha as well as of the followers<BR>of the religion he preached. During this long interval, when the<BR>two great ‘heretic’ faiths flourished in their country, the<BR>Licchavis might not have been particular to the ceremonies and<BR>practices that the regulations of the orthodox brāhmaṇas<BR>required. ‘Hence we can understand how Manu, the great<BR>brāhmaṇa law-giver came to refer to the Licchavis as<BR>Vrātyas’.^223 But Gokhale^224 takes the term kṣatriya in this<BR>context to mean representative of political power rather than<BR>a specific caste in the brahminical hierarchy and from the word<BR>Vrātya infers that they were outside the pale of the brahminical<BR>civilization.<BR>Scholars have divergent views about the connotation of the<BR>word ‘Vrātya’.^225 Charpentier described the Vrātyas, as a band<BR>of people not governed by the rules of caste, probably repre-<BR>senting the worst elements of Indian society, — the thief, the<BR>robber, the drunken one, etc. But Keith rejected this view by<BR>pointing out that Manu's reference to the Rājanya Vrātyas,<BR>e. g. Licchavis and Mallas (X. 22) has no value for Vedic<BR>times.^226 Haver in his article ‘Der Vrātya’ derives ‘Vrātya’<BR>from ‘vrata’. Thus the oldest meaning of ‘Vrāta’ is a group of<BR>people bound by holy ceremonies, bound by a vow to cult-<BR>actions being derived from ‘vrata’ which is a vow taken in the<BR>service of a god. The Vrātīnas, on the other hand, ‘were<BR>Aryans of a more primitive culture and religion, than the<BR>orthodox brāhmaṇas, and were organised in cult-unions and<BR>both ‘vrātya’ and ‘vrātīna’ being derived from ‘vrata’ are<BR>‘members of the same holy union’. The only difference between<BR>them apparently was that the Vrātīna went to the brāhmaṇa<BR>countries to perform the Vrātya-work and were paid for it,<BR>while the Vrātyas acted in their own homeland.^227<BR>From all these considerations, we can see that the views of<BR>Manu and the suggestion of B.C. Law are more tenable. In<BR>the Nepāla Vaṃśāvalī, the Licchavis are allotted to the Sūrya-<BR>vaṃśa or solar race of the kṣatriyas.^228 This is quite in agree-<BR>ment with the fact elicited from the Buddhist records that they<BR>were Vāsiṣṭhas by Gotra, for we know from the Aitareya<BR>Brāhmaṇa^229 that the gotra or pravara (family) of a kṣatriya is<BR>the same as that of his purohita or family-priest. The Vasiṣṭha<BR>gotra was, therefore, the gotra of their family priest, and we<BR>know that the Vasiṣṭhas were the family priests of the kings of<BR>the solar race, especially of the Ikṣvākus.^230<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=138&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=323" target="_blank">Correction</a>

11. Madrakas (No. I, L. 22):<BR>One of the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta. We also know<BR>of Madra as a personal name in No. 15, L. 8.<BR>Madras claimed descent from an eponymous king Madraka,<BR>son of Śibi Auśīnara, and were septs of the family of Śivi<BR>like the Kaikeyas.^231<BR>According to Dr. Buddha Prakash ‘Bhadra’ was another<BR>Variant of Madra.^232 But this view is not acceptable to us.<BR>The Mahābhārata^233 mentions the Bhadras, but only in the<BR>Bombay recension; the Calcutta recension has Madra.^234 We<BR>know that Bhadra and Madra had independent existence, as<BR>found in the legend of Bhadrā Kākṣīvatī, bride of Vyuṣi-<BR>tāśva.^235 The queen had seven children, three Śālvas and<BR>four Madras. ^236<BR>The Candravṛtti on Candra^237 informs us that Udumbara,<BR>Tilakhala, Madrakāra, Yugandhara, Bhuliṅga and Śaradaṇḍa,<BR>are the divisions of Sālva (or Śālva). The word Śālva literally<BR>means an animal like stag or gazelle which bespeaks of<BR>Scythian origin.^238 Buddha Prakash connects it with the<BR>modern sub-caste Saluja (Skt. Sālvaja). Anyhow, we know that<BR>Madras were a branch of Śālvas who were sons of Bhadra.<BR>J. Przyluski^239 considers the Madras to have been a section of<BR>the Bhadras on the ground that the former had among their<BR>ancestress a queen named Bhadrā. Both the Bhadras and the<BR>Madrakas are mentioned separately in the Bṛhatsaṃhitā,^240 the<BR>Bhadras with the Śālvas in the Madhyadeśa (Middle land)<BR>and the Madrakas with the Mālavas in the northern quarter.<BR>Nakula and Sahadeva were the sons of Pāṇḍu by his<BR>wife Mādrī. The name of their mother Mādrī suggests their<BR>connection with the clan of the Madras.^241 Since Bālhiki<BR>(Bāhlika stands for the Bactrians) was the title of Mādrī,<BR>Madras were of Irano-Bactrian origin; the Madras may rep-<BR>resent the Iranian tribe, Māda or Mede.^242<BR>The Madras were an ancient kṣatriya tribe.^243 We do not<BR>find their mention in the early Vedic Saṃhitās but the Vaṃśa<BR>Brāhmaṇa (of the Sāmaveda) tells us of a Vedic teacher named<BR>Madra-gāra Śauṅgāyani (‘descendant of Śuṅga’) whose pupil<BR>was Kāmboja Aupamanyava.^244 Zimmer^245 concludes, with pro-<BR>bability, that these names point to a connexion of the Kambojas<BR>and the Madras. We know from the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa^246<BR>that the Madra country was the chief centre of Vedic learning.<BR>We know of a Kāpya Patañcala amongst the Madras who<BR>was a famous teacher of Vedic lore.^247<BR>The Uttara Madras, the ‘northern Madras’ are referred<BR>to in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa^248 as living beyond the Himalaya<BR>(pareṇa himavantam) in the neighbourhood of the Uttara<BR>Kurus, probably, as Zimmer^249 conjectures, in the land of<BR>Kashmira. The Madras mentioned in the Upaniṣads were, like<BR>the Kurus, probably settled somewhere in Kurukshetra in the<BR>Madhyadeśa or ‘Middle Land’.^250<BR>Pāṇini^251 mentions two divisions of the Madras, Pūrva<BR>(eastern) and Apara (Western). In the Bṛhatsaṃhitā they are<BR>mentioned twice; firstly as Madra situated in West in Vāyavya<BR>Koṇa,^252 and secondly as Madraka with Mālava in the<BR>North.^253<BR>In the Rāmāyaṇa, we read that Sugrīva sent monkeys to<BR>the Madrakas and other tribes in quest of Sītā.^254 The Madra<BR>tribe or kingdom^255 is mentioned in the Bhīṣmaparvan of the<BR>Mahābhārata (chap. IX) and in Pāṇini's grammar (II, 3, 73;<BR>IV, 4, 67). The Madras held the Central portions of the<BR>Punjab;^256 they appear in the Epic period to have occupied<BR>the district of Sialkot, between the rivers Chenab and Ravi,^257<BR>or according to some between the Jhelum and the Ravi.^258<BR>S.B. Chaudhuri^259 says that the Madras held the portion in<BR>the Doab between the Chenab and the Ravi, possibly com-<BR>prising even a portion of the country between the Jhelum and<BR>the Chenab, and thus abutted on Kaikeya on the West.<BR>We get a clue to the inhabitance of the Madras from a verse<BR>in the Karṇaparvan of the Mahābhārata^260 which refers to a<BR>Madra, who had come to live among the Kurus, as yearning<BR>for his return to his native place beyond the Śatadru and the<BR>Irāvatī to enjoy the company of charming women.<BR>Śākala (Pali-Sagala, modern Sialkot) was the capital of the<BR>Madras identified^261 with Sanglawala-Tiba, to the West of the<BR>Ravi. From the Milinda-pañho, we learn that king Milinda<BR>(Menander) a Graeco-Bactrian king, who became a convert to<BR>Buddhism, was ruling over the Madda country with Sagala as<BR>his capital which according to a Buddhist lexicon, was one of<BR>the twenty ancient cities.^262 The brahminical name^263 of the<BR>Madra Capital was Śākala mentioned by Pāṇini^264 as Sānkala.<BR>In the Mahābhārata^265 and the Jātakas^266 Śākala is described<BR>as standing on the bank of the Āpagā in a tongue of land<BR>between two rivers, called the Śākaladvīpa, which corresponds<BR>to the Rechna Doab.<BR>We know from the Mahābhārata about Śalya, king of the<BR>Madras (Madrarāja). ^267 After severe fighting, and many<BR>vicissitudes, the Madra soldiers were killed by Arjuna.^268<BR>The Madras are mentioned in the Purāṇas as well.^269 The<BR>Viṣṇu Purāṇa^270 refers to the Madras along with the Ārāmas,<BR>Pārasīkas, and others and in the Matsya Purāṇa^271 with<BR>Gāndhāra, Yavana and others. The latter^272 mentions king<BR>Aśvapati of Śākala in the kingdom of the Madras.<BR>The Madras, according to the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya^273<BR>were a corporation of warriors and people enjoyed the title of<BR>rājan (rājaśabdopajīvinaḥ).^274<BR>Madra women were noted for their beauty. ^275 The Jātakas<BR>bear ample testimony to the fact that the Madra princesses<BR>were sought in marriage by the great kṣatriya house of North<BR>India.^276 The Mahābhārata tells us that it was a family custom<BR>of the Madras to receive a fee from the bridegroom when they<BR>gave their daughters in marriage.^277<BR>Some scholars identify the Madras with Vāhlika (or<BR>Vāhīka).^278 Śākala as a Vāhīkagrāma is also mentioned by<BR>Patañjali.^279 From the references in the Mahābhārata, Vāhīka<BR>would appear to have stood for the whole of Punjab.^280 The<BR>Vāhīka-grāmas of Śākala and Pātanaprastha, as referred to<BR>in the grammatical works,^281 imply the inclusion of Madra-<BR>janapada in the Vāhīka country.<BR>The Madras are known as low, barbarous^282 and sinful<BR>people.^283 They are mentioned as base, impure and contemp-<BR>tible.^284 “Amongst the Madrakas all acts of friendship are<BR>lost”^285 and so it is said: “Neither one should create enmity, nor<BR>friendship with a Madraka”.^286 The Rājataraṅgiṇī also records<BR>similar views.^287<BR>But the advent of the Jarttikas or Jartas (modern Jāṭs) who<BR>spread over the whole of Punjab was responsible for the degene-<BR>ration of the Madras.^288 The legend of Sāvitrī and Satyavan<BR>is connected with the Madra country, for Sāvitrī was the<BR>daughter of Aśvapati, king of Madra.^289 In the Udyogaparvan<BR>the camp of Śalya is described as full of warriors, whose strange<BR>armours, bows and banners, unfamiliar trappings, vehicles and<BR>equipment and local costumes, ornaments and deportment<BR>presented a unique spectacle in the country of the Kurus. ^290<BR>In the early part of the sixth century A.D. the Madra<BR>country passed under the rule of the Hūṇa conqueror Mihira-<BR>kula (A.D. 515-535) who ruled from Sialkot.

12. Mālava (No. 1, L. 22; No. 17, L. 19; No. 32, L. 11):<BR>We know Mālava as a tribe which was subjugated along with<BR>some other tribes by Samudragupta (No. 1). No. 17 refers to the<BR>Mālava-gaṇa^292 which has been translated by Fleet as ‘the tribal<BR>constitution of the Mālavas’ in the sense of the event of some<BR>formal establishment of the Mālavas’ as a tribe.^293 Fleet fixes<BR>it up as 57-56 B.C.^294 Thomas^295 translates the expression as<BR>“the continuance (sthiti) of the tribal constitution (gaṇa) of<BR>the Mālavas” and adds “It was to gaṇa-sthiti, not to gaṇa, that<BR>I gave the meaning of ‘tribal constitution’; and I did not intro-<BR>duce the idea of ‘Continuance’.” My amended translation is<BR>“the usage of the Mālava tribe.”^296 Thus the expression ‘Māla-<BR>vānām gaṇa’ refers to the Mālavas as a tribe. No. 32 speaks of<BR>the Mālava-vaṃśa which has been translated as ‘the race of<BR>the Mālavas,^297 but it would be better to translate it as “the<BR>dynasty of the Mālavas”.^298 It seems that this tribe had esta-<BR>blished independent rulership and so we find the word ‘vaṃśa’<BR>used where the word ‘gaṇa’ could also be used^299<BR>Dr. Buddha Prakash holds that Madras and Mālavas were<BR>the same, in Prakrit Madra becomes Malla, as ‘dra’ is changed<BR>into ‘ll’. He identifies Malla with the Malloi of the Greeks<BR>and Mālava of the Epic. He points out that the sons of Aśva-<BR>pati, king of the Madras, were called Mālavas after their<BR>mother, according to decree of Yama which shows that Madra<BR>and Mālava were identical.^300<BR>But we venture to disagree with the learned scholar. The<BR>Bṛhatsaṃhitā mentions Madraka and Mālava separately but<BR>side by side as people of the North.^301<BR>At the time of Samudragupta, the Mālavas possibly lived in<BR>Rajasthan and West Malwa^302 consisting of Mewar, Tonk and<BR>adjoining regions of south-east Rajasthan.^303 They settled in<BR>various localities in Western India after having migrated from<BR>the Punjab where they had fought with Alexander on the lower<BR>banks of Ravi.^304 Their original home was in Jhang District,<BR>Punjab. ^305 Subsequently they became the inhabitants of Malwa<BR>and the Vikrama era derived its original appellation from<BR>them.^306 That the Mālavas had migrated to the Jaipur region<BR>(Rajasthan) from the Punjab is supported by the fact that the<BR>legend on some Mālava coins found in Rajasthan reads from<BR>right to left as in Kharoṣṭhī, which was prevalent in the<BR>Punjab and the north-west from very early times.^307 The Sikhs<BR>of Ferozpur, Ludhiana, Patiala, Jind and Malerkotala are<BR>still known as Mālava Sikhs, probably, because these regions<BR>were populated by the Mālavas in ancient times.^308 Mālava<BR>and Mālavaka are also to be differentiated, the former is<BR>Mālava proper while the latter is lesser Mālava with the diminu-<BR>tive suffix ‘ka’.^309<BR>Mālava is the same as Malloi of the Greeks.^310 Pāṇini does<BR>not mention them by name, but his sūtra, V. 3. 117 speaks of<BR>‘āyudhajīvī saṃghas’, or tribes living by the profession of arms,<BR>and the Kāśikā says that amongst these saṃghas were the<BR>Mālavas and Kṣudrakas.^311 The Mālava tribe is actually men-<BR>tioned in the Mahābhaṣya of Patañjali.^312<BR>The Mahābhārata couples the Mālavas with the Tri-<BR>garttas,^313 as well as with the Śivis and Ambaṣṭhas.^314 But<BR>soon they migrated southwards and settled somewhere in Rajas-<BR>than where we find them at the time of Samudragupta.^315<BR>Many coins found at Nagar, 45 miles north of Kota, have the<BR>legend. “Mālavānām jayaḥ” (victory of the Mālavas) in letters<BR>belonging to the period from 250 B.C. to A.D. 250. According<BR>to Cunningham these coins show that the existence of the<BR>Mālavas as a recognised and important clan, long before their<BR>tribal constitution led to the establishment of their era.^316 The<BR>Mālavas came into conflict with Nahapāna's son-in-law Uṣava-<BR>dāta who subdued them.^317<BR>According to the Purāṇas^318 the Mālavas are associated with<BR>the Saurāṣṭras, Avantis, Ābhīras, Śūras, and Arbudas, dwell<BR>along the Pariyātra mountains. Thus they seem to have occupi-<BR>ed other territories besides the Punjab or Rajasthan. Pargiter<BR>points out that even according to the Purāṇas the Mālavas<BR>lived in a ‘mountanious’ country, and were nowhere near pre-<BR>sent Malwa. Mālava king were taken as vrātya and mostly<BR>śūdra in the Purāṇas.^319<BR>The Bhīṣmaparvan of the Mahābhārata mentions the western<BR>(pratīcya) and northern (udīcya) sections of the Mālavas.^320<BR>But the Rāmāyaṇa locates the Mālavas in the east. ^321 Kāma-<BR>sūtra's commentator Jayamaṅgala, who flourished later than<BR>the fourteenth century, says that Āvantika, which is identical<BR>with Ujjayinī-deśa, is apara-Mālava.^322 This has led some<BR>writers to suggest that Mālava proper is Daśārṇa. But Jaya-<BR>maṅgala's geographical knowledge was not perfect.^323 His<BR>remark on Mālava is to be rejected as it runs counter to earlier<BR>authorities. Rājaśekhara mentions Mālava, Avanti and Vidiśā<BR>and the Mañjūśrī mentions Mālava, Vidiśā and Daśārṇa side<BR>by side^324 Modern Malwa is the region around Ujjayinī and<BR>Bhilsa. The influence of the Mālavas in the Mandasor region is<BR>proved by the fact that they could impose their tribal era upon<BR>the Mandasor princes.^325 An inscription describes the subjuga-<BR>tion of Sapta-Mālava by Daṇḍanāyaka Anantapāla, a feudatory<BR>of Vikramāditya VI.^326<BR>The Harṣacarita of Bāṇa refers to the ‘wicked Mālava king’<BR>generally identified with Devagupta, who killed Grahavarman<BR>Maukhari, but was himself defeated by Rājyavardhana.<BR>B.C. Law places the kingdom of Devagupta between Prayāga<BR>and Bhilsa which is identical with Pūrva-Mālava.^327<BR>Thus the Mālavas originally belonged to Jhang District<BR>in Punjab (now in Pakistan), from where they spread all<BR>over Punjab and by the time of Samudragupta had migrated<BR>to Rajasthan. The Mālavas had emerged in 250 B.C. as an<BR>independent tribal state. But they came under the subservience<BR>of the Śakas in the Ist century B.C., to the western kṣatraps<BR>from the 2nd to the 4th centuries A.D. and to Samudragupta<BR>in the 4th century A.D., but this typical native state exerted<BR>itself again.^328 In the period after about A.D. 550 they seem to<BR>have migrated further to the east and covered the region from<BR>Bhilsa (Eastern Malwa) to Prayāga.^329 During the rule of the<BR>Pālas of Bengal they seem to have migrated still further east;<BR>for the copper plates of the Pāla kings (excepting Dharmapāla),<BR>refer to the Mālavas as mercenary troops in their army.^330<BR>The name of the tribe survives in the modern province of<BR>Malwa (a transformation of the word Mālava), and in the brāh-<BR>maṇa castes called ‘Mālavīs’ or ‘Mālavikas’. They are the brāh-<BR>maṇas of Mālava proper and the adjoining country, but are found<BR>also in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.^331<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=146&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=325" target="_blank">Correction</a>

13. Mleccha (No. 14, L. 4):<BR>According to Sircar^332 Fleet conjectures the reading to be<BR>Mleccha. The last few letters in line 4 after ‘ni’ are not legible.<BR>So how Fleet could take this reading without putting any<BR>doubt is really surprising. Mlecchas were amongst the enemies<BR>defeated by Skandagupta in this inscription (No. 14). The war<BR>with the Mlecchas probably refers to his fight with the Hūṇas<BR>which is specifically referred to in the Bhitari Pillar Inscription.<BR>Whether the Mlecchas are the same as Hūṇas or were a<BR>different tribe, both the records (No. 13, No. 14) claim that<BR>Skandagupta completely defeated these enemies.^333 The fact<BR>that in both the inscriptions, the reference to the fight with the<BR>Hūṇas and Mlecchas is preceded by a reference to the falling<BR>fortunes of the family supports the identification.<BR>We also find a reference to the oppression of the earth by<BR>the Mlecchas in the epilogue of the play Mudrā-Rākṣasa written<BR>by Viṣākhadatta where it is prayed that ‘The earth may now be<BR>protected by “His Highness” along with relatives and retinue<BR>by king Candragupta’. It is probable that the play was written<BR>after the Rāmagupta episode and probably the word Mleccha<BR>in this context alludes to the Śakas who were suppressed by<BR>Candragupta II in the guise of the Gupta queen Dhruvasvāminī.<BR>D.C. Sircar^334 is of the view that Mleccha is the name<BR>applied to the Muhammadans and other foreigners. In the<BR>Sanskrit language originally there does not appear to have<BR>been any general term for a foreigner. But as the Dāsa, Dasyu,<BR>Barbara, and Mleccha became more or less absorbed in Āryan<BR>civilization and the original specific meaning of these terms<BR>was no longer remembered, these words came to be used for<BR>any foreigner.^335<BR>The word Mleccha was used to refer to both the eastern and<BR>western Ānavas. In course of time it came to be used for almost<BR>any non-Āryan and even for Āryans of impure speech. Subse-<BR>quently the term meant something like “foreigner”, but that was<BR>after most of the Ānavas had become assimilated.^336 When not<BR>used in association with the foreigners the word Mleccha is<BR>used for one who is impure, dirty or uncultured. It is derived<BR>from the root §mlich~mlech,^337 meaning to speak indistinctly<BR>(like a foreigner or barbarian who does not speak Sanskrit).<BR>We find the use of root in Mahābhāṣya.^338<BR>The Sanskrit term Mleccha, referring to the indistinct<BR>speech of some non-Āryans, is taken from proto-Bodish (proto-<BR>Tibetan) mltśe “tongue”, Old Bodish ltśe, Kukish generally<BR>mlei, the combination of initial consonants (mltś — ) being<BR>simplified in various ways in different Tibeto-Burmic languages.<BR>Aspiration cannot occur after I in old Bodish; and the proto-<BR>Bodish form may have been mltse for all we know, so the ‘cch’<BR>of Sanskrit “Mleccha may come nearer the primitive affricate<BR>than anything preserved in the Tibeto-Burmic languages.<BR>Since ‘mleche’ would be an impossible combination in Sanskrit,<BR>mleccha would be as close as a Sanskrit speaker could come to<BR>it”.^339<BR>Mleccha^340 occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa^341 in the<BR>sense of a barbarian in speech. Here the brāhmaṇas are for-<BR>bidden to use barbarian speech. The example^342 given of such<BR>speech is “he' layo”, explained by Sāyaṇa as “he' rayaḥ”, “ho,<BR>foes”. The barbarians referred to were Āryan speakers, though<BR>not speakers of Sanskrit, but of a Prakrit form of speech.^343<BR>An ancient tradition regards the Andhras, Pulindas and<BR>Śabaras as dog-eaters or Mlecchas.^344 The Jain Prajñāpanā<BR>records two divisions of the people of India — Milikkha and<BR>Ārya, and enumerates 53 people in the former group, some of<BR>which are the Saga, Javana, Sabara, Vavvara, Hoṇa, Romaya,<BR>Pārasa and Khasa.^345<BR>The Mahābhārata^346 states that the Mlecchas dwelt in the<BR>Yavana, Cīna and Kamboja countries. In a dual between<BR>Karṇa and Śalya, Karṇa highly condemns the people of the<BR>Vāhīka and especially of the Madra Country and describes<BR>them as the Mleccha, the dirt among the human beings.^347<BR>They belong to unpious countries and are totally ignorant<BR>about the Dharma (righteous conduct).^348 At another place,<BR>it is stated that the Yavanas are the Mlecchas, though they<BR>follow their own ways (i. e. not following the Vedic Orthodoxy)<BR>yet they are full of knowledge and brave but the Vāhīkas and<BR>the Madras are condemned as utterly foolish.^349 This makes it<BR>clear that the people not following the righteous conduct<BR>according to the Āryan beliefs, whether indigenous or foreign,<BR>were labelled as the Mlecchas. The Mahābhārata^350 shows that<BR>the coastal regions were the favourite resort of the Mlecchas<BR>and that they were dreadful. The Epic describes the Mlecchas<BR>as being impure because they were of bovine extraction and<BR>describes them as fierce and cruel.^351<BR>In the Manu-Smṛti^352 the king is advised to exclude at<BR>deliberation time, the foolish, dumb, blind, and deaf, birds,<BR>the aged, women; the Mlecchas (the impure), diseased and<BR>deformed. At another place in the Manu-Smṛti where the girls<BR>bearing the names after a star, a tree, (or) a river, one called<BR>after the Antyas or a mountain, one called after a bird, snake,<BR>or slave or with a terrifying name are forbidden for marriage,<BR>Kullūka, the commentator on Manu explains the word Antya as<BR>representing the Mlecchas.^353 From the Manu^354 it is clear<BR>that the Mlecchas spoke a different language than the Āryans.<BR>The Vāyu, Matsya and Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇas state that the<BR>seven Himalayan rivers pass through the Mleccha countries.^355<BR>In the Varāha Purāṇa, a place named Lohārgala is stated to be<BR>ruled over by the Mleccha kings.^356<BR>The Amara-kośa^357 describes the Kirātas, Śabaras and<BR>Pulindas as the Mlecchajātis.

14. Muruṇḍas (No. 1, L. 23):<BR>Muruṇḍa is mentioned in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of<BR>Samudragupta along with the terms Daivaputra, Ṣāhi Ṣāhān-<BR>uṣāhi and Śaka as one compound expression.^371 Fleet takes<BR>Śakas and Muruṇḍas as two separate tribes. They were one of<BR>the foreign potentates who came of their own accord to offer<BR>allegiance to Samudragupta.<BR>According to Sten Konow ‘muruṇḍa’ is the later form of<BR>a Śaka word meaning ‘lord’ or ‘master’. The term ‘Śaka-<BR>Muruṇḍa’ therefore possibly stands for those Śaka lords or<BR>chieftains who were ruling in the regions of Surāṣṭra and<BR>Ujjain at the time of Samudragupta.^372<BR>But we find in the Khoh plates of Mahārāja Sarvanātha<BR>the names ‘Muruṇḍadevī’^373 and Muruṇḍasvāminī^374 which<BR>shows that Muruṇḍa was the name of a tribe and not a title.<BR>On the basis of Khoh plates, Smith^375 suggested that “the<BR>Muruṇḍas may possibly have been settled in the hill country of<BR>Riwa along the Kaimur range or more probably further south<BR>in the Vindhya or north Dekkan or possibly in the Chhota-<BR>nagpur”.<BR>According to R.K. Mookerji,^376 the people called here as<BR>the Muruṇḍas are to be distinguished from the Śakas and may<BR>be identified with the Kuṣāṇas, as earlier suggested by Sten<BR>Konow.^377<BR>We know that the term Daivaputra in the inscription has<BR>been used to refer to the Kuṣāṇa kings, and Śakas are men-<BR>tioned separately. So we cannot equate Muruṇḍas with the<BR>Kuṣāṇas as suggested by R.K. Mookerji.<BR>Some scholars regard Muruṇḍa as the name of a powerful<BR>foreign tribe, ruling in the upper Ganges valley.^378 According<BR>to the Chinese authority, the Capital of Meou-lun (a word<BR>equated with Muruṇḍa) was 7,000 li from the mouth of the<BR>Great River, which was undoubtedly the Ganges. Allan is,<BR>therefore, not right in suggesting that the Chinese description<BR>of the capital refers to Pāṭaliputra.^379 Jayaswal took Śaka-<BR>Muruṇḍa to denote the smaller Śaka rulers like the ‘Shalada,<BR>Shaka and the Gadahara chiefs as well as the Western<BR>Satraps’.^380<BR>In the Abhidhāna-Cintāmaṇi^381 and the Vaijayantī^382 the<BR>Lampākas are identified with Muruṇḍas. The Lampākas are<BR>the same as the Lambatai of Ptolemy.^383 The Purāṇas,^384<BR>mention Lampākas, the people who were residing in Lampāka,<BR>the modern Laghman in Afghanistan. Rājaśekhara seems to be<BR>referring to Lampāka as Limpaka.^385<BR>The Muruṇḍas seem to be a foreign tribe. Muruṇḍa is<BR>clearly a non-Āryan word and can have no Āryan derivation.^386<BR>Ptolemy (2nd century A.D.) mentions the Muruṇḍas for the<BR>first time under the name Moroundai and places them on the<BR>western border of the ‘Gangaridai’. They seem to have occu-<BR>pied an extensive territory, probably the whole of North-Bihar<BR>on the east of the Gaṅgā, as far as the head of the delta. They<BR>had six important cities, all to the east of the Gaṅgā: Boraita,<BR>Koryagaza, Kondota, Kelydna, Aganegora and Talarga. These<BR>places are difficult to identify but to Saint-Martin Kelydna<BR>appeared to have some relation with Kālinadī or Kālindī river,<BR>and Aganagora with Aghadip (Agradvīpa) on the eastern bank<BR>of the Ganges, a little below Katwa.^387<BR>According to Cunningham, the name of the Marundai is<BR>still preserved in the country of the Muṇḍas, a hill tribe<BR>scattered over Chhota-Nagpur and Central India.^388 But M.S.<BR>Pandey^389 opposes the view on the ground that the Muruṇḍas<BR>dwelt in the north-west with other foreign tribes. The evidence<BR>is strong enough to show that the Muruṇḍas had not spread so<BR>far to the east as to occupy the Chhota-Nagpur region. How-<BR>ever, barbarous and pastoral the Muruṇḍas might have been<BR>before their immigration into India, when they held the sceptre<BR>in their hands they must have been endowed with the quality<BR>and capacity to rule over a people who were highly civilized.<BR>Such a race could hardly have sunk to a position so low as<BR>that of the Muṇḍas of the modern times. Moreover, the<BR>Muṇḍas are a dominant division of the aboriginals of the<BR>Chhota-Nagpur region. Had they been the descendants of the<BR>Muruṇḍas, we should have found them in other parts of<BR>Central India also, and not confined to this small region so far<BR>from their place of origin.^390<BR>M.S. Pandey^391 disagrees with the Puranic account on the<BR>basis that many discrepancies have crept in owing to the mis-<BR>takes of the copyists.<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=152&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=327" target="_blank">Correction</a>

16. Puṣyamitras (No. 13, L. 11):<BR>The Bhitari Stone Pillar Inscription^397 records Skandagupta's<BR>victory over a powerful enemy called the Puṣyamitras, who<BR>possessed a strong army and a rich treasury: he (Skandagupta)<BR>placed (his) left foot on a foot-stool which was the king (of<BR>that tribe himself).^398 H.R. Divekar suggested the reading<BR>Yudhy-amitrān in place of Puṣyamitrān. But, as pointed out by<BR>R.D. Banerji,^399 the proposed reading is impossible.<BR>There are several views about the identification of the<BR>Puṣyamitras.<BR>(i) Fleet identified them with the people mentioned in the<BR>Purāṇas as Paṭumitras and located them on the<BR>Narmadā.^400<BR>(ii) V.A. Smith^401 regarded them as a people of the North.<BR>(iii) Hoernle believed that they were the same as the<BR>Maitrakas.^402<BR>(iv) R.D. Banerji^403 regarded them as the first wave of the<BR>Hūṇas.<BR>(v) N.K. Bhattasali has suggested that the Puṣyamitras<BR>were the descendants of king Puṣyavarmā of Assam.^404<BR>Bhattasali says that a pun (śleṣa) has been used for “the<BR>descendants of Puṣyavarman of Assam who had so long been<BR>mitras or friends of the Guptas, but had change into foes by<BR>their desire for conquest and had invaded the Gupta empire from<BR>the east and made it totter”. But as remarked by D.C. Sircar,<BR>“there is no grammatical, lexicographical, or literary support,<BR>for this interpretation of the name Puṣyamitra”.^405<BR>Bhattasali opines that Mahendravarman, whom he assigns<BR>to the period A.D. 450 to 490 who performed two horse-sacri-<BR>fices must have been powerful enough to launch an attack on<BR>the Gupta empire in the reign of Skandagupta.<BR>We know that the definite limits of Skandagupta's reign<BR>are from A.D. 455 to 467. The period of the rule of<BR>Mahendravarman, however, cannot be so definitely fixed because<BR>we do not possess any dated records of his reign. As a matter<BR>of fact the entire chronology of the kings of Assam can be<BR>settled approximately only by means of synchronisms and rough<BR>calculations. The attack on the Gupta empire by the Varmans<BR>of Assam in the reign of Skandagupta is an impossibility.^406<BR>The Puṣyamitras cannot be a branch of the Hūṇas as held by<BR>R.D. Banerji. The Hūṇas have been mentioned separately in<BR>the Bhitari Inscription.^407 “By whose (Skandagupta's) two<BR>arms the earth was shaken, when he, the creator (of a distur-<BR>bance like that) of a terrible whirlpool, joined in close conflict<BR>with the Hūṇas”. Hoernle's view that “the Puṣyamitras were the<BR>same as Maitrakas who some years later under the leadership<BR>of Bhaṭārka established themselves in Valabhī probably with<BR>the help of the Hūṇa ruler Toramāṇa”;^408 is also not accept-<BR>able as the Maitrakas remained subservient to the Imperial<BR>Guptas from the time of Bhaṭārka to that of Droṇasiṃha.^409<BR>Therefore, they cannot be the same as Puṣyamitras who rebelled<BR>against Skandagupta.<BR>The Purāṇas mention a people called Puṣyamitras, whose<BR>rule commenced after the end of the dynasty of the Vindhyakas.<BR>In the Viṣṇupurāṇa MSS. consulted by Prof. Wilson we have<BR>the following statement: “and Puṣpamitras, and Paṭumitras<BR>and others to the number of thirteen will rule over Mekalā”.^410<BR>Prof. Wilson has added the following note, “It seems most<BR>correct to separate the thirteen sons or families of the Vindhya<BR>princes from these Bāhlikas and then from the Puṣyamitras and<BR>Paṭumitras who governed Mekalā, a country on the Nar-<BR>madā”.^411<BR>A similar statement is to be found in the Vāyupurāṇa,<BR>according to which ‘the Puṣyamitras and Paṭumitras are<BR>grouped with the rulers of Mekalā, whose seven kings have not<BR>been named.^412<BR>The mention of Vindhyakas, evidently a people of the<BR>Vindhya region, and of Mekalā, points to the south rather than<BR>to North. So the view of V.A. Smith that the Puṣyamitras were<BR>a people of the North is not acceptable.<BR>Thus the view of Fleet that the Puṣyamitras are to be placed<BR>in Central India somewhere in the country along the banks of<BR>the Narmadā, seems to be most reasonable.^413 This is supported<BR>by numismatic evidence, a hoard of coins brought to light by<BR>D.B. Diskalkar,^414 from the village of Bamnala, 24 miles to<BR>the south of the Narmadā, indicates that there was a serious<BR>disturbance of peace in the vicinity of Mekalā, in the middle<BR>of the fifth century A.D. and we may connect it with the rising<BR>of the Puṣyamitras in that region.^415<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=155&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=329" target="_blank">Correction</a>

But they were different from the Pārasīkas. The<BR>Sassanians had founded a powerful kingdom in Persia, but they<BR>had not yet conquered the whole of Persia.^422 The Pārasīkas<BR>of Kālidāsa were the Ṣāhis.^423 Though the possibility of a<BR>Kuṣāṇa-Sassanian coalition may not be ruled out it seems that<BR>at the time of Samudragupta,^424 three kings the Daivaputra (the<BR>Kuṣāṇas), the Ṣāhi (the Persians or the Pārasīkas of Kālidāsa),<BR>and the Ṣāhānuṣāhi (the Sassanians) were ruling indepen-<BR>dently.^425<BR>Buddha Prakash^426 traces the Khatri sub-castes Sahni and<BR>Osahan as the remnants of the title ‘Ṣāhānuṣāhi’.

19. Saiṃhalaka (No. 1, L. 23):<BR>Inhabitants of Siṃhala or Ceylon. They are mentioned along<BR>with the Daivaputras, Ṣāhis, Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas and Muruṇḍas,<BR>and all (other) dwellers in islands (probably the islands of<BR>Southern Sea such as Jāvā and Sumātrā)^434 who paid homage<BR>to Samudragupta by offering themselves for services, bringing<BR>presents of maidens, praying for charters bearing the imperial<BR>Gupta Garuḍa seal (Garutmadaṅka) by which they would be<BR>left undisturbed by the emperor in the enjoyment (bhukti) and<BR>administration (śāsana) of their respective territories.^435 If<BR>literally interpreted the inscription will suggest that the people<BR>mentioned here were really tributaries under Samudragupta.<BR>When we see from the inscription itself that the Tamil states<BR>were left undisturbed, the inclusion of even distant Siṃhala<BR>(Ceylon) and all other islands in this category raises great<BR>doubts about this interpretation, and we shall hardly be justi-<BR>fied in taking the words of the Court-poet in their literal sense<BR>without corroborative evidence.^436 But the question arises that<BR>was the conquest of Tāmraparṇī (Siṃhala) by Aśoka in his<BR>Rock Edict II also a simple boast of this kind?^437<BR>So far as Ceylon is concerned, we have fortunately an<BR>independent evidence of its political relation with Samuda-<BR>gupta.<BR>We know that after the death of king Mahāsena (A.D. 334 — 62)<BR>of the Lambakarṇa clan his son Sumeghavarṇa (chi-mi-kia-<BR>po-mo = “cloud of merit”) became king of Ceylon who was a<BR>contemporary of Samudragupta (San-meou-to-lo-kin-to).^438 He,<BR>according to a Chinese text, sent two monks to Bodh-Gayā to<BR>visit the sacred spots, but they were put to great inconvenience<BR>for want of suitable accommodation. To remove this difficulty<BR>for future pilgrims to the holy place, Meghavarṇa decided to<BR>found a monastery there. He accordingly sent a mission to<BR>Samudragupta with rich presents and asked for permission,<BR>and the Ceylonese king built a splendid monastery to the north<BR>of the Bodhi tree.^439<BR>By the time of Hiuen Tsang it had developed into a magni-<BR>ficant establishment, with more than 1,000 priests, and the<BR>pilgrim has described the rich decorations and massive grand-<BR>eur of the buildings. Referring to the old history of its<BR>foundation Hiuen Tsang says that the Ceylonese king ‘gave in<BR>tribute to the king of India all the jewels of his country’. “It<BR>is likely that Samudragupta's courtier also regarded the rich<BR>presents as a tribute, and construed the Ceylonese king's<BR>prayer for permission to build a monastery into an ‘application<BR>for charter confirming him in the enjoyment of his territories’,<BR>one of the forms of homage paid by the category of states into<BR>which Siṃhala is included”.^440<BR>Siṃhala is generally identified with Laṅkā. But Varāhami-<BR>hira^441 mentions both of them separately as situated in the<BR>South.<BR>Laṅkā has been identified differently by various scholars<BR>with Laṅkā of Madhyadeśa,^442 with Maldives,^443 with the<BR>northern part of the Andhra country on the shores of the Bay<BR>of Bengal,^444 and with an island off the south-east Coast of Cey-<BR>lon.^445 All these theories are refuted by S.B. Chaudhuri^446 who<BR>remarks that the assumption that Laṅkā is not Ceylon is gra-<BR>tuitous.^447 He points out that in the Rāmāyaṇa Rāvaṇa while<BR>entreating Sītā to be his wife says: “Laṅkānāma samudrasya<BR>madhye mama mahāpurī sāgareṇa parikṣiptā niviṣṭā... ”^448<BR>Hanuman makes a similar statement in describing the strategi-<BR>cal position of Laṅkā: Sthitā pāre samudrasya dūrapārasya.^449<BR>Kālidāsa in his Raghuvaṃśa in connexion with ‘Purīm Laṅkām’<BR>writes: “Mahārṇava parikṣepam lankāyāḥ parikhālaghum”.^450<BR>With regard to the bridge built by Rāma Kālidāsa notes: sa<BR>setuṃ bandhayāmāsa plavaṅgairlavaṇāmbhasi.^451 In the Skanda<BR>Purāṇa^452 and in the Kathāsaritsāgara, we have similar references<BR>to Laṇkā.^453 All these passages point distinctly to the great sea<BR>on the other side of which was situated the great city of Laṅkā.<BR>The separate mention of Siṃhala and Laṅkā in many<BR>Sanskrit texts is quoted to show that Laṅkā was distinct from<BR>Ceylon.^454 This is hardly convincing for the separate mention<BR>of Mathurā and Śūrasena, Sāketa and Kosala, Gāndhāra<BR>and Takṣaśilā, Avanti and Ujjainī, did not imply any material<BR>geographical difference as they were treated only as convertible<BR>terms in geographical texts of the Purāṇas. In the Puranic<BR>lists, Laṇkā is a territorial name and Siṃhala is an ethnic name.<BR>As the name of a city in the island of Siṃhala, Laṅkā passed<BR>off as a dvīpa, and the two names were used in the same<BR>geographical sense. A passage in the Rāmāyaṅa runs thus:<BR>“Siṃhalān barbarān mlecchān ye ca laṅkānivāsinaḥ”.^455 Hiuen<BR>Tsang also mentions Seng-ka-lo (Ceylon) which included Leug-<BR>ka (Laṅkā).^456 As pointed out by B.C. Law, the Mahāvaṃśa<BR>and its commentary show that Laṅkādvīpa (the lower portion)<BR>was one of the main divisions of the island of Ceylon.^457<BR>It is a valid presumption, therefore, that the ancient name<BR>Laṅkā referred to Ceylon.^458 We may assume further, as seems<BR>very likely, that Laṅkā was the early name of Ceylon and its<BR>literary name as well. Mention is made of Laṅkādvīpa even in<BR>medieval inscriptions.^459 The Madras museum plates of Jaṭila-<BR>varman refer to the beautiful island of Laṅkā as Ilangai.^460 Epi-<BR>graphic evidence, however, shows that Siṃhala, another name<BR>of ancient Ceylon, was equally well known. Thus the Kanhad<BR>plate of Kṛṣṇa III refers to the island of Siṃhala.^461 In another<BR>inscription the king of Siṃhala is described as waiting on the<BR>shore.^462 In other inscriptions Siṃhala is variously designated<BR>as Siṅgala-deśam,^463 Sīlam^464 and Sihala.^465 All this evidence<BR>favours the suggestion that as territorial names Siṃhala and<BR>Laṅkā were convertible terms, although the latter is also<BR>used as the name of a city. Priaulx remarks and probably,<BR>correctly, that Laṅkā was the old mythological name for<BR>Ceylon, and that later on it was supplanted by Tāmraparṇī,<BR>and subsequently when the Periplus was written, by Palaesi-<BR>mundus or Palaesimoundon which itself was transformed into<BR>Salike, Sereṇdiva derived from Pali Sihala or Sihala dīpa.^466<BR>The name Palaesimoundon is very plausibly based on “pāre<BR>samudrasya”,^467 in the description given of Laṅkā as noted<BR>above. Ptolemy's Simoundon^468 also refers to that name. But<BR>in Ptolemy's Geography the island is called Salike which<BR>responds to Siele diba of Kosmas Indicopleustes^469 both of<BR>which have their sources in Sihalam “the Pāli form of Sanskrit<BR>Siṃhala” or Ceylon. To this source may be traced its other<BR>names such as Serendib, Zeilan, Sialan,^470 the last one yielding<BR>to Ceylon. Marco Polo's Seilan^471 is a nearer approach to the<BR>modern name. Van-der-turk suggests that the name may have<BR>been derived from Sela or ‘precious stone’, hence the island<BR>was anciently called Ratnadvīpa.^472 An Arab historian called<BR>it the “Island of Rubies”. The Chinese name for the island<BR>also implies reference to gems. The name Sailān also occurs in<BR>the works of Rashiduddin, Hayton and Jordanus.^473 Al-Beruni<BR>called it Singaldīb.^474 Siṃhala is perhaps so called as once<BR>abounding in lions.^475<BR>We may note here that there are references to another<BR>Siṃhala quite different from Ceylon.^476 It was placed to the<BR>east of Marudeśa and to the south of the Kāmādri.

20. Śaka (No. 1, L. 23):<BR>One of the tribes which is said to have paid homage to<BR>Samudragupta. As we have already discussed in connexion<BR>with the Muruṇḍas, the expression, ‘Śaka-Muruṇḍa’ should<BR>not be translated to mean Śaka-lords. Following Fleet^477<BR>we may better split the expression into two distinct names,<BR>the Śakas and Muruṇḍas.<BR>The Śakas in the time of Samudragupta (4th century A.D.)<BR>must be the Śakas of Western India belonging to the Satrapal<BR>family of Caṣṭana and Rudradāman. In this period the Śaka<BR>ruler was Rudrasiṃha II and his successor Rudrasiṃha III,<BR>whose coins come up to A.D. 390, was killed by Candragupta<BR>II.^478 Other persons of that nationality were ruling in and<BR>about Sāñcī.^479<BR>The Scyths, whom Indians named as Śakas, were originally<BR>living on the borders of Bactria. A nomadic people called<BR>Yueh-Chih by the Chinese forced them to move from that<BR>place. Eventually in the beginning of the first century B.C., the<BR>Śakas moved on from Bactria to attack first the Parthians of<BR>Iran, and then the Greeks in India.^480<BR>By the middle of the Ist Century B.C. there remained only<BR>a few petty Greek chiefs in India, and the power of the Śakas<BR>reached Mathurā. The Śakas continued the earlier practice<BR>of issuing coins with bilingual legends in Greek and Prakrit.<BR>The earliest Śaka king in India was Maues (about C. 80<BR>B.C.)^481<BR>Towards the close of the first Century A.D., the Sātavāhanas<BR>were pushed out from the North-West Deccan by the invad-<BR>ing Śakas of the Kṣaharāta clan; but the Śatavāhanas under<BR>the greatest of their rulers, Gautamīputra Śātakarṇin recover-<BR>ed their lands about A.D. 130. After this event nothing more<BR>is heard of the Kṣaharātas.^482<BR>Another Śaka dynasty, called the Kārddamaka family but<BR>generally known as the “Western Satraps”, gained control of<BR>Kathiawar and Malwa at about the same time, and ruled<BR>roughly upto A.D. 400, and at the height of their power govern-<BR>ing much of Rajasthan and Sind also. The greatest ruler of<BR>this dynasty was Rudradāman, who has left the earliest impor-<BR>tant inscription in correct Sanskrit,^483 a long panegyric which<BR>records his martial exploits, and his reconstruction of a great<BR>artificial lake at Girnar in Kathiawar, which had been excava-<BR>ted under Candragupta and improved in the time of Aśoka.<BR>This inscription is among the earliest certainly dated records<BR>of ancient India, and proves that Rudradāman was reigning in<BR>A.D. 150.^484<BR>Samudragupta's main effort was in the direction of the<BR>West, where the Śakas had ruled for over 200 years and which<BR>was enriched by the lucrative western trade. The Śakas at<BR>that time controlled Malwa and Kathiawar and were a power<BR>to be reckoned with. ‘Though the Allahabad Pillar Inscription<BR>claims that Samudragupta received homage from “the Śaka<BR>lords”, it is probable that he did not measure swords with<BR>them’.^485 It is clear that the Śaka homage to Samudragupta<BR>was not at all sincere and reliable since it was not tendered<BR>to his successor,^486 and Candragupta II had to conquer the<BR>Śakas once again.<BR>There is indeed a tradition that on the death of Samudra-<BR>gupta the Śakas succeeded in shaking the Gupta Empire, and<BR>forced the weak king, Rāmagupta, to conclude a dishonour-<BR>able peace.^487 Most authorities reject the story, and deny the<BR>historicity of Rāmagupta, but the recent discovery of copper<BR>coins bearing his name^488 strengthens the suggestion that<BR>the tradition has a basis of fact.^489<BR>It was Candragupta II (C. 376-415), the son of Samudra-<BR>gupta and younger brother of the shadowy Rāmagupta, who<BR>finally defeated the Śakas, soon after A.D. 388^490 So he is<BR>rightly remembered as ‘Śakāri’ ‘the enemy of the Śakas’.^491<BR>The trousers were introduced into India by the Śakas and<BR>seem to have been in vogue among the ruling classes during<BR>the Gupta times, for Gupta kings often appear on their coins<BR>as wearing trousers.^492<BR>The Śakas were notorious drinkers. It is said that Cyrus<BR>defeated the Śakas, when they were maddened by wine.^493<BR>It has been suggested by Buddha Prakash that as a result of<BR>the influence of the Śakas, the vogue for excessive drinking<BR>spread. Strabo^494 speaks of a Bacchanalian festival of the<BR>Persian, in which men and women, dressed in Scythian style<BR>passed day and night in drinking and wanton play.^495 We<BR>know of similar drinking bouts in the Mahābhārata.^496 Prob-<BR>ably the Scythians and the Iranians popularised drinking in<BR>the Punjab. The people of the Gangetic country, sticking to<BR>pristine ideals of moderation did not relish the exotic drink-<BR>ing bouts popularised in the Punjab, under Śaka and Persian<BR>influence. Baudhāyana in his Dharmasūtra, Karṇa in the<BR>Mahābhārata, and the Buddha in his discourses denounced<BR>drinking and laid down a prohibition against it.^497 But all<BR>this is not agreeable since Buddha and Baudhāyana belong to a<BR>period before the coming of the Śakas. Āryans have been<BR>great lovers of drinking. We can find sufficient evidence for<BR>the drinking before Śakas.<BR>We may here refer to the Śaka Era (A.D. 78), which is<BR>very popular in India even to-day. Traditionally this era is<BR>known to have been founded by a Śaka king who occupied<BR>Ujjayinī 137 years after Vikramāditya. The era may in fact<BR>have been founded by Kaniṣka. It was certainly used early in<BR>the 2nd Centuary A.D. by the “Western Satraps”, who ruled<BR>Malwa, Kathiawar and Gujarat. Thence, the use of the era<BR>spread through the Deccan and was exported to South-East<BR>Asia.^498 Because of its long association with the Śaka Satraps<BR>the era may have earned its present name.<BR>The Śakas came to be included in the category of the mart-<BR>ial classes of ancient India. Manu^499 refers to the warlike<BR>people on the fringes of Āryan civilization, including the<BR>Greeks (Yavana), the Scyths (Śaka), and the Parthians (Pah-<BR>lava), as kṣatriyas who had fallen from grace through their<BR>neglect of the sacred law, but who could be received once more<BR>into Āryan fold by adopting the orthodox way of life and<BR>performing appropriate penitential sacrifices.^500<BR>The Śakas were a white-skinned tribe or race of people; in<BR>the legends which relate the contests between Vasiṣṭha and<BR>Viśvāmitra, the Śakas are fabled to have been produced by<BR>the cow of Vasiṣṭha, from her sweat, for the destruction of<BR>Viśvāmitra's army.^501<BR>Buddha Prakash^502 traces the Śaka invasion on the basis<BR>of literary and linguistic considerations.<BR>The name of the capital of the Madras, Śākala, and that of<BR>the region between the Ravi and the Chenab, Śākaladvīpa, are<BR>based on the word Śaka and are indicative of a Śaka invasion.<BR>Likewise, the name of the clan Śākya, to which Buddha<BR>belonged, enshrines a reminiscence of the word Śaka.<BR>Moreover, the place-names ending in kanthā existing in the<BR>whole of the Punjab from the Bannu valley to the Kankhala<BR>region and even beyond suggest an intrusion of the Śakas long<BR>before the time of Pāṇini,^503 who is known to have flourished<BR>one century before the invasion of Alexander, the Great.<BR>Kanthā is a Śaka word for city^504 and is akin to kadhāvara or<BR>kanthāvara of Kharoṣṭhī inscriptions, Kand of Persian, Kanthā<BR>of Khotanese, Kandh of Sogdian, Kandai of Pushto, Kanda<BR>or Koent of the dialect of the Ṛṣikas. It is significant<BR>that the land beyond the Oxus, the Urheimat of the Śakas,<BR>abounds in Kanthā-ending place names, such as Samarkand,<BR>Khokand, Chimkand, Tashkand, Panjkand, and Yarkand.<BR>The reference to the stepped-well, called Śakandhu after<BR>the Śakas, together with that worked by Persian Wheel, known<BR>as Karkandhu after the Karkians, in a vārttika of Katyāyana^505<BR>also leads to the same conclusion.<BR>At the time of Alexander's invasion the Śakas lived at the<BR>north-western borders of India. That this tide of Śaka inva-<BR>sion, descending from the north-west, touched the eastern<BR>extremity of India, is manifest from the traditions of the<BR>Purāṇas that the Śakas advanced to Ayodhyā during the reign<BR>of King Bāhu and that his son Sagara checked and repelled<BR>them.^506<BR>In the Mahābhārata the Śakas are stated to have constitut-<BR>ed along with Cūlikas, Tuṣāras and Yavanas, the right wing<BR>of the Krauñcavyūha formed by Bhīṣma on the sixth day of<BR>the battle. ^507 Caraka in his medical treatise^508 refers to them<BR>in the context of Central Asiatic tribes, viz. Bāhlika, Pahlava,<BR>Cīna, Yavana and Śaka.^509<BR>Buddha Prakash also tries to trace the remnants of the<BR>Śakas in modern times.^510<BR>The Śakas came into Punjab after the Yavanas or the<BR>Greeks. During their long rule they contributed a great deal<BR>to Indian culture and ultimately became one with the Indian<BR>people.^511 The depth of their influence on Indian society is<BR>manifest from the word thakura, which implies the ideas of<BR>nobility and divinity and stands for the Rajputs in the Punjab<BR>and is derived from the word thagora, taugara or tukhara.^512<BR>The name Tukhāra itself survives in the name of the Tokhi<BR>caste found in the North-West.^513 Another caste called Khosla<BR>is a survival of Kusulaka, the surname of the Kṣaharāta<BR>chiefs Liaka Kusulaka and his son Patika Kusuluka. Analogous<BR>to this word is the name of Kuzula Kadphises the first Kuṣāṇa<BR>emperor to advance towards the Punjab. Hultzsch has equated<BR>this word with Turki güjlü meaning ‘strong’, and Sten Konow<BR>has compared it with Turki guzel, meaning ‘beautiful’, but<BR>Lüders has shown that it is the name of a family or clan of<BR>the Śakas.^514 So the name of Khosla is a remnant of this<BR>tribe.^515 Besides the Thakuras and Tokhis of the Punjab,<BR>there are caste-groups of Soi and Sikka, which are reminiscent<BR>of the Śakas.<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=161&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=333" target="_blank">Correction</a>

21. Sanakānīka (No. 1, L. 22; No. 3, L. 2):<BR>In Inscription No. 3 it occurs with the short ‘i’ in the fourth<BR>syllable, i. e. as ‘Sanakānika’.^516<BR>The Sanakānīkas were also subjugated by Samudragupta<BR>along with other tribes who payed him all kinds of taxes,<BR>obeyed his orders and were coming to perform obeisance.^517<BR>In the Udayagiri Cave Inscription of Candragupta II, of the<BR>Year 82 (A.D. 401) (No. 3), we know of a Mahārāja of the<BR>‘Sanakānīka’ tribe or family, who was a feudatory of Candra-<BR>gupta II and who is stated to have recorded his gift on a Vaiṣ-<BR>ṇava Cave temple at Udayagiri.^518 Udayagiri is a well-known<BR>hill about two miles to the north-west of Bhilsa, ancient<BR>Vidiśā.^519 Thus we can say that the Sanakānīkas lived in the<BR>neighbourhood of Bhilsa.^520 D.R. Bhandarkar mentions them<BR>to have held the province of Vidiśā but he also locates Gaṇa-<BR>patināga's kingdom (one of the kings subjugated by Samudra-<BR>gupta) in Vidiśā.^521 So his view seems to be inconsistent.<BR>It may be noted that the Sanakānīka feudatory chief of<BR>Candragupta II, as well as his father and grandfather, bore the<BR>title Mahārāja. This may suggest that the Sanakānīkas, and<BR>probably other tribes mentioned along with them in the<BR>Allahabad Pillar Inscription were not tribal republics, as is<BR>generally supposed, but were ruled by hereditary chiefs.^522<BR>The name of the grandfather of this Sanakānīka feudatory<BR>chief of Candragupta II, is given as Chagalaga ‘which looks<BR>like a foreign name’;^523 but his father bears a purely Hindu<BR>name: ‘Viṣṇudāsa’. Of course the present chief's name is<BR>illegible in the inscription (No. 3).^524 But considering the trend<BR>it may be surmised that his name also was a Sanskrit name.^525<BR>It seems that the tribe which originally consisted of aboriginal<BR>people was gradually coming under the influence of Sanskrit<BR>culture.<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=166&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=334" target="_blank">Correction</a>

वाह्लिक
22. Vāhlika (No. 20, L. 2):<BR>The Meharaulī Pillar Inscription (No. 20) describes the dig-<BR>vijaya of a king named Candra (i. e. Candragupta II) in the<BR>first verse as stated below: “He, on whose arm fame was<BR>inscribed by the sword, when, in battle in the Vaṅga count-<BR>ries, he kneaded (and turned) back with (his) breast the enemi-<BR>es who, uniting together, came against him; — he, by whom,<BR>having crossed in warfare the seven mouths of the (river)<BR>Sindhu, the Vāhlikas were conquered; — he, by the breezes of<BR>whose prowess the Southern ocean is even still perfumed”.^526<BR>We find various readings of the name Vāhlika in literature<BR>which are: Vāhlika, Bāhlika, Vāhlīka and Bāhlīka. In our<BR>inscription (No. 20) ‘Vāhlikāḥ’, i. e. Vāhlika in plural denotes<BR>the people of Vāhlika i. e. Bactria (modern Balkh) region on<BR>the Oxus in the northern part of Afghanistan.^527<BR>Mislead by a verse in the Rāmāyaṇa,^528 D.R. Bhandarkar^529<BR>places Vāhlikas in the close proximity of the Vipāśā, the<BR>modern Beas. The reading Vāhlīkān in the passage quoted<BR>from the Rāmāyaṇa is a mistake for Vāhīkān. Numerous<BR>passages can be quoted from the Epic, Puranic and classical<BR>Sanskrit literature to prove that the Punjab = Pañcanada, ‘the<BR>land of five rivers’, was in ancient times called the Vāhīka<BR>country.^530<BR>‘Vāhīka’ was, in fact, a general term for the whole of<BR>Punjab. We know Śākala as Vāhīka-grāma from Patañjali and<BR>also Pātanaprastha which is modern Pathankot by the same<BR>term. Moreover, Vatsyāyana in his Kāmasūtra and Rajaśekhara<BR>in his Kāvya-mīmāṃsā mention the people of Bāhlīka and<BR>Punjab as two separate entities. ^531<BR>There is, however, one verse in the Karṇaparvan of the<BR>Mahābhārata which suggests that Vāhīka was originally the<BR>name of a country or people on the Vipāśā, (the Beas): “In<BR>the Vipāśā, there were two Piśācas named Vahi and Hika;<BR>their descendants are called Vāhīkas who are not the creation<BR>of Prajāpati”.^532<BR>Later on the sense of the word expanded to cover all the<BR>tribes living in the Punjab. It is interesting to note that the<BR>Māhābhārata sometimes uses the terms Vāhīka, Madra, Jartika,<BR>Āraṭṭa and Pañcanada synonymously. It appears that the lands<BR>of these tribes which lived close to one another became in<BR>course of time moulded into a big kingdom under the powerful<BR>kings of Śākala (Sialkot). As Vāhīka was beyond Kurukshetra<BR>and, therefore, outside the boundary of Brahmāvarta, its ana-<BR>logical connection with the word ‘bahis’ may have been another<BR>cause of the expansion of its geographical sense.^533 This is<BR>also reflected in the Vārttikas of Katyāyana who derives the<BR>word ‘Vāhīka’ from ‘vahis’ or ‘bahis’, meaning ‘outside’ (the<BR>pale of Āryandom).^534<BR>Some scholars^535 rely on the description of the Bāhlikas<BR>as the offspring of two Piśācas, Bahi and Hika, as given in<BR>the Mahābhārata. Buddha Prakash holds that fresh stream<BR>of the Bactrian people which swooped over the Punjab came<BR>to be known as Bālhikas; their name which became a general<BR>designation for the people of Punjab was later corrupted as<BR>Vāhīka.^536 But we have already shown that the two were<BR>separate entities.<BR>We know that the Vāhīkas were the people living within<BR>the boundaries of the five rivers including the sixth Sindhu<BR>(Indus),^537 but according to the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription<BR>Candragupta conquered Vāhlikas after crossing the seven<BR>months of the (river) Indus (sapta mukhāni sindhoḥ).^538 So<BR>Vāhlika of our inscription is certainly Balkh in the extreme<BR>north of Afghanistan.^539 Bajpai^540 opposes it on the ground<BR>that Candragupta could not have gone to so far off a place as<BR>Bactria which is situated across the Hindukush and rejects<BR>the older contention of scholars that the Kuṣāṇas were ruling<BR>in Bactria during king Candra's campaign and that he crossed<BR>the Hindukush to crush them.<BR>But the view of Bajpai is not tenable since it is clear from<BR>the lines in our inscription^541 that king Candra had conquered<BR>the Vāhlikas after crossing the seven mouths of the river<BR>Indus.<BR>So far as the literary evidence is concerned we find that<BR>Bālhika is the name of a people in the Atharvaveda;^542 here<BR>the fever (Takman) is called upon to go to the Mūjavants, the<BR>Mahāvṛṣas, and the Balhikas. The Mūjavants are quite certainly<BR>a northern tribe, and though the passage may contain a pun<BR>on Bālhika as suggesting ‘outsider’ (from bahis, ‘without’),^543<BR>still there is no doubt that the name was chosen from a northern<BR>tribe.^544<BR>The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇā^545 mentions a Kuru king named<BR>Balhika Prātipīya. It seems that Balhika was a descendant of<BR>Pratīpa. But there is no evidence to show why he bore the name<BR>Balhika.^546 He is perhaps the same as Mahārāja Bāhlika Prātī-<BR>peya of the Mahābhārata.^547<BR>The Rāmāyaṇa shows that the Royal Kuru family originally<BR>migrated from the Bāhlīka country. The passage in question^548<BR>says that Ila, son of the Prajāpati Kardama, who was the king<BR>of the Vāhli country, gave up Bahlika in favour of his son<BR>Śaśavindu, and founded a new city Pratiṣṭhānapura in the<BR>Madhya-deśa, where his other son Pururava Aila continued to<BR>rule. This links up the Ailas, the progenitor of the Kurus, with<BR>the Kardama royal family of Bāhli. H.C. Raychaudhuri^549<BR>suggests that Kārddama, the name of the ruling family of<BR>Vāhlika, was obtained from the river of that name in Persia,<BR>and thus infers that the home of the Kārddama king is to<BR>be identified with Bahlika or Balkh in Iran. This view was<BR>earlier advocated by Roth^550 and Weber.^551 But Zimmer^552<BR>rightly shows that there is no need to assume any Iranian<BR>influence.^553<BR>We know Vāhlīka from the Puranic list of peoples^554 The<BR>Account of fifty-six countries^555 is interesting as it mentions<BR>them with the Hūṇas, Kauravas, Gāndhāras and Vidarbhas<BR>among others. In the Śaktisaṅgama Tantra^556 Bāhlīka is<BR>described as famous for horses and situated to the east of<BR>Mahāmlechha and beginning with Kamboja. B.C. Law on the<BR>basis of reference in the Mahābhārata^557 places the Vāhlikas<BR>in the neighbourhood of Gandhar and Kamboja.^558<BR>Katyāyana (4th century B.C.)^559 mentions Bāhlāyana and<BR>derives it from the word Bāhli, a country also mentioned in<BR>the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya.^560<BR>The Vāyu Purāṇa, Śiva Purāṇā, Kāvya-Mīmāṃsā of Rājaśe-<BR>khara and the Rāmāyaṇa^561 place the Vāhlika country in the<BR>northern division.^562 Bāhlika is the name of a person in the<BR>Viṣṇu-Purāṇa.^563 The Nāṭyaśāstra^564 of Bharata says that<BR>Bāhlikabhāṣā was spoken by the northern people (Udīcyas).<BR>A similar reference is also to be found in the Sāhitya-darpaṇa.^565<BR>In the Kāmasūtra of Vatsyāyana,^566 Bāhlīka is grouped<BR>with Strīrājya, which occurs in the list of North-Western divi-<BR>sion. The peculiar custom in Bāhlika of several young men<BR>being married to a single woman as in strīrājya (strīrājye ca<BR>Bāhlike...), appears to be an outlandish custom prevailing<BR>in the regions to the west of India.^567 The Jayamaṅgalā comm-<BR>entary also says that Bāhlīka was in Uttarāpatha.^568<BR>We find the word Vāhlika occurring in the Amara-kośa in<BR>two ways:<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=167&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=335" target="_blank">Correction</a>

2. Bāhlīka^570<BR>The Amarakośa shows that Bāhlīka was famous for horses,<BR>saffron and Ferula Asafoetida (hiṅgu).<BR>The reference to saffron leads us to the filaments of saffron<BR>on the banks of Vaṅkṣu (oxus) where Raghu gave defeat to the<BR>Hūṇas as described in Kālidāsa's Raghuvaṃśa.^571 The reading<BR>Sindhu of the passage^572 is plainly a mistake for Vaṅkśu which<BR>is corroborated by Kṣīrasvāmin, the earliest commentator of<BR>Amara who clearly shows that the Bāhlīka country was border-<BR>ed on the Oxus.^573<BR>The Bṛhatsaṃhitā^574 places Bāhlīkas in the jurisdiction of<BR>the Sun. Ancient tradition connects the Bāhlikas with the<BR>Dhārṣṭakas, a Kṣatriya clan which occupied the Bāhlīka<BR>country.^575 We know that Bāhlīkī was another name of Mādrī,<BR>queen of the Madras.^576<BR>Buddha Prakash suggests that the Vedic school of the<BR>Bhāllavins enshrined the memory of the Bāhlīkas; the modern<BR>sub-castes of the Barasarin sub-group of the khatris Bhalla and<BR>Behl represent the ancient Bālhīkas, and the Jāṭ clans of Bhālār<BR>and Bhalerah, found in Multan, the Baloch tribe Bhalkā, liv-<BR>ing in Sindh, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan and the clan<BR>Bhallowana, found in Shahpur, are remnants of the far-flung<BR>Bāhlika tribes.^577 There is a possibility of the Bāhlīkas migrat-<BR>ing from their original home Balkh to the Punjab.^578<BR>When Hieun Tsang visited Balkh, it was a centre of Buddh-<BR>ist faith,^579 but after the overthrow of the Sassanid kingdom by<BR>the Arabs, the ancient Bactria along with the adjoining territor-<BR>ies passed under the control of Khorasan, the seat of the<BR>Muhammadan power.^580<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=170&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=337" target="_blank">Correction</a>

23. Yaudheya (No. 1, L. 22):<BR>The Yaudheyas are included among the tribes subjugated by<BR>Samudragupta. In his time, they seem to have occupied north-<BR>ern Rajputana and south-east Punjab, and their territory<BR>extended up to the confines of the Bahawalpur State where<BR>their name survives in the name of the tract called Johiyawar.^581<BR>Their earliest reference in the inscriptions is found in the<BR>Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradāman I (A.D. 150)^582<BR>which mentions the victory of Mahākṣatrapa Rudradāman over<BR>the Yaudheyas who were ‘proud of their heroism’. The Bijaya-<BR>gadh Inscription^583 which is a record of the Yaudheyas (in<BR>Brāhmī characters of the second-third century A.D.)^584 connects<BR>them with Bharatpur State in Rajputana. It refers to one<BR>Mahārāja Mahāsenāpati, the ruler of the Yaudheya-gaṇa.^585<BR>Literally the word Yaudheya means ‘a warrior’ which corr-<BR>esponds with the Ossadü of Arrian, the Sambastae of Diodorus<BR>and the Sambracae of Curtius, who made their submission to<BR>Alexander.^586 They were a powerful nation and their forces<BR>consisted of 60,000 foot, 6000 horse, and 500 chariots.^587<BR>We get three different versions about the origin of the<BR>Yaudheyas:<BR>(i) In the Mahābhārata^588 it is stated that Yudhiṣṭhira<BR>married the daughter of the Śaivya King Govāsana<BR>named Devikā and begot a son from her named<BR>Yaudheya.<BR>Buddha Prakash^589 and M.K. Sharan,^590 on this basis,<BR>have been tempted to connect the Yaudheyas with<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira, the eldest of the Pāṇḍava brothers. D.K.<BR>Gupta questions the foundations of this theory on this<BR>solitary basis in the absence of a more solid or a posi-<BR>tive evidence;^591 but on the other hand he himself has<BR>indulged in connecting the Ārjunāyanas with the epic<BR>hero Arjuna.^592<BR>(ii) The Viṣṇu-Purāṇa gives a contrary view of the same<BR>story. It states that Yaudheyī was the queen of Yudhi-<BR>ṣṭhira from whom he had a son named Devaka^593<BR>(iii) The Harivaṃśa^594 and the Vāyu Purāṇa^595 state that<BR>King Uśīnara of the Puru dynasty had five queens<BR>named Nṛgā or Mṛgā, Kṛmī, Navā, Darvā and Dṛṣad-<BR>vatī who gave birth to five sons named Nṛga, (or Mṛga),<BR>Kṛmi, Nava, Suvrata and Śibi (or Śivi) respectively.<BR>Śibi was the lord of the Śibi people or of the city of<BR>Śivapura, while Nṛga (or Mṛga) was the ruler of the<BR>Yodheyas or of Yaudheyapura. The other three sons<BR>of Uśīnara, viz., Nava, Kṛmi and Suvrata, were the<BR>lords respectively of Navarāṣṭra, Kṛmilāpurī and Amba-<BR>ṣṭhapurī.^596 According to Pargiter, King Uśinara<BR>established the Yaudheyas, Ambaṣṭhas, Navarāṣṭra, and<BR>the city of Kṛmilā, all on the eastern border of the<BR>Punjab; while his famous son Śivi Auśīnara originated<BR>the Śivis or Śrbis in Sivapura.^597<BR>It is very difficult to reject or accept the Puranic tradition<BR>without any further evidence. However, as regards their conne-<BR>ction with Uśīnara, we may say that scholars are somewhat<BR>confused by differing versions by varied text with regard to the<BR>territory ruled over by him.^598 The Ṛgveda, the Jātakas as<BR>well as the accounts of Fahien and Hiuen Tsang connect the<BR>Uśīnaras with a region farther to the north-west in Swat Valley,<BR>a part of the ancient Mahājanapada of Gandhāra; while the<BR>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, the Kauśītakī Upaniṣad and the Kathāsa-<BR>ritsāgara associate them to the region north of Haridwar near<BR>the source of Ganges at Kanakhala.<BR>It is possible that originally they were settled in the Swat<BR>Valley but by the passage of time, they migrated to other places<BR>as well. For example, we find that the Śibis were known to<BR>Alexander's followers, living between the Indus and the<BR>Akesines (Chenab).^599<BR>In the Mahābhārata,^600 the Yaudheyas are described as<BR>having been defeated by Arjuna, along with the Mālavas and<BR>Trigarttas. In the Sabhāparvan,^601 the Yaudheyas together<BR>with the Śibis and the Trigarttas are represented as having<BR>paid homage to Yudhiṣṭhira. In the Droṇaparvan,^602 we find<BR>that an epithet ‘Adrija’ meaning ‘mountain-born’, is used for<BR>the Yaudheyas.<BR>The Yaudheyas were one of the republican tribes of the<BR>Punjab. Pāṇini^603 includes them among the āyudhajīvī saṃghas<BR>together with the Parśus who are considered to be Persians<BR>by Dr. Buddha Prakash.^604 Pāṇini mentions the Yaudheyas in<BR>another Sūtra also.^605 Kauṭilya also refers to the Yaudheya as<BR>a warrior clan of the Punjab.^606<BR>The Bṛhatsaṃhitā^607 places them in the northern division of<BR>India and describes them as being in the region of Bṛhaspati.^608<BR>In the Sāhityadarpaṇa of Viśvanātha, they are described as<BR>interested in gambling (dīvyatām) and speaking the Southern<BR>Vaidarbhī.^609<BR>Yaudheya coins have been found all over the area from<BR>Saharanpur to Multan. In the Ludhiana district have been<BR>unearthed their votive tablets. A rich find of their coin-moulds<BR>was brought to light by B. Sahni at Khokrakot near Rohtak<BR>where there seems to have existed a regular mint.^610 Their<BR>new currency^611 depicting their tutelary deity Kārttikeya which<BR>replaced the Kuṣāṇa currency in these regions, shows that<BR>they played a leading part in the extermination of Śaka rule<BR>in India.^612 The findings of the Yaudheya coins in large num-<BR>ber at Saharanpur, Dehradoon, Delhi, Rohtak and Kangra<BR>attest the fact that they had driven out the Kuṣāṇas from these<BR>areas and had re-established themselves firmly, in the 3rd-4th<BR>century A.D.^613<BR>One of their seals, bearing the legend “Yaudheyānām jayam-<BR>antradharāṇām”^614 shows that they were held in high esteem<BR>among the warrior-clans of the Punjab. Some scholars seem<BR>to be confused about its interpretation. Shobha Mukerji^615<BR>opines that their coins were issued in the name of the gaṇa as<BR>well as the Mantra-dharas. M.K. Sharan^616 explains the word<BR>“Mantradhara” to mean the members of the Executive Com-<BR>mittee “those vested with the policy of the state”. He is of the<BR>opinion that one set of the Yaudheya coins is struck in the<BR>name of the “Mantradharas” and the “Gaṇa”, while the other<BR>set is struck simply in the name of Gaṇa.^617 He seems to have<BR>wrongly substituted the reading “Mantradhāra” for “Mantra-<BR>dhara”. He has been arbitrary in separating “Jaya” from<BR>Mantradharāṇām”^618 which forms a compound by the combi-<BR>nation of the two words. Further he rejects the view of some<BR>historians who consider the word “Mantradharāṇām” to mean<BR>‘those who were in possession of Victory Charm’. But he<BR>contradicts himself at another place while explaining a seal^619<BR>found at Naurangabad with the remarks: “This seal indicates<BR>the bravery of the tribe and that they were never defeated as<BR>they had adopted the title of ‘जयमन्त्रधराः’”.<BR>Actually the expression may mean ‘the Yaudheyas who<BR>knew the secret of victory’. It is symbolic of their victory and<BR>pride that they never got defeated.<BR>Another word which has raised some controversy among<BR>the scholars is “Darma” found on some of the Yaudheya coins.<BR>Some scholars take it to mean Dharma while others take it for<BR>‘Dama’ or ‘Darma’ to be a Sanskritised form of Greek —<BR>“Drachma”.^620 Again some controversy arose whether it was<BR>a Copper one or of silver.^621 The word ‘Damma’ or ‘Dramma’<BR>has been used for a gold coin.^622 It may be remarked that the<BR>word borrowed from some foreign language may not strictly<BR>be used in the original sense and hence it may simply mean<BR>coin.^623 The Kuṣāṇas had introduced gold-coins which were<BR>later on adopted by the Guptas. But the Yaudheyas seem to<BR>have never adopted the gold currency since so far we have found<BR>no gold coin belonging to them. This may speak of their weaker<BR>economic condition; surely they could not compare with<BR>powerful monarchies. On some of the Yaudheya coins, we have<BR>the mysterious words, “dvi” (two) and “tri” (three) after the<BR>legend “Yaudheyagaṇasya jayaḥ” which may point out their<BR>making a confederation with other tribes, viz., the Ārjunāyanas<BR>and the Kuṇindas.^624 They seem to have controlled the area<BR>lying on the banks of the river Sutlej up to the borders of the<BR>Bahawalpur State which is still called Johiyawar. The word<BR>‘Johiya’ is apparently an abbreviation of ‘Jodhiya’, which is the<BR>Sanskrit Yaudheya.^625 Cunningham, however, takes the words<BR>‘dvi’ and ‘tri’ of the above-mentioned coins to signify ‘the<BR>money of the second and third tribes of the Yaudheyas’.^626<BR>M.K. Sharan^627 has enlisted about twenty-four types and<BR>Symbols on the coins of the Yaudheyas which may point to<BR>their religious leanings as well bear out some aspects of their<BR>social life. They are as follows:<BR>1. Bull<BR>2. Elephant<BR>3. Deer<BR>4. Peacock<BR>5. Tree-in-railing<BR>6. Human figure standing (warrior)<BR>7. Lakṣmī<BR>8. Cobra<BR>9. Scythic-like object (Yūpa)<BR>10.

राष्ट्र
 Rāṣṭra^1 (from §rāj):<BR>It is the oldest and biggest territorial term. In the Ṛgveda^2<BR>and later Saṃhitās,^3 it denotes ‘kingdom’ or ‘royal territory’.<BR>It is considered to be one of the Prakṛtis (constituents)^4 and<BR>refers to a country.^5 It was the name of a Commissioner's<BR>division under the Rāṣṭrakūṭas.^6 In South India, under the<BR>Pallavas, Kadambas, and Sālaṅkāyanas also it denotes only<BR>a district, if not a tehsil.^7 The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra^8 says<BR>that ‘all the rāṣṭra including nagara is called deśa or maṇḍala<BR>while nagara is excluded in janapada’.<BR>It divides rāṣṭras into three kinds: —<BR>(i) Big: It consists of nine thousand and ninety villages,<BR>but some scholars say that the nine thousand and sixty<BR>four villages make a big rāṣṭra.^9<BR>(ii) Middle: It consists of five thousand, three hundred and<BR>eighty four villages.^10<BR>(iii) Small: It consists of one thousand, five hundred and<BR>forty eight villages.^11<BR>It further discusses that seven cities should be established<BR>in each rāṣṭra.^12<BR>In place-names rāṣṭra is changed into:^13<BR>(a) Rāṭhā, as Mahārāṣṭra, Marāṭhā<BR>(b) Rāṭ, at Mayarāṣṭra, (= Mayarāṭ), Mirāṭ<BR>It also changes into raṭṭa,<BR>Cf.

देवराष्ट्र
1. Devarāṣṭra (No. 1, L. 20):<BR>It has been mentioned as ruled by Kubera one of the kings<BR>ruling in Southern Region who were subdued by Samudragupta.<BR>Dey^16 identifies it with the Maratha country (i. e. Mahārāṣṭra).<BR>Fleet and Smith are also of the same opinion. G. Ramdas<BR>slightly differs from them when he identifies Devarāṣṭra with<BR>modern Devagiri in the Dharwar district.^17 According to R.D.<BR>Banerjee^18 Devarāṣṭra is the name of a district or province in<BR>Kaliṅga. B.C. Law^19 identifies it with Yellowmanchili taluka of<BR>the Vizagapatam district, which is also the view of H.C. Ray-<BR>chaudhuri,^20 S.B. Chaudhuri,^21 Dubreuil and Bhandarkar.^22 This<BR>view is generally accepted at present. Earlier scholars held that<BR>Samudragupta made a round of the South crossing from the<BR>eastern to the western coast of India. But this involves serious<BR>difficulties about his potential relations with the Vākāṭakas.<BR>Now, scholars describe southern campaign of Samudragupta<BR>as confined to the eastern coast. Thus it becomes apparent<BR>that Devarāṣṭra was conterminous with Kośala (Sirpur). Tām-<BR>ralipti may have been included in Devarāṣṭra.^23<BR>2. Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa (No 28, L. 2, L. 8, L. 15):<BR>L. 2 of the inscription mentions a maṇḍala (sub-division) called<BR>Nāgiraṭṭa (Nāgiraṭṭa-māṇḍalika) and later on refers to Mūla-<BR>Nāgiraṭṭa which seems to have been the headquarters of this<BR>maṇḍala. It is clear from the inscription itself that Mūla-<BR>Nāgiraṭṭa was situated in the neighbourhood of Nitva-Gohālī.^24<BR>Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa literally means ‘Nāgiraṭṭa Proper’. The<BR>word Nāgiraṭṭa is the Prakritic form of Nāgarāṣṭra meaning ‘a<BR>country of the Nāgas’.<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=210&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=340" target="_blank">Correction</a>

सुराष्ट्र
3. Surāṣṭra (No. 14, L. 8, L. 9):<BR>In L. 8 Surāṣṭra is used in plural^25 while in L. 9 it is an adjective<BR>of avani (land).^26 In this inscription great importance has been<BR>attached to Surāṣṭra. After his conquests, Skandagupta<BR>deliberated for days and nights together as to whom should be<BR>entrusted important task of guarding the land of the Surāṣṭras.^27<BR>At last he was satisfied by appointing Parṇadatta as a governor<BR>over this western^28 region.<BR>Surāṣṭra corresponds with Southern Kathiawar with its<BR>Prakrit name Soraṭh.^29 Literally the name means a good<BR>country. It was so named probably on account of the natural<BR>fertility of the land, Soraṭh is well known for rich crops of all<BR>kinds, and splendid cattle.^30<BR>Surāṣṭra^31 is mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription<BR>of Rudradāman I (A.D. 150). It was governed by Puṣyagupta,<BR>under Candragupta Maurya and by a Yavana Tuṣāspa under<BR>Aśoka.^32 The Purāṇas^33 and the Kāvyamīmāṃsā^34 mention it<BR>a country in the west while the Bṛhatsaṃhitā^35 mentions it<BR>as a country in the South. It may be due to the different<BR>geographical units made by the authors of the Kāvyamīmāṃsā<BR>and the Bṛhatsaṃhitā.<BR>Under Gupta emperors Bāmanasthalī (modern Banthali) was<BR>the capital of Surāṣṭra, before Valabhī became its capital.^36<BR>The name Surāṣṭra also occurs in the Mahābhārata, the<BR>Jātakas^37, and several times in the Rāmāyaṇa.^38 It is also<BR>mentioned in Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya.^39 In Kauṭilya's Arthaśās-<BR>tra, Surāṣṭras are mentioned as one of the corporations of<BR>warriors who lived by agriculture and trade.^40 According to<BR>the Arthaśāstra the elephants of Surāṣṭra were inferior to those<BR>belonging to Aṅga and Kaliṅga.^41<BR>In the medieval period,^42 in three directions, Bhavanagar,<BR>Porabandar and Somanath (the famous temple) were the limits<BR>of Surāṣṭra.<BR>Place-names ending in Bhukti<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=210&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=341" target="_blank">Correction</a>

भुक्ति
 Bhukti (from §bhuj)<BR>Literally it means ‘enjoyment’ or possession.^43 Bhukti<BR>denoted an administrative division smaller than a modern<BR>Tehsil or Taluka in the Deccan and M.P., but in Northern<BR>India under the Guptas and Pratihāras it denoted a unit as<BR>large as the Commissioner's Division in modern times.^44 Thus<BR>Pratiṣṭhānabhukti consisted of only 12 and Koppārakabhukti<BR>of 50 villages in the Deccan under the Rāṣṭrakūṭas,^45 whereas<BR>under the Guptas the Puṇḍravardhanabhukti comprised of the<BR>districts of Dinajpur, Bogra and Rajshahi, and Magadhabhukti<BR>included the districts of Gayā and Pāṭaliputra.^46 Śrāvastibhukti<BR>under the Pratihāras included several districts in northern<BR>U.P.^47 The Bhuktis under the Pratihāra empire appear to have<BR>been rather Commissioners' Divisions than provinces.^48 Bhukti<BR>is changed into huti as Jejakabhukti, Jejahuti.^49 The unit bhukti<BR>which so often appears in the inscriptions of the Gupta period<BR>as the designation of an administrative unit is not frequently<BR>found in the early medieval period.^50 The mention of a<BR>Nagara-bhukti is also made in Deo-Baranark Inscription of<BR>Jīvitagupta II.^51<BR>We find only one place name with the suffix bhukti which<BR>is detailed below:<BR>Puṇḍravardhana (No. 28, L. 1; No. 33, LL. 1-2; No. 34,<BR>L. 2; No. 35, L. 2; No. 36, L. 2; No. 37, L. 2; No. 43,<BR>L. 14):<BR>This bhukti is mentioned in the Gupta epigraphs ranging<BR>from the years 124 to 224 of the Gupta era, i. e. from A.D. 443<BR>to 543. It formed an integral part of Gupta empire during this<BR>period. According to Inscription No. 37, a noble man (kula-<BR>putra) Amṛtadeva by name belonging to Ayodhyā approached<BR>the local government of Koṭivarṣa of which Svyambhudeva<BR>was the governor, under the provincial government of Puṇḍra-<BR>vardhana-bhukti, during the reign of Bhānugupta, and prayed<BR>that he might be given, by means of a copper-plate document<BR>in accordance with the prevailing custom, some rent-free<BR>waste lands. His prayer was granted.<BR>General Cunningham^52 identifies Puṇḍravardhana with the<BR>extensive ruins known as ‘Mahāsthāngarh’, 8 miles north of<BR>the town of Bogra. The river Karatoyā was the dividing line<BR>between Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti and Kāmarūpa.^53 According<BR>to Wilson, the ancient kingdom of Puṇḍradeśa included the<BR>districts of Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Malda, Bogra and<BR>Tirhut.^54 It seems to have been the biggest administrative<BR>division or province of the Gupta empire, divided into several<BR>viṣayas and maṇḍalas of which twenty-four^55 are mentioned<BR>in known epigraphs. In short Puṇḍravardhana signified North<BR>Bengal.<BR>Puṇḍravardhana, as the name suggests, was a settlement of<BR>the Puṇḍras.^56 The first reference to the Puṇḍras is found in<BR>the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.^57 The earliest literary reference to<BR>Puṇḍravardhana is to be traced in the Buddhist work, the<BR>Divyāvadāna, where it is mentioned as the easternmost city of<BR>India.^58 The Pauṇḍra country is mentioned also in the Bṛhat-<BR>saṃhitā,^59 as situated in the east.^60 The Kāvyamīṃāṃsā also<BR>mentions it as a Janapada in the east. In the inscriptions of<BR>Bengal the name Puṇḍravardhana was changed into Pauṇḍra-<BR>vardhana in the early part of the 12th century, when it occurs<BR>first in the Manahali grant of Madanapāla and remained in use<BR>till the end of the Sena rule. The Rājataraṅgiṇī mentions<BR>Puṇḍravardhana as the capital of Gauḍa which is also proved<BR>by a reference in Puruṣottama's lexicon (11th century A.D.)^61<BR>The city lost its importance from the third quarter of the<BR>12th century A.D. as the later Sena kings shifted their capital<BR>to Gauḍa in the Malda district.

विषय
 Viṣaya<BR>According to Monier Williams it means a dominion, king-<BR>dom, territory, region, district, country, or abode and in plural<BR>it meant lands or possessions.^63 In the Aṣṭādhyāyī^64 it denotes<BR>regions or provinces, called after their inhabitants, e. g. Śaiba,<BR>the region of the Śibis; Mālavaka, the region of the Mālava<BR>people; Rājanyaka, of the Rājanya tribe and so forth. ‘The<BR>names according to Viṣaya seem to be based on the ethnic<BR>distribution of population over particular areas for the time<BR>being without reference to the form of government’.^65<BR>The word Viṣaya in the sūtra Viṣayo deśe^66 is significant.<BR>Jainendra, Śākaṭāyana and Hemacandra take it as rāṣṭra, and<BR>Vardhamāna as Janapada. The Kāśikā takes it as grāma-samu-<BR>dāya. Kātayāyana and Patañjali interpret Viṣaya as being<BR>identical with janapada in some cases, but their comments<BR>give the impression that even such geographical units as were<BR>not a janapada were called Viṣaya.^67<BR>If Viṣaya and Janapada had been identical, Pāṇini would<BR>not have treated the former under a separate heading.^68 A<BR>Viṣaya denoted both a bigger unit having the status of a<BR>Janapada, and a smaller area which was but an estate. In the<BR>Rājanyādi gaṇa, viṣaya denotes janapadas, while in the<BR>Bhauriki and Aiṣukāri gaṇas,^69 it is landed property, the share<BR>of estate which was the source of livelihood.<BR>In the post-pāṇinian period, distinction between Janapada<BR>and viṣaya was lost, both being called by the same names, for<BR>example Aṅgāḥ, Vangāḥ, Sumhāḥ, and Puṇḍrāḥ. In some Jana-<BR>padas like Rājanya, the distinction was retained, as Rājanyaka<BR>denoted a viṣaya and Rājanyāḥ, the Janapada of the Rājanya<BR>tribe. Similarly we have Vāsātaḥ, Vāsātayaḥ; Gandhāraḥ,<BR>Gāndhārayaḥ; and Śaibaḥ, Śibiyaḥ. Other smaller units were<BR>only viṣayas or estates like Bailvavanaka, Ātmakāmeyaka,<BR>Bhaurikavidha and Aiṣukāri-bhakta.^70<BR>The viṣaya usually corresponded with the district of the<BR>modern administration.^71 Minor bhuktis, maṇḍalas and the<BR>viṣayas were used to denote the same administrative division<BR>in many cases.^72 The district administration was well organised<BR>in the Gupta period. Some of the land-grant charters bear the<BR>seals of the district administration.^73 Sealings of the district<BR>administration of Rājagṛha and Gayā have been found at<BR>Nālandā, showing that their correspondence to outsiders bore<BR>the impress of their official seals.^74<BR>We have the following place-names ending in Viṣaya:<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=213&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=343" target="_blank">Correction</a>

गया
1. Gayā (No. 21, L. 7):<BR>A village named Revatikā belonging to the Gayā viṣaya<BR>was granted as an agrahāra to a brāhmaṇa, ostensibly by<BR>Samudragupta.^75 Gayā is at present headquarters of the<BR>Gayā district, 60 miles due south of Patna. It comprises the<BR>modern town of Sahebganj on the northern side and the<BR>ancient town of Gayā on the southern side.^76 Much has been<BR>written on Gayā,^77 all of which is not possible to discuss<BR>here. We will confine ourselves to the origin of the name Gayā<BR>and the importance of Gayā.<BR>In the Ṛgveda Gaya is a proper name applied to a com-<BR>poser of hymns.^78 In the Atharvaveda^79 Gaya appears to be a<BR>wonder-worder or sorcerer along with Asita and Kaśyapa who<BR>later on transformed himself into Gayāsura.^80 According to<BR>the Vāyu Purāṇa,^81 the city was named Gaya after an Asura,<BR>Gaya by name (Gayāsura). Viṣṇu killed this demon but<BR>granted him a boon that this city would be held highly sacred.<BR>According to R.L. Mitra,^82 this story is an allegorical repre-<BR>sentation of the expulsion of Buddhism from Gayā which<BR>was the headquarters of the Buddhist faith. Aurṇavābha in ex-<BR>plaining ‘idam Viṣṇur-vī Cakrame tredhā nidadhe padam’^83<BR>in the Nirukta^84 holds that the three steps of Viṣṇu were placed<BR>on Samārohaṇa, Viṣṇupada and Gayaśiras. The Māhabhārata<BR>(III. 95 and VII. 64) describes the performance of sacrifices by<BR>Gaya^85 references to which^86 are also found in the Rāmā-<BR>yaṇa,^87 Bhāgavata Purāṇa^88 Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,^89 Agni<BR>Purāṇa,^90 Viṣṇu Purāṇa,^91 Vāmana Purāṇa,^92 etc. Aśvaghoṣa's<BR>Buddhacarita^93 (I or II cent. A.D.) speaks of the Buddha's<BR>visit to the hermitage called ‘the city of the royal sage Gaya’,<BR>who was later conceived as a great giant.^94<BR>We can find evidence of the importance of Gayā growing<BR>in the period subsequent to A.D. 750. At Gayā while we have<BR>only one inscription belonging to the Gupta period, we get<BR>numerous inscriptions belonging to the Pāla period.^95 But<BR>these records are of not much use for the history of the town,<BR>they simply show that till the end of the twelfth century A.D.<BR>it was under the Pālas.^96<BR>The city played no major role in polities at any period of<BR>history but it was certainly a centre of religious movements of<BR>Buddhist and the Brahmanical Hindus.^97 Gayā which was the<BR>headquarters of Buddhist faith passed to the Hindus between<BR>the second and fourth centuries of the Christian era and by<BR>A.D. 637 when Hiuen Tsang visited the city it had become a<BR>thriving centre of Hindu Brahmanical religion.^98<BR>The religious importance of Gayā is met with in the Māhā-<BR>bhārata,^99 Rāmāyaṇa^100 and Purāṇas.^101 The Gayā has a<BR>special religious importance with reference to the Śrāddha cere-<BR>mony.^102<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=214&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=344" target="_blank">Correction</a>

कोटिवर्ष
3. Koṭivarṣa (No. 34, L. 3; No. 35, L. 3; No. 36, L. 3; No. 37, L. 3):<BR>It has been described as a viṣaya under Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti.<BR>This reference clearly shows that the size of a viṣaya was small-<BR>er than that of a bhukti. The viṣaya of Koṭivarṣa occurs frequ-<BR>ently in the epigraphic records of the Pālas and Senas.^107 It<BR>seems to have comprised the southern part of the Dinajpur<BR>district, the northern portion of Rajashahi and probably also<BR>the eastern tracts of the Bogra district.^108 Its head-quarters was<BR>Diw-kot (Devakoṭa or Devīkoṭa).^109 Yādavaprakāśa identifies<BR>Koṭivarṣa with Devīkoṭṭa.^110 The Vāyu Purāṇa also refers to a<BR>city of the name of Koṭivarṣa.^111<BR>The Prakrit lexicon Pāia-sadda-mahaṇṇavo describes it as<BR>the capital of Lāṭa country.^112 The name is known to the Jain<BR>Prajñāpanā in which it is placed in Lāḍha or Lāṭa.^113<BR>Hemacandra^114 says that Koṭivarṣa, Bāṇapura, Devīkoṭa,<BR>Umāvana and Śoṇitapura are identical. Puruṣottama^115 agrees<BR>with Hemacandra with the only difference that he mentions<BR>Uṣāvana in place of Umāvana. Bāṇapura is represented by<BR>Bāngarh in the Dinajpur district, which still preserves the exten-<BR>sive ruins of a citadel known as Damdamaḥ said to have been<BR>the fort of Devīkoṭa associated with the exploits of the mythi-<BR>cal king Bāṇa.^116 Diw-koṭa or Devīkoṭa (wrongly read as Dihi-<BR>kota in the A-In-i-Akbarī) was a mahal under the Sarkar of<BR>Lakhnautī (Lakṣaṇavatī).^117<BR>The termination varṣa is significant. It denotes a division<BR>of the earth as separated off by mountain ranges.^118 From the<BR>Purāṇas we know of such names as Harivarṣa, Kiṃpuruṣa-<BR>Varṣa and Bhārata-Varṣa.^119 Varṣam in Pāṇini^120 means the<BR>rainy season. We know that rains are connected with the moun-<BR>tains. So originally the divisions might have been made accord-<BR>ing to the rains in different areas. Rains being very important<BR>for agriculture affect the inhabitants of a certain area through-<BR>out the year. Later on the semantic development of the word<BR>came to denote a year.

कृमिला
4. Kṛmilā (No. 40, L. 5):<BR>The Viṣaya or district of Kṛmilā also spelt as Krimilā is mention-<BR>ed in inscription No. 40. According to D.C. Sircar “as the<BR>charter is spurious and seems to have been forged a few centu-<BR>ries after Samudragupta's time, it may or may not prove the<BR>existence of a viṣaya and therefore of a city of the above name<BR>in the fourth century.^122 But certain old seals found at Nālandā<BR>prove the existence of Kṛmilā before the Pāla occupation of<BR>Bihar.^123 The village Kavāla in the Krimilāviṣaya known from<BR>one such seal can be identified with modern Kawāli not far<BR>from Valgūdar.^124 The viṣaya or district of Kṛmilā is also men-<BR>tioned in the records of the Pālas of Bengal and Bihar.^125<BR>According to a tradition recorded in the Harivaṃśa,^126<BR>Vayu Purāṇa^127 and the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa^128 Kṛmi, the son<BR>of king Uśīnara of the Puru dynasty, born of his second queen<BR>Kṛmi, was the lord of Kṛmilāpurī.^129<BR>In the Buddhist literature, we get various forms for the city<BR>of Kṛmilā: Kimilā, Kimmilā and Kimbilā. The name of an<BR>inhabitant of the city is given as Kimila, Kimmilā or Kimbilā.<BR>Malālasekera^130 recognises the spellings Kimilā or Kimbilā and<BR>Kimila or Kimbila, but prefers the forms Kimbilā and Kimbilā.<BR>Kimilā can be the Pali form of Sanskrit Kṛmilā (or Krimilā),<BR>and Kimmilā can be derived from the other Sanskrit variant<BR>Kirmilā.^131 Two Suttas, the Kimilāsutta and Kimilasutta, were<BR>preached by the Buddha when he was camping at the city of<BR>Kimilā (Kṛmilā) said to have been situated on the bank of the<BR>Gaṅgā. The river is now at a short distance from the villages<BR>of Valgūdar and Rajauna, on the site of which the ancient city<BR>stood.^132<BR>M.S. Pandey^133 opposes the identification of Kṛmilā with<BR>Valgūdar on the ground that there is not sufficient evidence<BR>to prove this identification. Though Kṛmilā is not referred to<BR>in early Pali literature, we find a city named Kṛmilā mention-<BR>ed in the Aṅguttara Nikāya Commentary.^134 According to this<BR>commentary, the city stood on the bank of the Gaṅgā. But<BR>now-a-days, the Gaṅgā flows at some distance from this region<BR>which may be due to a change in the course of the river dur-<BR>ing so many centuries. The city was not very important and<BR>may have gradually disappeared. At present we do not find<BR>any traces of the city: it may have been washed away by the<BR>Gaṅgā. According to Pandey^135 the name of the modern villa-<BR>ge Kiul has some resemblance with the name Kṛmilā and it is<BR>not unlikely that the city may have been somewhere in that<BR>locality.<BR>Sircar is himself not sure about the identification of Kṛmilā<BR>with Valgūdar^136 and seems to prefer the claim of modern<BR>Kawali not being far from Valgūdar Kṛmilā.^137 But in the<BR>district Gazetteer of Monghyr it is the village of Kiul which<BR>is mentioned and not Kawali. Hence we prefer the view of<BR>Dr. Pandey.<BR>The word Kṛmilā means “a fruitful woman” or “a place<BR>full of worms” and the word Kṛmi forming its first part is<BR>sometimes also written as Krimi.^138<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=217&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=347" target="_blank">Correction</a>

 Maṇḍala<BR>Maṇḍala is a territorial unit which is found in the inscriptions<BR>of many dynasties of the early medieval period.

But in the Gupta period maṇḍala is used<BR>for some kind of administrative division though in early medie-<BR>val period its use was in feudalistic association.^155 In Cālukyan<BR>records, the governor of a maṇḍala was usually called a Maṇḍ-<BR>aleśvara or Mahāmaṇḍaleśvara.^156 In the records of the Impe-<BR>rial Guptas it denoted a unit smaller than a Vīthī.^157 Literally<BR>meaning a circle or round it denotes a district, province, coun-<BR>try in general or it may signify a surrounding district or neigh-<BR>bouring state.^158<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=219&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=350" target="_blank">Correction</a>

ऐरिकिण
 Airikiṇa (No. 2, L. 25):<BR>It has been described here as the bhoga-nagara of the king (sva-<BR>bhoga-nagara).^164 In this context the use of the phrase ‘Sva-<BR>bhoganagara’ is important. K.P. Jayaswal^165 interprets ‘sva bho-<BR>ganagara’ as a town that had, since the victory scored by the<BR>Gupta king at Eraṇ, become his direct personal possession.<BR>Fleet translates it as ‘the city of his own enjoyment’.^166<BR>Daśaratha Sharma^167 explains it as analogous to the word<BR>‘Ekabhoga’ defined in the Mānasāra as a town or village inha-<BR>bited by a single land-holder along with his dependants.^168 It<BR>is ‘Svabhoga’ for the master and ‘Ekabhoga’ for others’. Sharma<BR>connects this ‘Svabhoga’ with a feudatory ‘who lived therein<BR>with his family and dependants, and on whom Samudragupta,<BR>pleased by his ‘devotion’, policy, and valour’ conferred the title<BR>of Rājan and the accompanying glories of consecration, etc.<BR>described in verse 4.^169 But Sharma seems to be incorrect in<BR>associating the inscription with a feudatory, the inscription<BR>belongs to Samudragupta himself which is clear by further<BR>description in subsequent verses.^170 No doubt in the Eraṇ<BR>Stone Boar Inscription of Toramāṇa^171 the word ‘sva-viṣaya’<BR>an adjectival clause of Airikiṇa is used to refer to a feudatory,<BR>which is very clear from the inscription.<BR>The editor^172 also, following Sharma, is misled and ex-<BR>plains the term ‘Svabhoga’ as implying a grant, or something<BR>like it by the governor of the province, who had for his own<BR>salary the revenues of the city of Airikiṇa allotted to him.^173<BR>But the term ‘Svabhoganagara’ is significant in connoting royal<BR>status, higher than that of a feudatory chief and can mean<BR>‘the capital city’ where the king himself was residing. In con-<BR>trast, in the Earṇ Stone Boar Inscription of Toramāṇa^174 the<BR>term ‘Sva-viṣaya’ has been used for the feudatory Dhanyaviṣṇu<BR>(of king Toramāṇa) who may have been a viṣayapati, the ad-<BR>ministrator-incharge of Eraṇ.<BR>Airikiṇa is the same as modern Eraṇ, the ancient Airikiṇa,<BR>a village on the left bank of the Bina, in Sagar District of<BR>Madhya Pradesh. From the Copper Coins of the Aśokan<BR>period found at Eraṇ, we get an earlier Pali or Prakrit form<BR>of the name which is Erakaña or Erakana or Erakaṇa.^175 It<BR>is thus clear that Erakaña or Erakaṇa is the simplified form of<BR>Erikiṇa: to simplify still more the medial letter ‘k’ has been<BR>dropped by the process of elision.^176 The meaning of the word<BR>Erikiṇa is a puzzle but its connexion with erakā ‘a kind of<BR>grass,^177 found in that area may be accepted as a hypothesis.<BR>Place-names ending in Deśa<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=220&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=354" target="_blank">Correction</a>

पुर्
 Pur or Pura<BR>Pur is a word of frequent occurrence in the Ṛgveda.^209 The<BR>early Vedic Āryans were not city builders. Puras^210 which are<BR>mentioned from the context seem to have been always associ-<BR>ated with the dasyus and the enemies of the Āryans.^211 Pura,<BR>the oldest Sanskrit word denoting city, is usually derived from<BR>the Dravidian ur. From what we read in the Ṛgveda about<BR>Puraṃdara's exploits in connection with the destruction of<BR>the ninety-nine puras of the Asuras who had been causing<BR>havoc to the gods, these puras seem to refer to the cities of<BR>the Indus Valley pre-Āryans.^212 But the word ur is not availa-<BR>ble in Dravidian lexicons: on the contrary it is pura which is<BR>mentioned by them.^213 The word ur is not to be traced in the<BR>I. E. languages.^214 We find Ur only as the name of a town in<BR>Babylonia.^215 In Tamil country, in the inscriptions of the<BR>Chola dynasty (A.D. 900-1300) the word ‘ur’ is used to<BR>refer to ‘The Primary Assembly of the villagers’ in the case of<BR>ordinary villages while in the same context the word Sabhā is<BR>used in case of Agrahāra villages, mostly tenanted by learned<BR>brāhmaṇas.^216<BR>In the later Vedic literature^217 the word Pur meant ‘rampart’,<BR>‘fort’, or ‘stronghold’. The meaning of Pura as ‘city’ developed<BR>later and was not at all in vogue in the Vedic literature.<BR>Lexicons define it as a place containing large buildings<BR>surrounded by a ditch and extending not less than one Kośa in<BR>length, if it extends for half that distance it is called a kheṭa;<BR>if less than that, a karvaṭa or small market town, any smaller<BR>cluster of houses is called a grāma or village.^218 The Sama-<BR>rāṅgaṇasūtradhāra describes puras as being of three kinds —<BR>Big, middle and small which have different measurements for<BR>their ditches, buildings, streets and road-ways.^219 The big one<BR>possesses a circumference of four thousand arcs, the middle of<BR>two thousand arcs and the small of one thousand arcs.^220<BR>T. Burrow derives pura from §pri to fill Piparti ‘fills’: pur ‘city’:<BR>Lithuanian pilis (l becomes r).^221 We find the word being spelt<BR>in two ways pur^222 and pura^223 Pur (city), from puru (much)<BR>and pūrṇa (full) means ‘plentitude’ or multitude of settlers.<BR>Similarly Greek polis (city) from poly (much): Latin populus<BR>(population, people) from plenus (full), and English folk from<BR>full. Pur is the city and puruṣa the citizen. Greek polites<BR>(citizens), is preserved in politics (civic concerns), police (city<BR>administration), and cosmopolitan (citizen of the world):<BR>Lithuanian pilis (fort, castle).^224 In modern times the word<BR>purā (from pura) is used for mohalla in India. It seems to be<BR>the result of Muslim contact.^225<BR>Pura, where it does not retain the original from pur, is<BR>changed into the following^226:<BR>(a) Wār: as Purushapura, Peshawar; Nalapura, Narwar;<BR>Matipura, Madwār; Śalwapura, Alwar; Candrapura,<BR>Candwar.<BR>(b) Urs or ur, as Māyāpura, Mayura; Siṃhapura, Siṅgur;<BR>Juṣkapura, Zukur<BR>(c) Or, as Traipura, Tcor; Candrādityapura, Caindor<BR>(d) Ora, as Ilbalapura, Ellora<BR>(e) Ore, as Lavapura, Lahore<BR>(f) Ola, as Āryapura, Aihole<BR>(g) ar, as Kusumapura, Kumrār<BR>(h) aur, as Siddhapura, Siddhaur<BR>(i) Own, as Hiraṇyapura, Hindoun or Herdoun<BR>There are many names with the suffix Pura in the Aṣṭā-<BR>dhyāyī, Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya and the Kāśikā.^227 The word<BR>Mahāpura in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās^228 and the Brāhmaṇas^229<BR>denotes a great fortress.

दशपुर
(3) Daśapura (No. 17, L. 4, L. 16):<BR>In this inscription L. 4 refers to the migration of a guild of silk-<BR>weavers from Lāṭa viṣaya (Central and Southern Gujarat) to<BR>the city of Daśapura. The guild came to this city attracted by<BR>the virtues of its kings.^234 The inscription refers itself to the<BR>reign of king Kumāragupta, under whom Bandhuvarman, the<BR>son of Viśvavarman^235 was the governor at Daśapura. L. 16 of<BR>the inscription records that it was under the governorship of<BR>Bandhuvarman (in Mālava era 493 = A.D. 437)^236, that a lofty<BR>temple of the Sun-god was caused to be built by the guild of<BR>silk-cloth weavers at Daśapura.^237 Afterwards, under other<BR>kings, part of this temple fell into disrepair. And then it was<BR>restored by the same guild in the year 529 of the Mālava era<BR>(= A.D. 473).^238<BR>Daśapura has been identified with Mandasor in Western<BR>Malwa^239 formerly in the Gwalior State. The ancient Daśapura<BR>stood on the north or left bank of the Siwana, a tributary of<BR>the river Śiprā.^240 We also find it mentioned in the Mandasor<BR>Fragmentary Inscription of the time of Ādityavardhana (A.D.<BR>490-500).^241 Under the Imperial Guptas the use of the Mālava<BR>or the Kṛta era seems to have been confined to Daśapura.^242<BR>Thus Daśapura may have been the main city of the Western<BR>Mālavas. We also get a reference to Daśapura in the Bṛhat-<BR>saṃhitā^243 and the Meghadūta^244 of Kālidāsa.<BR>The ancient Sanskrit name Daśapura also occurs in an early<BR>Nasik inscription of Uṣavadāta,^245 and in one inscription of<BR>Vikram Saṃvat 1321 (= A.D. 1264) from Mandasor itself.^246<BR>There are two explanations of the name Daśapura or Dasor.<BR>The local explanation is that the place was originally a city of<BR>the Puranic king Daśaratha. But, on this view, the name of the<BR>city should have been Daśarathapura or Dasrathore. Fleet<BR>points out that even now, the township includes some twelve<BR>to fifteen outlying hamlets or divisions (Khilcipur, Jankūpurā,<BR>Rāmpuriyā, Candrapurā, Bālagañja, etc.) and that ‘when it was<BR>originally constituted, it included exactly ten (daśa) such ham-<BR>lets (pura)’.^247 This view of Fleet is more appealing.<BR>Mandasor, the full form of the name of the town by which<BR>it is officially known and which is entered in maps, is also<BR>explained in two ways:<BR>As suggested by Bhagwan Lal Indraji, it may represent<BR>Manda-Daśapura, “the distressed or afflicted Daśapura,” referr-<BR>ing to the overthrow of the town, and the destruction of the<BR>Hindu temples in it, by the Musalmans, in memory of which,<BR>even to the present day, the Nāgar brāhmaṇas of the area do<BR>not drink water there. This is supported by the fact that some<BR>paṇḍits still call it Mannadasor.^248<BR>F.S. Growse suggests that the name combines the two<BR>names of Mad and Daśapura: the former^249 being the name of<BR>a village (also called Afzalpur) about eleven miles south-east of<BR>Mandasor, from which, it is said, were brought, from ruined<BR>Hindu temples, the stones that were used in the construction<BR>of the Musalman fort at Mandasor.^250<BR>It is very difficult to choose between the two explanations,<BR>but the second seems to be more reasonable.<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=226&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=368" target="_blank">Correction</a>

इन्द्रपुर
(4) Indrapura (No. 16, L. 5, L. 6, L. 7, L. 8):<BR>The inscription states that an endowment was given by a brāh-<BR>maṇa named Devaviṣṇu for the maintenance of a lamp in a<BR>temple of the Sun established by the merchants of the town of<BR>Indrapura kṣatriyas named Acalavarman and Bhrukuṇṭhasiṃha<BR>at Indrapura.<BR>In line 5 we get ‘Candrāpuraka-Padmā’ as the reading<BR>taken by Fleet^251 and he thus considers it a separate town than<BR>Indrapura.^252 But the correct reading should be as ‘Cendra-<BR>puraka-Padmā’, since we find a small stroke by the left side of<BR>‘c’. The stroke in other lines for ‘e’ is very clear (e. g. in L. 2)<BR>though it is not very clear in L. 5 still we cannot read it simply<BR>‘c’. The reading ‘ce’ for ‘c’ has been suggested by Sircar and<BR>Jagannath.^253 Thus we see that the Padmā referred in line 5<BR>of this inscription also belongs to Indrapura.<BR>Now we find two different spellings of Indrāpura in lines 5<BR>and 6 and Indrapura in lines 7 and 8.^254<BR>What we can find out here is that the affix ‘ka’ in lines 5<BR>and 6 is very important which seems to have grammatically a<BR>succinct purpose here. The vṛddhi of the first vowel ‘i’ was<BR>desirable here as is also clear by the use of affix ‘ka’ in the<BR>Allahabad Inscription of Samudragupta.^255 So it is a weaker<BR>form of the affix ‘ka’, without vṛddhi of the vowel in the first<BR>syllable.^256 The writer seems to have used the long vowel<BR>(with the last syllable of Indra) instead of vṛddhi in the first<BR>syllable to avoid confusion between Aindrapura and Indrapura.<BR>We do not find any such example of the elongation of vowel<BR>in the classical Sanskrit literature though we find its rare use<BR>in Vedic literature.^257 So we shall translate ‘Indrāpuraka Pad-<BR>mā’ as ‘Padmā of (the town of) Indrapura and ‘Indrapuraka-<BR>vaṇigbhyām’ as ‘merchants of (the town of) Indrapura’. This<BR>Indrapura is the same as modern Indor,^258 near Dibhāi, Buland-<BR>shahr district, U.P.^259 The ancient town of Indrapura was<BR>situated on a large and lofty mound about five miles to the<BR>north-west of Dibhāi.^260 Now-a-days it is only a kheḍā or deser-<BR>ted mound, and is not shown in maps^261<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=227&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=369" target="_blank">Correction</a>

(5) Kartṛpura (No. I, L. 22):<BR>Though the most accepted and correct reading is Kartṛpura,<BR>some scholars prefer to read Katṛipura^262 or Kātripura.^263<BR>It is one of the five frontier kingdoms^264 mentioned in the<BR>inscription whose kings did homage and paid tribute to Samu-<BR>dragupta. Scholars differ in their views about the identification<BR>of this place-name:<BR>According to smith,^265 this kingdom ‘occupied the lower<BR>ranges of the western Himalayas, including probably Kumaon,<BR>Garhwal, and Kangra’. Oldham^266 holds that the kingdom of<BR>Kātripura, included Kumaun, Almora, Garhwal and Kangra.<BR>Fleet^267 suggests that the name may survive in Kartarpur in<BR>the Jullundur district.<BR>We prefer the view of Daśaratha Sharma.^268 His conten-<BR>tion is that amongst the five frontier kingdoms mentioned in<BR>the inscription, the first three belong to the East, the fourth<BR>one belongs to the North, hence it will be better to leave aside<BR>the northern and eastern sides of the empire and to look for<BR>Kartṛpura somewhere to the west of the Gupta dominions.<BR>Consequently he finds Karor or Karūr to be a good equivalent<BR>for Kartṛpura.^269 Kara here stands for Kartṛ and ‘ur’ or ‘ūr’<BR>would stand here for pura.^270 Karūr, again, is to be preferred<BR>to the other alternatives on account of its associations with the<BR>Gupta period of Indian History. According to Al-Beruni, an<BR>eastern king, called Vikramāditya, put to flight and killed a<BR>Śaka ruler in the region of Karūr, between Multan and Loni.^271<BR>This Vikramāditya is to be identified with Candragupta II<BR>‘the enemy of the Śakas’, who disguised as his brother's wife,<BR>Dhruvasvāminī, ‘ripped upon the belly of the Śaka ruler’,<BR>and destroyed the Śaka army, most probably, in Kartṛpura or<BR>Karūr.^272<BR>This was the first encounter between the Śakas and Vikramā-<BR>ditya, and Karūr, Karor, or Kartṛpura was the theatre of the<BR>war because of its intermediate position between the Śaka<BR>dominions and the Gupta empire.^273<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=228&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=370" target="_blank">Correction</a>

पाटलिपुत्र
(8) Pāṭaliputra (No. 7, L. 12; No. 6, L. 4; No. 1, L. 14):<BR>It is the same as modern Patna situated to the south of the<BR>river Gaṅgā. Inscription No. 7 refers to Pāṭaliputra. Inscrip-<BR>tion No. 6 mentions Vīrasena, the child of Kutsa, the minister<BR>for peace and war under Candragupta II, who knew the mean-<BR>ings of the words, and logic, and (the ways of) mankind,<BR>who was a poet and who belonged to (the city of) Pāṭali-<BR>putra.^290 Inscription No. 1 mentions a city named Puṣpa<BR>where Samudragupta enjoyed playfully while he was young.^291<BR>Apparently, the city was the Gupta capital. We also find the<BR>word Pāṭaliputa (Pāṭaliputra) used by Aśoka, in his rock<BR>edicts.^292 The city was also known as Kusumapura due to the<BR>abundance of flowers.^293 Its name Puṣpapura is also met with<BR>in the Raghuvaṃśa.^294 It is mentioned in the Mudrārākṣasa<BR>as well.^295 The Kathāsaritsāgara of Somadeva^296 (11th century)<BR>describes it as a place of both wealth and education though<BR>generally there is a fight between Śrī (lakṣmī) and Sarasvatī.^297<BR>The Kāvyamīmāṃsā of Rājaśekhara (A.D. 900) mentions a<BR>tradition that there were assemblies of scholars called brahma-<BR>sabhās, organised by kings, which examined poets like Kālidāsa,<BR>Bhartṛmaṇṭha, Amara, Rūpa, Āryaśūra, Bhāravi and Candra-<BR>gupta in Viśālā (Ujjainī) and where such great masters of gram-<BR>mar as Upavarṣa, Pāṇini, Piṅgala, Vyāḍi, Vararūci and<BR>Patañjali were examined in Pāṭaliputra and attained fame.^298<BR>The Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa^299 (A.D. 800) mentions Pāṭali-<BR>putra as Nandanagara. This work refers to king Nanda, his<BR>learned Council of brāhmaṇa philosophers and to his intimacy<BR>with Pāṇini. “After him (Sūrasena) there will be king Nanda<BR>at Puṣpa city. In the capital of the Magadha residents there<BR>will be brāhmaṇa controversialists and the king will be surroun-<BR>ded by them. The king will give them riches. His minister was<BR>a Buddhist brāhmaṇa, Vararūci, who was of high soul, kind<BR>and good. His great friend was a brāhmaṇa, Pāṇini by<BR>name”.^300<BR>The Kāśikā^301 records two divisions of Pāṭaliputra:<BR>1. Pūrva-Pāṭaliputra (eastern on the Gaṅgā)<BR>2. Apara-Pāṭaliputra (western on the Śoṇa)<BR>Patañjali^302 mentions the western Pāṭaliputra. A citizen<BR>of Pāṭaliputra was called Pāṭaliputraka.^303<BR>The city is named as Palibothra by Megasthenes, the Am-<BR>bassador of Seleucus Nicator at the court of King Candragupta<BR>Maurya.^304 The Pāla inscriptions refer to it by the name<BR>Śrīnagara.^305<BR>The termination ‘Putra’ in Pāṭaliputra is difficult to<BR>explain. We find it being used with ‘Brahman’ to denote<BR>the river ‘Brahmaputra’. As regards places-names we find the<BR>mention of Saitya puta (Satiya-putra) and Kerala-puta (Kerala<BR>putra) in Aśokan Rock-edicts.^306<BR>The name Pāṭaliputra is taken to mean “the son (putra) of<BR>Pāṭali, i. e. the trumpet flower. The words Puṣpapura and<BR>Kusumapura also mean ‘a city of flowers’. The word ‘Śrīnag-<BR>ara’ means ‘a beautiful city.^307 Because of the abundance of<BR>flowers the city may have looked beautiful. It was known by<BR>other names also, viz., Puṣpapura, Puspapurī and Kusumapura.^308<BR>According to Yuan-Chwang, it had been called Kusumapura<BR>(K' u-su-mo-pu-lo) on account of the numerous flowers (kus-<BR>uma) in the royal enclosure.^309 Later its glory was replaced by<BR>that of Kānyakubja which came to be known as Kusumapura.^310<BR>The meaning of ‘Pāṭaliputra’ is explained in the legendary<BR>origin of the city. According to the legend: there was a<BR>brāhmaṇa of high talent and singular learning. Many flocked<BR>to him to receive instruction. One day all his students went<BR>out on a tour of observation. One of them looked very sad.<BR>When asked, he told that his life was waning without any<BR>company. In a joke his friends made the Pāṭali tree, under<BR>which they were standing, his father-in-law: in other words<BR>he was to marry the daughter of the tree, or a Pāṭali flower<BR>(Bignonia Suaveloens).^311 As the Sun was about to set, all<BR>the students proposed to return home but the young student<BR>fascinated by love stayed there fearlessly. Accidentally, next<BR>day he was married with the young daughter of an old couple.<BR>After a year his wife gave birth to a son. He declined to stay<BR>there fearing the exposure to wind and weather. But the<BR>old man (the father of the wife) constructed a house for him<BR>and made him stay there. When the old capital of Kusuma-<BR>pura was changed, this town was chosen, and “as the genie<BR>built the mansion for the youth the country was named as<BR>Pāṭaliputrapura (the city of the son of the Pāṭali tree).”^312<BR>It is not unlikely that originally the name of the city was<BR>Pāṭaliputrapura and that later suffix Pura was dropped.<BR>The Buddhist literature informs us that Pāṭaliputra was<BR>originally a village known as Pāṭaligāma. Ajātaśatru is said<BR>to have fortified it in order to check the attacks of the Licc-<BR>havis who often harassed its inhabitants. The Buddha on his<BR>way from Rājagṛha to Vaiśālī, passed through this village<BR>on his last journey and is said to have predicted that the village<BR>was destined to become a great city.^313<BR>The Vāyu-Purāṇa attributes the real foundation of Pāṭali-<BR>putra to Rājā Ajāta-Śatru's grandson, Udaya or Udayāśva.<BR>It was he who first removed the capital from Rājagṛha to<BR>Pāṭaliputra (during the last part of the 6th century B.C.)^314<BR>Pāṭaliputra had closely been associated with multifarious<BR>political and cultural activities right from the fifth century<BR>B.C. to the later part of the sixth century A.D.^315 It had the<BR>honour to be the capital of the Śaiśunāgas, the Nandas, the<BR>Mauryas and the great Imperial Guptas until the Hūṇa inva-<BR>sion in the 6th century A.D. when it was ruined. Harṣavardhana<BR>(7th century A.D.) made no attempt to restore it.^316 Śaśāṅka<BR>Narendragupta destroyed many Buddhist temples and monas-<BR>teries at Pāṭaliputra.^317 Dharmapāla, the most powerful of<BR>the Pāla kings of Bengal and Bihar, tried to restore its glory.^318<BR>Coming to medieval times, we find that it remained deserted<BR>for a number of centuries. It was Sher Shah, who, in about<BR>A.D. 1541 occupied it again as a royal city and built a fort<BR>there. It then came into importance under its modern name<BR>Patna (from Skt. Pattana) i. e. the town or city. It is even now<BR>the capital of Bihar.^319<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=230&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=373" target="_blank">Correction</a>

This grant<BR>records that Anantavarman's grandfather Guṇavarman ruled<BR>over Devarāṣṭra with Piṣṭapura as its chief city.^325 In our<BR>inscription Devarāṣṭra^326 has been treated separately. It seems<BR>that during Samudragupta's time these two States (Devarāṣṭra<BR>and Kaliṅga) were separate states but later on under Guṇavar-<BR>man they were amalgamated.<BR>Guha ruled over the whole of Kaliṅga and the neighbour-<BR>ing regions.^327 Guha belonged to the Sālaṅkāyana family of<BR>brāhmaṇas. Samudragupta installed him as his viceroy in<BR>Kaliṅga.^328 Guha was already reigning over Kaliṅga (with his<BR>capital at Piṣṭapura) when Samudragupta conquered him and<BR>placed him as his feudatory. ‘Mahendragiri’ may have been<BR>another name given to him on account of the extension of<BR>his dominion over the Mahendra mountain.^329 It is interesting<BR>to note that Kālidāsa^330 refers to Raghu defeating a king<BR>named Mahendranātha in the course of his southern campaign.<BR>It is tempting to connect Mahendranātha with Mahendragiri.<BR>After the victory of Samudragupta, Guha was confirmed in<BR>the enjoyment of sovereignty under the imperial tutelage.^331<BR>At Piṣṭapura there is a Vaiṣṇava temple named Kunti-<BR>mādhava.^332 We get references to Piṣṭapurī or Piṣṭapurikādevī,<BR>a form at Mānapura, of the goddess Lakṣmī, in the inscriptions<BR>of the Privrājaka Mahārājas and the Mahārājas of Uccakalpa<BR>during the Gupta period.^333 This must be a local form of some<BR>popular goddess at Piṣṭapura itself.^334<BR>Place-names ending in the Suffix Nagara<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=233&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=374" target="_blank">Correction</a>

नगर
 Nagara:<BR>Nagara means a town, a city.^335 we find the term being<BR>used by Pāṇini (IV. 2. 142).^336 The word Nāgaraka (or<BR>Nāgarika)^337 also occurs in Sanskrit literature as standing for<BR>‘an inhabitant of a town’ but sometimes its use was restricted<BR>for the chief of a town or a police-officer. In modern times<BR>nāgarika is used to refer to ‘a citizen of a state whether living<BR>in city or village’.<BR>In the early Vedic literature Nagara is found only as the<BR>derivative adjective Nagarin, used as a proper name, but it<BR>appears in the sense of ‘town’ in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (1. 11,<BR>18: 31, 4) and frequently in the later works.^338<BR>Nagara is an important factor which helps us to distinguish<BR>Janapada from rāṣṭra: nagara forms a part of the rāṣṭra but<BR>is excluded from the Janapada.^339 Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra<BR>uses Nagara and Pura as synonyms.^340 It is significant that<BR>the word Nagara is of late occurrence.^341 It is likely<BR>that in the early Vedic times city life does not seem to have<BR>developed much. In the Epic,^342 there are references to<BR>Nagara, ‘a city’: Grāma ‘Village’: and Ghoṣa ‘ranch’. Vedic<BR>literature especially of the earlier period is generally confined<BR>to the village.

Csoma de<BR>kōrös^361 calls this place as “Sāketan or Ayodhyā” and H.H.<BR>Wilson in his dictionary, refers to Sāketa as ‘the city of<BR>Ayodhyā’. Several passages in the Raghuvaṃśa^362 confirm it.<BR>The Vividhatīrthakalpa mentions Sākeyam (Sāketa) as a<BR>synonym for Ayodhyā,^363 but in the Buddhist literature we find<BR>separate references to Ayodhyā and Sāketa which creates<BR>doubt about their identity and suggests that the two existed<BR>separately.^364 V. Pathak quotes a well known verse occurring<BR>in the Yuga Purāṇa, a section of Gārgī Saṃhitā,^365 to show<BR>that Sāketa is the same as Ayodhyā. But there is nothing in<BR>the passage to support the view.<BR>The ancient city of Ayodhyā or Sāketa is described in the<BR>Rāmāyaṇa as situated on the banks of the Sarayū or Sarjū<BR>river.^366 During the Buddhist period, Ayodhyā was divided into<BR>Uttara (Northern) Kosala and Dakṣiṇa (Southern) Kosala.<BR>The river Sarayū was the dividing line between the two pro-<BR>vinces. Ayodhyā was the capital of the latter.^367 Ancient<BR>tradition believes it to have been built by Manu.^368<BR>The history of Kośala, with its mighty King Prasenajit and<BR>his son Vidudabha pales into insignificance with the emergence<BR>of the Magadhan rulers as powerful antagonists. The Nandas,<BR>followed by the Mauryas, assimilated Kośala in their empire.<BR>Under the Śuṅgas, it was being ruled by a viceroy. An inscrip-<BR>tion from Ayodhyā mentions Puṣyamitra as having performed<BR>two horse-sacrifices. Under the Kuṣāṇas, the city remained<BR>more or less in oblivion. Subsequently in the Purāṇas it figures<BR>along with Prayāga and Magadha as forming part of<BR>the kingdom of the Guptas. The spurious Gayā Plate of<BR>Samudragupta (No. 21) mentions it as a seat of a Gupta<BR>camp of victory. The history of the city in the post-<BR>Gupta period is wrapped up in obscurity. It was within the<BR>empire of the Pratihāras and Gāhaḍavālas of Kanauj. Ayodhyā<BR>is described by Muslim historians^369 to have been a wilder-<BR>ness.<BR>The Slaves and Khilji rulers held sway over it, and subse-<BR>quently it received importance as the headquarters of Oudh.<BR>It was under the charge of Muslim governors appointed from<BR>Delhi, but with the emergence of Jaunpur as a strong kingdom<BR>Ayodhyā was completely over-shadowed. It was a mint-town<BR>in the time of Akbar, but there is no reference to it in later<BR>Chronicles.^370<BR>Ayodhyā is important as a centre of pilgrimage. There are<BR>several places in the city connected with different events in the<BR>life of Rāma. Rāma was born at a place called Janmasthāna. At<BR>Chīrodaka also called Chīrasāgara, Daśaratha performed, with<BR>the help of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga Ṛṣi, the sacrifices for obtaining a son.<BR>At a place called Tretā-kā-Ṭhākur, Rāmacandra performed the<BR>horse sacrifice by setting up the image of Sītā. At Ratnamaṇ-<BR>ḍapa, he held his Council,^371 at Swargadwāram in Fyzabad,<BR>his body was burnt. At Lakṣmaṇa-kuṇḍa, Lakṣmaṇa disappeared<BR>in the river Sarayū. Daśaratha accidentally killed Śravaṇa,<BR>the blind Ṛṣi's son, at Majhaurā in the district of Fyzabad.^372<BR>Ayodhyā engaged the attention of the Muslim rulers some of<BR>whom set up mosques here, of these the mosques of Babar and<BR>and Aurangzeb are notable.^373 At present this city forms a<BR>part of the district of Fyzabad.<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=236&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=384" target="_blank">Correction</a>

ग्राम
 Grāma:<BR>It means an inhabited place, village, hamlet.^383 It seems<BR>that firstly the word grāma denoted the collective inhabi-<BR>tants of a place, community or race. Later on this sense was<BR>transferred to an inhabitation and was used in the sense of a<BR>village. The earlier usage of this word, which occurs frequently<BR>from the Ṛgveda^384 onwards, appears to have been in the sense<BR>of a village. The early Āryans must have dwelt in villages which<BR>were scattered over the country, some close together, some far<BR>apart, and were connected by roads.^385 In the early Vedic<BR>literature village is regularly contrasted with the forest (āraṇya)<BR>in the evening the cattle regularly returned thither from the<BR>forest.^386 The villages were probably open, though perhaps a<BR>fort(pur) might on occasion be built inside.^387 Presumably they<BR>consisted of detached houses with enclosures, but no details<BR>are to be found in Vedic literature. Large villages (mahā-<BR>grāmāḥ) were known.^388 The grāma may, however, perhaps<BR>be regarded more correctly as an aggregate of several fami-<BR>lies, not necessarily forming a clan, but only part of a clan<BR>(viś), as is often the case at the present day.^389 The head of the<BR>village was called Grāmaṇi or ‘the leader of the village’. The<BR>king's share in a village is referred to as early as the<BR>Atharvaveda.^390<BR>Villages played an important role as a unit of Rāṣṭra or<BR>city.^391 Kheṭa was the half of a city and the village was the<BR>half of a kheṭa.^392 Cities other than the capital are called<BR>Karvaṭa, a little less is Nigama and lesser is grāma and still<BR>lesser is a house.^393<BR>Grāma is changed into gaon,^394 as Suvarṇagrāma, Sonār-<BR>gaon; Kalahagrāma, Kahalgaon.<BR>Following are the place-name with this suffix.

Actually Himavac-Chikhara is<BR>associated with Kokāmukhasvāmin (a form of the Boar incar-<BR>nation of Viṣṇu) and Śvetavarāhasvāmin where originally (ādya)<BR>these gods were installed in a temple. The name Doṅgā-grāma<BR>is used for the place where the lands were donated by Ṛbhupāla<BR>for the construction of the two temples having the names of the<BR>two deities.^406 The word ‘ādya’ in L. 7 is significant and dis-<BR>tinguishes the temples at Himavac-Chikhara from those at<BR>Doṅgā-grāma. The writer had to use the word ‘Himavac-<BR>Chikhara’ again in L. 10, with the names of Kokāmukhasvāmin<BR>and Śvetavarāhasvāmin in order to avoid confusion between<BR>the temples at the two places. For the temple at Doṅgā-grāma<BR>the writer uses the word ‘iha’ in L. 11. We also find the word<BR>‘Himavac-Chikhara’ absent in another Dāmodarpur Copper<BR>Plate Inscription of the Gupta Year 224 (= A.D. 543), where<BR>a person named Amṛtadeva hailing from Ayodhyā donates a<BR>land for the repairs and worship, etc., at the temple of Lord<BR>Śvetavarāhasvāmin obviously because he was referring to the<BR>temple at Doṅgā-grāma and there was now, no question of any<BR>confusion or distinction.^407 Thus Doṅgāgrāma does not seem<BR>to have any connection with Himavac-Chikhara. This village<BR>is to be located somewhere near Dāmodarpur and belonged to<BR>the Koṭivarṣa viṣaya as mentioned in the records.^408 But the<BR>village was most probably situated in a hilly area which is clear<BR>from the word Doṅgā itself.^409 The word ‘Atrāraṇye’ (local<BR>forest where the temple of Śvetavarāhasvāmin was situated) in<BR>No. 37 also attests to it.^410 The village may have consisted of a<BR>few huts with bushes and trees all around or the place where<BR>the temples were situated was away from habitation.<BR>Thus the earlier suggestion that the Koṭivarṣa district<BR>included the hilly region bordering on the northern fringe of<BR>Bengal,^411 which was rejected by Sircar,^412 seems to be<BR>correct.<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=240&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=395" target="_blank">Correction</a>

Moreover, the<BR>context of both the lines 20 and 2 is the same.<BR>The word gohālī when joined with the suffix ‘saṃ’ means<BR>‘a good gohālī’.

पल्ली
 Pallī<BR>The suffix — palli, pallī, pallaka or its diminutive pallikā is<BR>derived from §pal to go, to move.^442 It means a small village,<BR>(esp.) a settlement of wild tribes (e. g. Triśira-pallī = Trichin-<BR>opoly).^443 Pallī has been used as meaning a den of thieves in<BR>the Uttarādhyanasūtra and other Jain canonical texts,^444 the<BR>earliest portions of which are assigned to about 300 B.C.^445<BR>The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra by king Bhojadeva, an ele-<BR>venth century work, defines Pallī thus:<BR>“Where Pulindas^446 live building their huts with leafs,<BR>branches and stones etc. is called Pallī and a small Pallī is<BR>called Pallīkā”.^447<BR>Its derivation from §pal to go, to move, fits in very well as<BR>it was an inhabitation of Ābhīras, thieves and barbarians who<BR>moved from one place to another and were usually in small<BR>number.<BR>It seems to be a Dravidian word loaned in Sanskrit. We<BR>find in Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada the word palli meaning<BR>hamlet, settlement, small village and in Telugu the words Palli<BR>and Palliya denoting ‘a small village’.^448<BR>Pallī^449 is changed into:<BR>(a) bal: Āśāpallī, Yessabal<BR>(b) Poli, as Triśirapallī (= Trishṇāpallī), Trichinopoly<BR>(c) oli, as Ahalyapallī, Ahiroli (also Ahiāri).<BR>We have only one place-name ending in this suffix, with<BR>a slight variation which is ‘palla’ and is detailed below:<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=244&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=410" target="_blank">Correction</a>

क्षेत्र
 Kṣetra<BR>Originally meaning an agricultural field, in which sense its<BR>use survives, kṣetra came to be used as a place-name suffix<BR>as we find in the word Kurukṣetra. As a suffix in com-<BR>position it signified simply a ‘field’ for the word preceding it.<BR>For example karma-kṣetra, dharma-kṣetra, raṇa-kṣetra, siddha-<BR>kṣetra, sureśvarī-kṣetra.^480<BR>The use of this word^481 in the Ṛgveda points clearly to the<BR>existence of separate fields^482 carefully measured off,^483 though<BR>in some passages the meaning is less definite, indicating culti-<BR>vated land generally.^484 In the Atharvaveda^485 and later, the<BR>sense of a separate field is clearly marked, though the more<BR>general use is also found.^486 The deity Kṣetrasya Pati,^487 ‘Lord<BR>of the Field’ should probably be understood as the god presid-<BR>ing over each field, just as Vāstoṣpati presides over each<BR>dwelling.^488<BR>Kṣetra is changed into:^489<BR>(a) Chatra as Ahikṣetra, Ahichatra<BR>(b) Cchatra as Ahikṣetra, Ahicchatra.<BR>In Prakrit Kṣetra changes to Kheṭṭa meaning ‘a land for<BR>agriculture’, country, village and city, etc.^490<BR>Analogous to Kheṭṭa is the word ‘kheḍa’ or ‘kheṭa’ which<BR>means ‘a city surrounded by rivers and mountains’.^491 ‘Kheṭa’<BR>meaning ‘a small hamlet’ is also found in Pāṇini (VI. 2. 126).^492<BR>The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra defines ‘Kheṭa’ as the half of a<BR>city and the grāma as the half of a ‘Kheṭa’.^493 According to<BR>Monier Williams Kheṭa means a village, residence of peasants<BR>and farmers, small town (half of a Pura).^494<BR>Lele^495 considers Kheṭa or Kheṭaka to be the dialectic form<BR>of the word ‘Kṣetra’. The original meaning of Kheṭaka or Kheṭa<BR>was an enclosure for cattle. In the course of time the pastoral<BR>camp grew into an agricultural village, and the word Kheṭaka<BR>came to include agricultural village.^496<BR>Here we collect the names of fields appearing in the inscri-<BR>ptions of our study. These names can be attributed to the<BR>names of individuals or gods. As the proper names are a part<BR>of the names of the fields, we treat them as place-names and do<BR>not discuss them in the context of personal-names.

3. Kāmarūpa (No. I, L. 22):<BR>It has been mentioned as one of the frontier states which were<BR>subordinate to Samudragupta and whose emperors paid him<BR>taxes and all kinds of obeisance. Majumdar^539 identifies it with<BR>Upper Assam. Kāmarūpa consisted of the Western districts of<BR>the Brahmaputra valley which being the most powerful state<BR>and being the first to be approached from the western side<BR>came to denote the whole valley.^540 The area of Kāmarūpa<BR>was estimated by the Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang to have<BR>been 10,000 li i. e. 1667 miles in circuit which shows that it<BR>must have comprised the whole valley of Brahmaputra.^541<BR>Śaktisaṅgama describes^542 Kāmarūpa as extending from Kāle-<BR>śvara to the Śvetagiri and from Tripura to the Nīla-parvata<BR>(which is the Nilādri or Nīlakūṭa, the name of the Kāmākhyā<BR>hill). According to the Yoginī Tantra, the kingdom of Kāma-<BR>rūpa included the whole of the Brahmaputra valley together<BR>with Rangpur and Cochbihar.^543 The Purāṇas mention Prāg-<BR>jyotiṣa, identified with Kāmākhyā or Gauhati, as the capital of<BR>Kāmarūpa.^544 The Kamauli grant of Vaidyadeva mentions<BR>Kāmarūpa as a Maṇḍala of the Prāgjyotiṣa-bhukti.^545<BR>The Abhidhāna, the Vaijayantī and the Trikāṇḍaśeṣa in-<BR>form us that Prāgjyotiṣa and Kāmarūpa were the same coun-<BR>try.^546 In the Raghuvaṃśa,^547 the separate mention of Prāg-<BR>jyotiṣa and Kāmarūpa may seem to be a little puzzling. But<BR>we see that whereas verses 81-82 of the fourth canto refer to<BR>the king of Prāgjyotiṣa as terrified, the subsequent verses<BR>describe the presentation of elephants and the offer of respects<BR>by the king of Kāmarūpa to Raghu. Thus all the four verses<BR>are inter-linked and, the context also proves that Prāgjyotiṣa<BR>and Kāmarūpa were the same.^548 The Buddhist Chronicle<BR>Ārya-mañjuśrī-mūlakalpa describes Kāmarūpa as a country of<BR>the east.^549 The Bṛhatsaṃhitā^550 and the Kāvyamīmāṃsā^551<BR>also mention it in the same direction. Chatterji remarks that<BR>the tribes living on the frontiers of Kāmarūpa were akin to the<BR>Man tribes of South-Western China, a wild Tibeto-Chinese<BR>people.^552<BR>The Ahoms of the Shan Tribe came into Assam at the be-<BR>ginning of the 13th century due to the break-up of the Chinese<BR>empire by the Moguls and ruled till the British occupation in<BR>the beginning of the 19th century.^553<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=253&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=447" target="_blank">Correction</a>

4. Kāñcī (No. I, L. 19):<BR>The earliest epigraphic mention of Kāñcī is to be found in this<BR>inscription. The inscription refers to Viṣṇugopa of Kāñcī as<BR>one of the kings of Dakṣiṇāpatha defeated by Samudragupta<BR>but reinstated in their kingdoms. Kāñcī is the same as Kāñcīpura<BR>or modern Conjeevaram in the Chingleput district of Madras<BR>Presidency.^554 The kingdom of Kāñcī extended from the mouth<BR>of the Krishna to the south of the river Palar and sometimes<BR>even to the Kaveri.^555 It is also known as Kāñcīpeḍu.^556 It is<BR>mentioned in several early records relating to the ancient his-<BR>tory of the Pallavas of Kāñcī (of about A.D. 250 to 355)^557 The<BR>Aihole inscription of Pulakeśin, the Cālukya ruler in the 7th<BR>century A.D. refers to his conquest of Kāñcīpura.^558 The ear-<BR>liest literary reference to Kāñcī is in the Mahābhāṣya of Patañ-<BR>jali.^559<BR>The Mahābhāṣya on Vārttika 26 to Pāṇini IV. 2. 104 men-<BR>tions Kāñcīpuraka (i. e. a resident of Kāñcīpura).^560 Hiuen<BR>Tsang informs us that Kāñcī was 30 li or 5 miles in circuit, and<BR>that in the city there were eighty Deva temples and many here-<BR>ties called Nirgranthas.^561<BR>The Purāṇas attach great importance to Kāñcī.^562 It is<BR>included in a list of seven holy cities of India.^563 The Brah-<BR>māṇḍa Purāṇa^564 associates Kāñcī with Kāśī, the two forming<BR>the two eyes of Śiva. It is stated in the Bārhaspatya sūtra^565<BR>that Kāñcī is a Śākta-kṣetra. In the Devībhāgavata^566, Kāñcī<BR>is said to be a sthāna of the Devī called Annapūrṇā.^567 The<BR>Vāmana Purāṇa^568 mentions it as the best among the cities.<BR>The Skandapurāṇa^569 counts it amongst the holy places. The<BR>Bhāgavatapurāṇa^570 and the Yoginītantra^571 also mention it.<BR>In Daśakumāracaritam^572 it is referred to as a city of the Drāviḍa<BR>country.<BR>Kāñcī is full of temples and shrines. Śiva Kāñcī and Viṣṇu<BR>Kāñcī form the western and eastern parts of the city, while<BR>the Jaina Kāñcī is known as Tiruparutti-Kunram.^573 Of the<BR>temples at Conjeevaram, the most famous are the Kāmākṣī<BR>temple with a Cakra placed in front of the deity, the Vaikuṇṭha<BR>Perumal temple of Viṣṇu and the Śhiva temple of Kailā-<BR>śanātha.^574<BR>Apart from its religious significance Kāñcī has been a<BR>famous centre of learning. The Pallava ruler Mahendravarman,<BR>the author of the Mattavilāsa-Prahasana; Bhāravi, the author<BR>of the Kirātārjunīyam and Daṇḍin, the author of the Daśakumār-<BR>acaritam are said to have flourished here.^575<BR>The famous Buddhist dialectician Dinnāga came here to<BR>satisfy his intellectual and spiritual thirst and about the middle<BR>of the fourth century A.D., the brāhmaṇa Mayūraśaraman,<BR>who founded the Kadamba line came here for getting recogni-<BR>tion in Vedic learning.^576 The Ādi-guru Śaṅkarācārya establi-<BR>shed here the famous Pīṭha known as Kāmakotipīṭha.^577<BR>Literally Kāñcī means a ‘girdle’.

5. Kāśī (No. 28, L. 6):<BR>It is mentioned in Inscription No. 28. According to the in-<BR>scription a vihāra at Vaṭa-gohālī was inhabited by the disciples<BR>of the Nigrantha preceptor (Śramaṇācārya) Guhanandin,<BR>belonging to the Pañca-stūpa section (nikāya) of Kāśī.^578<BR>Evidently Vaṭagohālī was a seat of Jain monks who had their<BR>major seat at Kāśī.<BR>The name Kāśī is derived from the root Kaś ‘to shine’.<BR>The Skandapurāṇa^579 says that the city of Kāśī became famous<BR>by that name because it sheds light on (the way to) nirvāṇa or<BR>because, that indescribable refulgence, viz. god Śiva shines<BR>forth here.^580 B.C. Law connects it with Ti-miao meaning ‘read<BR>sprouts’, a Chinese translation of the word and this links it<BR>with a certain kind of grass.^581 It has been known for centuries<BR>under five different names, viz., Vārāṇasī (modern Banaras),<BR>Kāśī, Avimukta, Ānandakānana and Śmaśāna or Mahāśma-<BR>śāna.^582<BR>The earliest mention of the Kāśīs as a tribal people occurs<BR>in the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda.^583 Vārāṇasī<BR>was the capital of the people of Kāśī.^584 Thus it seems that<BR>geographically Kāśī represented a larger area than Vārāṇasī, the<BR>latter being the capital of the former. But in medieval times<BR>the position became just the reverse. Vārāṇasī comprehended<BR>the entire district and Kāśī generally represented only a small<BR>place. In a grant of Mahārāja Vināyakapāla we get a reference<BR>to a village of Tikkarikā situated in the Pratiṣṭhāna-bhukti,<BR>and attached to Kāśī-pāra-Pathaka which belonged to Vārāṇasī<BR>viṣaya.^585 Kāśī pāra-pathaka represented the site of the ancient<BR>city of the Kāśī.^586 The Vividhatīrthakalpa^587 also mentions<BR>Kāśī as a janapada in the Vārāṇasī City.<BR>The ancient kingdom of Kāśī was bounded by Kośala on the<BR>north, Magadha on the east, and Vatsa on the west. The<BR>Cedis and Karuṣas lived to their south.^588 At the time of<BR>Buddha, the kingdom of Kāśī was absorbed by the kingdom of<BR>Kośala.^589<BR>We know that Lord Buddha gave his first discourse near<BR>Kāśī in the Deer Park at Sārnāth. Kāśī was an important<BR>Buddhist centre and was a seat of monastic establishments in<BR>the time of Aśoka.^590 During the period of Gupta rule it was<BR>on its way to become a strong centre of Śiva worship with the<BR>mahāliṅgas set up in different parts of the city.^591 The Purāṇas<BR>include the region in the Gupta empire.^592<BR>It was a great centre of trade and commerce. Patañjali in<BR>his Mahābhāṣya^593 mentions Kāśī cloth. The Buddhist litera-<BR>ture gives us many accounts of the merchants of the city.^594<BR>Kāśī has been a place of much importance for Hindu pil-<BR>grimage. Its religious importance has been discussed at length<BR>in the Kāśīkhaṇḍa of the Skanda Purāṇa. Lord Śiva never<BR>leaves it, hence it is known as Avimukta.

6. Kosala (No. 1, L. 19):<BR>It is spelt both ways with the dental as well as with the palatal<BR>sibilant. It is included in the list of the Dakṣiṇāpatha kingdoms<BR>whose kings were conquered but reinstated by Samudragupta.<BR>At that time Mahendra was its ruler. It has been identified<BR>with South Kosala corresponding to modern district of Raipur,<BR>Sambalpur and Bilaspur of M.P. and Orissa.^596 Its old capital<BR>was Śrīpura (modern Sirpur), 40 miles north-east of Raipur.^597 It<BR>is the same as Mahā-kosala^598 which forms the largest unit among<BR>the three component parts of the State of Madhya Pradesh.^599<BR>The recent excavation at Eraṇ has thrown a flood of new light<BR>on the early history of eastern Malwa and Mahākosala between<BR>the period 1900 B.C. and A.D. 600. During the Gupta period<BR>several Brahmanical temples were built in this region. In the<BR>early medieval period i. e. from A.D. 600 to 1200, the Candellas<BR>and Kalacuris were the two chief ruling dynasties in the<BR>Mahākosala area. In the period of Muslim rule followed by<BR>Maratha supremacy, many forts and fortresses were built<BR>by the ruling chiefs^600 in different parts of Mahākosala.<BR>Dakṣiṇa Kosala is mentioned in the Ratnāvalī (Act IV) as<BR>having been conquered by Udayana, king of Vatsa.^601<BR>N.L. Dey^602 identifies Dakṣiṇa Kosala with Tosalī of<BR>Aśoka's inscription (Tosala) at Dhauli, which is situated near<BR>Bhuvaneśwar in the Puri district, Orissa. Sylvain Levi suggests<BR>an Austric origin for this wold. ‘Kosala changing to Tosala is<BR>an apparent variation of the initial due to the formative<BR>prefix’^603 in the Austric languages. The country of Tosala also,<BR>like Kosala, had two divisions: Uttara Tosala and Dakṣiṇa<BR>Tosala.^604 Dakṣiṇa Tosala consisted of a maṇḍala of the name<BR>of Koṅgoda. In some cases by mistake the reading Dakṣiṇa<BR>kosala is given in place of Dakṣiṇa Tosala.^605 But it is clear<BR>from other evidence that Tosala and Kosala were two separate<BR>entities. The purāṇas mention them separately.^606 The Kāvya-<BR>mīmāṃṣā also makes a separate reference to the two.^607<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=257&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=450" target="_blank">Correction</a>

Retaining only the control of its internal ad-<BR>ministration, he had to pay various kinds of taxes to Samudra-<BR>gupta, attend his durbars, render obeisance to him and gratify<BR>his imperious commands.^647 Samataṭa is the only territory in<BR>Bengal to be referred to in the Allahabed Praśasti.^648 The<BR>first epigraphic reference to Samataṭa is to be found in this<BR>inscription.^649 Literally the name means ‘the shore country’<BR>or ‘Level country’.^650 ‘Samataṭa in the Gupta period denoted<BR>a territory lying to the east of the Brahmaputra’. The Bṛhat-<BR>saṃhitā mentions it as a country situated in the East.^651 The<BR>Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang proceeded from Kāmarūpa<BR>southwards and after a journey of 1,200 or 1,300 li (6 li-<BR>1 mile) reached the country of Samataṭa. According to him,<BR>this country was on the seaside and was low and moist and<BR>was more than 3,000 li in circuit.^652 From Samataṭa, the<BR>pilgrim journeyed towards the West for over 900 li and<BR>reached Tanmolihti,^653 or Tāmralipta, the modern Tamluk in<BR>the Midnāpur district.^654 Samataṭa, therefore, must have been<BR>the South-eastern part of the Bengal presidency corresponding<BR>to the Dacca, Faridpur, Backerganj, Jessore and Khulna<BR>districts.^655<BR>It is known from the Baghaura Inscription^656 that the<BR>Tipperah district was in Samataṭa. The Ārya-Mañjuśrī Mūla-<BR>kalpa states that Samataṭa was situated to the east of the<BR>Lohitya.^657 The Yādavaprakāśa equates Bhaurika with<BR>Samataṭa.^658<BR>Epigraphical evidence, however, shows that Samataṭa com-<BR>prised the districts of Comilla, Noakhali and Sylhat.^659 Its<BR>capital Karmmanta has been identified with Baḍ-Kāmatā, 12<BR>miles west of Comilla district.^660 After the rule of the Guptas,<BR>Samataṭa was successively under the Khaḍga, Candra, Varman<BR>and Sena dynasties.^661<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=260&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=456" target="_blank">Correction</a>

1. Āryāvartta (No. 1, L. 12):<BR>Samudragupta is stated to have violently exterminated many<BR>kings of Āryāvarta such as Rudradeva, Matila, Nāgadatta,<BR>Candravarman, Gaṇapatināga, Nāgasena, Acyuta, Nandin<BR>and Balavarman.^677 We also find references to Āryāvarta in<BR>other epigraphic records.^678<BR>Literally Āryāvarta^679 means ‘the abode of the Āryas, or<BR>excellent or noble people’. The word ‘Ārya’ here is significant.<BR>It has been interpreted in two ways: some scholars derive<BR>the word Ārya from the root §Ar, to plough, and suggest that<BR>the Vedic Āryans were so called because they despised the<BR>pursuits of agriculture and remained shepherds and hunters.^680<BR>“If Ārya were purely a racial term. a more probable deri-<BR>vation would be Ar, meaning strength or valour, from §ar<BR>to fight, whence we have the name of the Greek war-god Ares,<BR>areios, brave or warlike, perhaps even arete, virtue signifying,<BR>like the Latin virtues, first physical strength and courage and<BR>then moral force and elevation”.^681 “Intrinsically, in its most<BR>fundamental sense, Ārya means an effort or an uprising or<BR>overcoming. The Āryan is he who strives and overcomes all<BR>outside him and within him that stands opposed to the human<BR>advance.”^682 Wilson says that a variety of ancient designations<BR>of which ‘Āria’ is a component element (cf. Ariāna) are con-<BR>nected with the term Ārya. The Zend name for the country<BR>to the west of the Indus was ‘Eriene-veejo’, that is the Sans-<BR>krit Āryāvarta.^683<BR>In defining the boundaries of Āryāvarta, Vasiṣṭha and<BR>Baudhāyana in their Dharmasūtras lay stress on the word<BR>Ārya and explain it to mean śiṣṭa. Patañjali also in his Mahā-<BR>bhāṣya first explains the meaning of śiṣṭa in order to draw<BR>attention to the cultural basis of the name Āryāvarta. He<BR>remarks that correct conduct is found in Āryāvarta and then<BR>mentions its boundaries.^684<BR>In the Brāhmaṇa period the centre of Āryan culture and ci-<BR>vilization shifted to the Gangetic Doab “Āryāvarta came to be<BR>treated as conterminous with the region between the Gaṅgā<BR>and Yamunā.^685 In the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka^686 special honour<BR>is assigned to those who dwell between the Gaṅgā and the<BR>Yamunā. In the Śutra period Āryāvarta extended from the<BR>hills of Central Rajasthan to the hills of Central Bihar.^687<BR>At the time of Patañjali,^688 Āryāvarta was bounded on the<BR>north by the Himalayas, on the south by Pāriyātraka, on the<BR>west by Ādarśāvalī and on the east by Kālakavana (Rajmahal<BR>hills) ‘Black Forest’ or rather Kanakhala, near Hardwar.^689<BR>Thus it seems that Āryāvarta bore a sacerdotal sense and<BR>denoted a particularly limited area where Āryan institutions<BR>were the basis of social order.^690<BR>What was originally called Āryāvarta was later named as<BR>Madhya-deśa and Āryāvarta came to include the whole of<BR>Northern India. This is related to the gradual spread of Ārya-<BR>nism.^691 Brahmāvarta and Brahmarṣideśa lost their identity in<BR>the Madhya-deśa and combined with Prācya, Pratīcya and<BR>Udīcya (Uttarāpatha) became the equivalent of Āryāvarta.^692<BR>Both Udīcya and Prācya were taken as the home (loka) of<BR>standard Sanskrit both in Pāṇini's time and earlier. In the time<BR>of Patañjali, Āryāvarta came to be regarded as the home of the<BR>Śiṣṭas (persons proficient in the Śāstras) whose language set the<BR>norm.^693<BR>By the second century A.D., the last limit of the composi-<BR>tion of the Manu-smṛti, the wider outlook of Āryāvarta was<BR>popular. It was the name of the tract extending from the<BR>Eastern to the Western Ocean, and bounded on the north and<BR>south by the Himalaya and Vindhya respectively.^694 This is<BR>supported by the Kāvyamīmāṃsā of Rājaśekhara.^695 Rājaśek-<BR>hara speaks of the river Narmadā as the dividing line between<BR>Āryāvarta and the Dakṣiṇāpatha.^696 In Inscription No. 1, L. 29<BR>Āryāvarta is contrasted with Dakṣiṇāpatha, ‘the southern<BR>region’.^697 The wider sense of Āryāvarta is also supported by<BR>references in the Abhidhāna-cintāmaṇi^698 and the Rājataraṅ-<BR>giṇī.^699<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=263&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=464" target="_blank">Correction</a>

2. Kākanādaboṭa (No. 5, L. 1; No. 23, L. 2):<BR>In both the inscriptions, we find reference to a grant to the<BR>Ārya Saṃgha or the Community of the faithful, at the great<BR>Vihāra, or Buddhist convent of Kākanādaboṭa,^700 for the<BR>purpose of feeding mendicants and maintaining lamps.<BR>D.C. Sircar takes ‘Kākanādaboṭa’ to be the old name of<BR>Sāñcī.^701 Fleet is of the view that the Kākanādaboṭa convent<BR>is the Great Stūpa itself. According to him the word Boṭa is<BR>another form of Poṭa which means ‘the foundation of a<BR>house’.^702 Fleet further writes that the name ‘Kākanāda’ lit.<BR>‘the noise of the crow’ was the ancient name of Sāñcī itself<BR>which is proved by its occurrence in two inscriptions in Mauryan<BR>characters found at Sāñcī.^703<BR>Thus, it is clear that Kākanāda was the ancient name of<BR>Sāñcī in the Bhopal State, now Raisen district, Madhya<BR>Pradesh, well-known for its Buddhist topes.^704 The word ‘boṭa’<BR>is thus a surplus and joined by ‘Kākanāda’ will refer to the<BR>great stūpa itself. Its form Poṭa meaning the foundation of a<BR>house is untenable because the word ‘vihāra’ in that very sense<BR>appears in the inscriptions. The word ‘boṭa’ has been used here<BR>in the sense of an ascetic cult.^705 It is a Prakrit word which has<BR>been used here to refer to ‘the Buddhist cult’. Thus the relevant<BR>expression means ‘in the holy great vihāra of the Buddhist cult<BR>(assembly) at Kākanāda’.<BR>Fleet is wrong in translating the word Kākanāda to mean<BR>‘the noise of the crow’.^706 K.P. Jayaswal's rendering ‘the praise<BR>of the Kākas’^707 is more to the point. We know of the Kākas,<BR>an autonomous community mentioned in the Allahabad In-<BR>scription of Samudragupta.^708 In Eastern Malwa we have two<BR>ancient place-names connected with the Kākas. One is the hill<BR>now called Sāñcī hill (the ancient) Kākanāda. The other is an<BR>ancient village called Kāka-pura, some 20 miles north of<BR>Bhilsa, and full of ancient monuments.^709<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=265&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=465" target="_blank">Correction</a>

वङ्ग
4. Vaṅga (No. 20, L.

The<BR>Vaṅgas here mean the ‘Vaṅga country’ the eastern Bengal of<BR>modern times. Bajpai is of the opinion that the Vaṅgas<BR>of the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription of Candra (No. 20) are the<BR>people living in the Makaran coast of Baluchistan.^715 But the<BR>Vaṅgas here denote country and not the people. Moreover, the<BR>victory of king Candra over the Vaṅga countries has no con-<BR>nection with his conquest of the Vāhlikas. Both are separately<BR>mentioned in his campaign. In Sanskrit the tribal name in the<BR>plural is regularly used to indicate the country inhabited by the<BR>tribe.^716 The Vaṅga countries are also referred to in the<BR>Mahākūṭa Pillar Inscription,^717 but in the inscriptions after<BR>the 9th century A.D. the word Vaṅgāla is usually mention-<BR>ed.^718<BR>The earliest mention of the Vaṅgas along with the Magadhas<BR>is in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka.^719 The name is also found in the<BR>Baudhāyana Dharma-Sūtra^720 where the Vaṅgas are mentioned<BR>as impure people.^721 But the Drama ‘Pratijñā-Yaugandha-<BR>rāyaṇa’ (Act II), ascribed to Bhāsa and probably not older<BR>than the 4th century A.D., suggests that the ruling families of<BR>Bengal were regarded as equals to those of Northern India for<BR>intermarriage with the royal family of Mālava.^722<BR>The people of Vaṅga are stated to have fought in the Kuru-<BR>kshetra war^723 and, in course of his expedition Bhīṣma is said<BR>to have defeated Samudrasena of Vaṅga.^724 The Kāśikā men-<BR>tions Vāṅgaka to explain Pāṇini's sūtra (IV. 3. 100) denoting<BR>loyalty of the citizen to the state.^725 Pāṇini mentions Vāṅgī<BR>(the lady of Vaṅga Janapada) along with Avantī, Kurū and<BR>Yaudheyī.^726 Patañjali also refers to the Vaṅgas by way of<BR>illustration.^727 Kauṭilya makes similar references to the<BR>country.^728 The Bhāgavata Purāṇa also mentions it as a<BR>country.^729 Kālidāsa states that Raghu after conquering the<BR>Sumhas,^730 defeated the Vaṅgas with his force.^731 The Kāvya-<BR>mīmāṃsā mentions Vaṅga as a janapada situated in the east.^732<BR>The Bṛhatsaṃhitā also mentions it in the east along with Upa-<BR>Vaṅga.^733<BR>According to the Mahābhārata^734 Vaṅga, son of Bali, had<BR>established this country. The Amarakośa^735 mentions Vaṅga<BR>as a synonym of Raṅga (lead), but lead is not available<BR>in Bengal and is found in abundance in Malaya, Pegu and<BR>East Indies. People in other parts of India may have received<BR>lead through the people of East Bengal. Suśruta also uses<BR>Vaṅga in the same sense as Amara does^736<BR>R.C. Banerji^737, on the basis of the Ablur Inscription of the<BR>Kalacuri king Bijjala^738 takes Vaṅga and Vaṅgāla as two dis-<BR>tinct people or tribes. This view has been correctly refuted by<BR>S.B. Chaudhuri^739 who concludes that Vaṅgāla was within Vaṅga<BR>and hence was not altogether a separate geographical entity<BR>as is maintained by some.<BR>The confusion may be due to the fact that the geographi-<BR>cal location of the Vaṅga country changed in different periods.<BR>The same country Vaṅga was known as Vaṅgāla with the addi-<BR>tion of the Prakrit suffix ‘āla’^740 which was transliterated by the<BR>Muslims as Bangālah (pronouncing Bangāla) in their script^741<BR>and this was changed into Bengal by the English people.<BR>The Yādavaprakāśa equates Vaṅga with Harikeli^742 but<BR>the Kalpadrukośa, a work of the seventeenth century states that<BR>Śrīhaṭṭa is Harikeli.^743 The commentary of Yaśodhara on the<BR>Kāmasūtra refers to Vaṅga as situated to the east of the<BR>Brahmaputra.^744<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=266&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=467" target="_blank">Correction</a>

7. Palāśinī^40 (No. 14, L. 16):<BR>This river Palāśinī issues from the mountain Raivataka. On<BR>account of the flood it had swollen. The poet, in describing<BR>the scene says that the river had gone to join the sea. Palāśinī<BR>is described as emanating from the mountain Ūrjayat (i. e. the<BR>same as Raivataka).^41 We find another Palāśinī, (mod. Parās),<BR>a tributary of the Koel in Choṭānagpur.^42 It seems that the<BR>river was decorated with numerous Palāśa (flower) trees that<BR>grew on its banks. The flowers falling in the river must have<BR>given it the name of Palāśinī.^43<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=295&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=474" target="_blank">Correction</a>

8.

The second part has<BR>been replaced by a new one. The exact derivative as suggested<BR>by Chatterji will be a form like Sonasītā or Sonasī.^48 The river<BR>was named Suvarṇasikatā because its sand contains particles of<BR>gold.^49<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=295&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=475" target="_blank">Correction</a>

9. Sindhu (No. 20, L. 2):<BR>The river is mentioned in connexion with the description of<BR>the victories of king Candra who is said to have conquered the<BR>Vāhlikas after having crossed the seven mouths of the (river)<BR>Sindhu^50 in warfare. Sindhu in the Ṛgveda^51 and the Athar-<BR>vaveda^52 often means simply a ‘stream’. The Ṛgveda (VIII.<BR>24. 27) refers to ‘Sapta Sindhavaḥ’ or ‘the seven rivers’.^53 But<BR>it is also^54 used in the more exact sense of the ‘stream’ par<BR>excellence or ‘The Indus’. We get a reference to Sindhu as a<BR>river in the Amara-kośa.^55 The territories adjoining it were<BR>famous for horses^56 and salt.^57<BR>The term Sindhu was corrupted to Hindu in the old Per-<BR>sian inscriptions of Darius I (516-485 B.C.), and to Indus by<BR>the Ionian (= Pāṇini's Yavana) Greeks.^58 The word ‘India’ is<BR>derived from the river Sindhu or the Indus.^59 Taking its rise<BR>from the snows of Western Kailāśa in Tibet, the Sindhu first<BR>flows north-west of Kashmir and South of little Pamir, and<BR>then takes a southward course along which lay some of the<BR>important cities of north India. Emerging from the Darad<BR>high-lands, the river (Dāradī Sindhuḥ) enters the Gandhāra<BR>country until it receives its most important western tributary<BR>the Kabul river at Ohind, a few miles north of Attock.^60<BR>The river Sindhu is mentioned in the Purāṇas along with<BR>the Gaṅgā, Sarasvatī, Satluj, Chinab and Yamunā.^61<BR>Vogel suggests that the expression ‘Sindhor sapta mukhāni’<BR>may indicate the ‘sapta sindhavaḥ’ of the Ṛgveda, i. e. the<BR>river Indus and its tributaries. The term mukha would then<BR>be not taken in the sense of ‘the mouth of a river’, but as<BR>meaning a river-head.^62 But the translation of the expression<BR>as done by Fleet (i. e. the seven mouths of the river Indus) is<BR>generally accepted.^63 The seven mouths of the river Indus<BR>thus represent the points of its confluence with its tributaries<BR>and not the tributaries individually as suggested by Vogel.<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=296&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=476" target="_blank">Correction</a>

10. Sudarśana (No. 14, L. 15: L. 17):<BR>It is the name of a lake situated at some distance from<BR>Girinagara as mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of<BR>Rudradāman I (A.D. 150).^64 The lake was originally cons-<BR>tructed by the Vaiśya Puṣyagupta, the provincial governor of<BR>the Maurya king Candragupta. Later on during the reign of<BR>Aśoka it was adorned with conduits, by the Yavana governor<BR>Tuṣāspha.^65 The same lake was destroyed by the excessive<BR>floods in the Suvarṇasikatā, Palāśinī and other streams arising<BR>from the mountain Ūrjayat.^66 By a breach, four hundred and<BR>twenty cubits long, just as much broad, (and) seventy-five<BR>cubits deep, all the water flowed out, so that, the lake, almost<BR>like a sandy desert became extremely ugly to look at.^67 The<BR>lake was immediately beautified with repairs by king Rudradā-<BR>man.^68<BR>Inscription No. 14 informs us that during the reign of<BR>Gupta king Skandagupta in the year 136 (G. E.), due to heavy<BR>continuous rains the Sudarśana lake burst out on all sides^69<BR>and had the appearance of a sea. Eventually, contrary to the<BR>literal meaning of its name the Sudarśana became ugly to look<BR>at.^70 The lake was repaired in the year 137 (G. E.)^71 (= A.D.<BR>456) by Cakrapālita, who was appointed governor of Giri-<BR>nagara by his father Parṇadatta, who was Skandagupta's<BR>viceroy in Surāṣṭra.^72<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=297&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=477" target="_blank">Correction</a>

2.

Its other names<BR>are Meru, Karṇikācala, Ratnasānu, Svargiri, Svargigiri and<BR>Kāñcanagiri.^92<BR>Sumeru is identified with Rudra Himālaya in Garhwal,<BR>where the river Gaṅgā has its source, it is near Badarikāśrama.^93<BR>According to the Matsya Purāṇa^94 the Sumeru Parvata is<BR>bounded on the north by Uttara-Kuru, on the South by<BR>Bhāratavarṣa, on the west by Ketumāla and on the east by<BR>Bhadrāśvavarṣa.^95 It is also mentioned in the Padmapurāṇa.^96<BR>and the Kālikāpurāṇa.^97 According to the Kālikāpurāṇa Śiva saw<BR>the summit of it.

4. Ūrjayat (No. 14, L. 16):<BR>The poet here draws a picture: the lake Sudarśana looked<BR>like the sea^101 and the rivers Palāśinī, (Suvarṇasikatā), etc.,<BR>had joined it has if the mountain Ūrjayat had stretched his<BR>hand with flowers (growing on the banks of the trees and thus<BR>falling in the rivers) for sending his daughters to their worthy<BR>husband.^102 Since the rivers emerged out from the mountain<BR>Raivataka, it may be called their father as described in verse<BR>28, but to avoid repetition the poet uses in verse 29 a synonym<BR>of its name viz., the Ūrjayat and while making it the symbol<BR>of father represents the sea as the husband of the rivers.^103<BR>Thus the mountains Ūrjayat and the Raivataka are one and<BR>the same. We also get support for our suggestion from the<BR>fact that whereas the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradā-<BR>man describes the emergence of the rivers Palāśinī, Suvarṇsi-<BR>katā etc., from the mountain Ūrjayat^104 in Inscription No. 14<BR>the name of Raivataka is used in the same context.^105 Fleet^106<BR>and Sircar^107 are wrong in describing Raivataka as a hill diff-<BR>erent from Ūrjayat or Girnar situated opposite to it. The<BR>Vividhatīrthakalpa also uses the names Raivataka and the<BR>Ujjayant (Ūrjayat) as synonyms for Girinara which was sancti-<BR>fied by Śrīnemi and is situated in Surāṣṭra (South Kathia-<BR>wad).^108 In another inscription at Girnār (about 15th century)<BR>verses 5-8 refer to the mountain Girnār by both the names<BR>Ujjayanata and Raivata.^109 The Abhidhānacintāmaṇi of<BR>Hemacandra also mentions Ujjayanta and Raivataka as<BR>synonyms.^110 The Kap copper-plate of Keṭadi Sadāśiva-Nāyaka<BR>also refers to Ujjantagiri (Ūrjayat).^111 The mountain Ūrjayat<BR>is identified with Girnar hill near Junāgaṛh.^112 The literal<BR>meaning of Ūrjayat is strong, powerful, eminent.^113<BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?cp=299&d=PGN" target="_blank">PDF</a><BR><a href="https://yaahi.github.io/?d=pgn&e=483" target="_blank">Correction</a>
