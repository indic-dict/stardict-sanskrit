1. Gupta: (No. 1, L. 28; No. 21, L. 4; No. 22, L. 1; No. 47, L. 1; No. 49, L. 1; No. 50, L. 1; No. 51, L. 2, L. 4; No. 53, L. 1): He was the founder of the family. We have already discussed his name.

घटोत्कच
2. Ghaṭotkaca: (No. 1, L. 28; No. 47, L. 1; No. 53, LL. 1-2; No. 46, L. 1; No. 49, L. 1; No. 50, L. 1; No 40, L. 3; No. 21, L. 4: The inscriptions name Mahārājā Ghaṭotkaca as the successor of Gupta. He should not be confused with Ghaṭotkacagupta whose name occurs on some seals found at Vaīśālī, and also in the Tumain Inscription of Kumāragupta and Ghaṭotkacagupta (G. E. 116).^46 Ghaṭotkaca was the name of a son of Bhīma-sena by the Rākṣasī Hiḍimbā.^47 Names based on Ghaṭa are very rare in Sanskrit literature. Thus Gaṇeśa is named Ghaṭodara ‘potbellied’.^48 The name Ghaṭotkaca refers to the practice of bearing traditional names based on Epics and Purāṇas. Derivatively it means a person having a hairless head.^49 In Prācīna Caritrakośa it has been suggested that Ghaṭotkaca was so called as his head was like a ghaṭa (pitcher) and was hairless.^50 Tripathi suggests on the basis of the Skanda Purāṇa that Ghaṭotkaca was so called as he produced a loud voice while laughing which may be compared to the voice produced by thumping the pitcher quite aloud at its mouth by hands.^51 But the first derivation seems to be more plausible from linguistic point of view^52 while the other explanation may be more important from socio-psychological or mythological point of view. It is possible that it was the nickname of Ghaṭotkaca which might have become his famous name.

3. Candragupta I: (No. 47, L. 2; No. 53, L. 2; No. 40, L. 3; No. 21, L. 5; No. 1, L. 28; No. 30, L. 1): While his two predecessors are each given the title of Mahārāja, Candragupta I is described in the inscriptions as Mahārājādhirāja, ‘king of kings’. Mookerjee connects the passage from the Purāṇas defining the extent of the Gupta territory with the period before Samudragupta, i.e., under Candragupta I.^53 It has been suggested that Caṇḍasena of the play ‘KaumudīMahotsava’ is to be identified with Candragupta I. The Licchavi alliance is the common point in the account given by the drama and the inscriptions.^54 Other details of the drama, however, do not support this identification. The drama condemns Caṇḍasena as an usurper and belonging to low caste whom the citizens of Magadha could not tolerate and drove out to die in exile. Linguistically also Caṇḍasena and Candragupta are different names. Candra can become Caṇḍa in Prakrit but Gupta cannot be transformed into Sena. Moreover, in the fifth act of the play we are informed through a character Lokākṣī that the cursed Caṇḍasena has been killed and his royal family uprooted.^55 Thus we know about the total annihilation of the dynasty after the death of Caṇḍasena which is not applicable to the dynasty of Caṇḍragupta which ruled for several generations after him.^56 The name of the deity Candra ‘moon’ has been given to this king; Gupta is the surname. It may refer to his handsome physical features.

4. Samudragupta (No. 1, L. 29; No. 47, L. 3; No. 53, L. 3; No. 21, LL. 6-7; No. 2, L. 10; No. 40, L. 4; No. 41, L. 1; No. 10, L. 4; No. 49, L. 3; No. 50, L. 3; No. 13, L. 4; No. 12, L. 19): He is introduced as Mahārājādhirāja in all references except the Mathurā Pillar Inscription of Candragupta II, G.E. 61^57 where he is mentioned as Bhaṭṭārakamahārāja rājādhirāja. He was the daughter's son of the Licchavis, and son of Mahārājā dhirāja Śrī Candragupta I born on the queen Kumāradevī.^58 He has been mentioned as a ‘Paramabhāgavata’ (a devout devotee of Lord Viṣṇu).^59 No. 2, L. 10 gives the justification of his name Samudragupta.^60 Mookerji says that the name Samudragupta was probably a title assumed after his conquests. It means ‘protected by the sea’ and may refer to his dominion which extended upto the sea. The Mathurā Inscription of Candragupta II actually describes the fame of his conquests as extending up to the four oceans (caturudadhisalilāsvāditayaśasaḥ). The name Samudragupta may be split up into two parts, Samudra being his personal name, and Gupta being his surname. This is supported by the fact that the obverse of his coins of standard type sometimes bears the legend ‘Samudra’ while the reverse has ‘Parākramaḥ’ as his title. The name ‘Samudra’ also appears on some other types of his coins, such as the Archer type and Battle-Axe type.^61 Mookerji^62 holds that Samudragupta's personal name was Kāca and that Samudragupta was his title. But the identification of Kāca with Samudragupta has been rightly opposed by scholars.^63 Vāmana in his Kāvyalaṁkāra^64 refers to Candraprakāśa as the son of Candragupta which Goyal takes to be another name of Samudragupta.^65 But it seems to be the name of a local king of Ayodhyā rather than that of a member of the Imperial Gupta dynasty.^66 Another probable and most suitable explanation of the name ‘Samudragupta’ may be ‘protected by Lord Śiva’, Samudra being an epithet of Śiva.^67 Samudragupta is given many epithets in No. 1. Some of these are also supported by numismatic evidence.^68

5. Candragupta II: (No. 30, L. 1, L. 2; No. 32, L. 2; No. 47, L. 4; No. 3, L. 1; No. 7, L. 1; No. 6, L. 1; No. 7, L. 10; No. 46, L. 3; No. 53, L. 4; No. 42, L. 1; No. 47, L. 4; No. 41, L. 2; No. 39, L. 1, L. 6; No. 5. L. 3, L. 7; No. 20, L. 5): He is mentioned as ‘apratiratha’, ‘paramabhāgavata’ ‘mahārājādhirāja’ and a son of mahārājādhirāja Śrī Samudragupta born of his chief queen Dattadevī;^69 or as Bhaṭṭāraka-mahārājādhirāja, the good son of the Bhaṭṭāraka-mahārājādhirāja, the illustrious Samudragupta;^70 or in one case simply as a king (rājā) in No. 30, L. 1. In No, 46, L. 3, L. 4. his title is ‘Vikramāditya’. He is mentioned by other names as well. Devarāja as his favourite name (priyanāma) is mentioned in No. 5, L. 7.^71 In the Poona copper plate inscription of Prabhāvatīguptā and the Ridhapura grants of Prabhāvatīguptā her father's name is Candragupta.^72 The Chammak copper plate inscription of Vākāṭaka king Pravarasena II, however, names Prabhāvatīguptā's father as Devagupta.^73 This proves that Devagupta was another name of Candragupta. Candragupta had a third name, Deva-Śrī, which appears on his Archer and Conch-types of Coins.^74 No. 32, L. 2 Justifies his name Candragupta ‘who is like a moon in the galaxy of Gupta kings with the famous name Candragupta’.^75 No. 20, L. 5 refers to his quality of handsomeness. ‘His name was Candra and he was holding the glory of a full moon on his face’.^76

गोविन्दगुप्त
6. Govindagupta: (No. 42, L. 2; No. 32, L. 3): In No. 42, he is mentioned as the son of Candragupta II. His mother's name was Dhruvasvāminī. No. 32 explains the basis of his name: “The lord of the earth, i.e. king Candragupta, produced a son whose exalted name was Govindagupta, who was as famous as Govinda (Viṣṇu) for the glory of his virtues, and who resembled the sons of Diti and Aditi, i.e. the demons and gods.”^77 The poet means that Govindagupta resembled demons in physical strength and valour, and gods in spiritual virtues. Govindagupta probably ruled as emperor between (his father) Candragupta II and (his younger brother) Kumāragupta 1. His reign could not have been more than three years, the interval between the last known date of Candragupta II (G. E. 93) and the earliest known date of Kumāragupta I (G.E. 96).^78 P. L. Gupta assigns his short regnal period between A.D. 412 and 415.^79 That Govindagupta could have ruled as emperor only for a very short period is also evident from the fact that he has left no coins. Being a collateral, Govindagupta does not appear in the genealogical table in the inscriptions of Kumāragupta and his successors.^80 It is also likely that Kumāragupta defeated or ousted Govindagupta and seized the throne; and after his accession, avoided all references to his elder brother.^81

कुमारगुप्त
7. Kumāragupta I: (No. 30, L. 2; No. 53, L. 5; No. 49, L. 5; No. 50, L. 5; No. 39, L. 7; No. 17, L. 13; No. 30, L. 4; No. 31, L. 1; No. 39, L. 3; No. 46, L. 4; No. 35, LL. 1-2; No. 34, L. 2): No. 30, L. 2 says that Śrī Candragupta's son Kumārgupta resembled the great Indra (Mahendra), who embraced and protected the whole earth.^82 In No. 53, L. 5 Kumāragupta is mentioned as ‘Mahārājādhirāja’ son of ‘paramabhāgavata Mahārājādhirāja Śrī Candragupta’ born of the cheif queen Dhruvadevī. He has been mentioned as father of Pūrugupta and son of Candragupta II.^83 In No. 30, L. 4 Kumāragupta is described as shining (ruling) over the earth like the Sun in the winter. He is called ‘Paramabhaṭṭāraka’ and ‘Mahārājādhirāja’ in No. 31, L. 1. In No. 46, L. 4 he is mentioned only by his title ‘Mahendrāditya’, and as the grandson of Samudragupta and son of Candragupta II. The Ārya-Mañju-Śrī-Mūlakalpa corroborates the title giving his name as Mahendra.^84 In No. 34, L. 2 he is mentioned as ‘Paramadaivata’, ‘Parmabhaṭṭāraka’ and ‘Mahārājādhirāja’. Of the two parts of his name Kumāra is the name of god Skanda (or Kārttikeya)^85 and Gupta was his surname.

स्कन्दगुप्त
8. Skandagupta (No. 15, L. 3; No. 46, LL. 7-8; No. 14, L. 3; No. 16, L. 3; No. 13, L. 8; No. 12, LL. 6, 11, 23, 25): In No. 15 he is equated with Indra.^86 In No. 46 he is described as equal to the Cakravartins in prowess and valour, to Rāma in righteousness and to Yudhiṣṭhira in the matter of speaking the truth and in good conduct and modesty.^87 According to some scholars^88 these are vague praises; but in view of his achievements these epithets seem to be richly deserved. In No. 14, L. 2 he is described as ‘rājarājādhirāja’, and as ‘Paramabhāgavata’ and ‘Mahārājādhirāja’ in No. 12, LL. 23, 25. The name is based on god Skanda which is a synonym of Kārttikeya.

पूरुगुप्त
9. Pūrugupta (No. 47, L. 6; No. 53, L. 6; No. 49, L. 6; No. 50, L. 6; No. 38, L. 1): We know from No. 53 that Mahārājādhirāja Śrī Pūrugupta was the son of Mahārājādhirāja Śrī Kumāragupta by his chief queen Anantadevī. In No. 38, L. 1 the name of the father and predecessor of Narasiṁhagupta is spelt as Pūrugupta.^89 The reading Pūrugupta is unmistakeable on the fragmentary Nālandā Seal of Narasiṁhagupta and is also fairly clear on the seals of Kumāragupta II. The medial ū sign in the first letter of the name Pūrugupta is indicated by an additional stroke attached to the base of the letter and the downward elongation of its right limb; mere elongation of the right limb by itself would have denoted the short medial u as in puttras in LL. 2 and 3. In the second letter of the name, viz. ru. the medial u is shown by a small hook turned to left and joined to the foot of r. Palaeographical considerations apart, the name Purugupta yields a more plausible-sense than Puragupta and fits better in the series of the grand and dignified names of the Gupta kings. The first part of the Gupta names constituted the real or substantive name and yielded satisfactory meaning independently of the latter half, viz. gupta, which being family surname was a mere adjunct. Pura, by itself is neither a complete nor a dignified name while Puru is both. Pūru or its variant Puru may, like Vainya in Vainyagupta signify the homonymous epic hero of the lunar race who was the ancestor of the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas, or may mean abundant or great.^90

कुमारगुप्त
10. Kumāragupta II: (No. 48, L. 5): Kumāragupta II was the immediate successor of Pūrugupta in the light of the data given in two dated inscriptions, viz. the Sarnath Buddha Stone Image inscriptions of Kumāragupta and Budhagupta. The first (No. 48) mentions A.D. 473 as the date of Kumāragupta who must, therefore, be taken as Kumāragupta II and the second (No. 54) mentions A.D. 476 as the date of Budhagupta. No. 48 records the date, Gupta year 154^91 when Kumāragupta was protecting the earth.^92 The renovation of the Sun temple mentioned in No 17, LL. 20-21 seems to have taken place in his reign.^93 It seems that Mookerji has by mistake, connected the reference^94 meant for Kumāragupta I with Kumāragupta II.^95 The temple was originally constructed in the reign of Kumāragupta I in M.S. 493 = A.D. 436 (L. 19).

बुधगुप्त
11. Budhagupta: (No. 54, L. 1; No. 55, L. 2; No. 18, L. 2; No. 33, L. 1; No. 53, L. 8): Nos. 54, 55, 18 and 33 respectively mention him as reigning in: G.Y. 157, 159, 163 and 165. No. 33 gives his titles as ‘paramadaivata’, ‘paramabhaṭṭāraka’ and ‘mahārājādhirāja’. In No. 53 he is mentioned as the son of Pūrugupta born of the queen Candradevī.^96 In No. 55 his title is Mahārājādhirāja. According to Sircar there is no space for the name of any other Gupta prince between Pūrugupta and Bhudhagupta and their relationship is clearly mentioned by the word ‘putra’ occurring at the end of line 6.^97 In other words pūrugupta was the father of Budhagupta. In his description of Nālandā, Hiuen Tsang says that the monastic establishments at that place were enriched by the successive endowments of Śakrāditya, Budhagupta, Tathāgatagupta and Bālāditya.^98 On the strength of this statement it has been suggested that Budhagupta was the son of Kumāragupta I who had the title of Mahendrāditya (Mahendra = Śakra).^99 In veiw of the clear epigraphic reference to the parentage of Budhagupta the proposed identification must be rejected.^100 The statement of Hiuen Tsang was based on hearsay and not on sound history, or else his Budhagupta is not to be identified with Budhagupta of the Imperial Gupta line. The name Budhagupta is based on Mercury. Budhism had quite a prominent place in the time of Budhagupta. But in view of the special leaning of Gupta kings towards the brahmanical faith we prefer to interpret Budha as referring to Mercury either as god Mercury (regarded as a son of Soma or the Moon) or as the planet Mercury.^101

नरसिंहगुप्त
12. Narasiṁhagupta: (No. 47, L. 8; No. 49, L. 7; No. 50, L. 7; No. 38, L. 2): Narasiṁhagupta has been mentioned as ‘Paramabhāgavata’ and ‘Mahārājādhirāja’. Hiranand Shastri^102 says that the seal of Narasiṁhagupta (No. 47), though not entire is valuable in establishing his identity as the son of Pūrugupta born of the the queen consort Śrī Vainyadevī and not Vatsadevī as has hitherto been believed. But the correct reading of the name of her mother is Śrī Candradevī, on his seal.^103 In No. 50. L. 6 we find his mother's name as ‘Vatsadevī’. In No. 49 he is mentioned as the father of Kumāragupta III. No. 38 describes the issuer of this seal, Viṣṇugupta, as the son and successor of Kumāragupta III, who in his turn was the son and successor of Narasiṁhagupta. Narasiṁha is the name of Viṣṇu in his fourth incarnation (Avatāra), half man and half lion who slew the demon Hiraṇyakaśipu and saved the life of Prahlāda.^104

कुमारगुप्त
13. Kumāragupta III: (No. 49, L. 8; No. 50, L. 8; No. 38. L. 3; No. 47, L. 5): Kumāragupta mentioned in Nos. 49 (L. 8); 50 (L. 8); 38 (L. 3); 47 (L. 5) should be considered as Kumārgupta III. He is described as the son and successor of Narasiṁhagupta and has been given the title of Mahārājādhirāja.

विष्णुगुप्त
14. Viṣṇugupta (No. 38, L. 4): Viṣṇugupta is mentioned here as a Paramabhāgavata and Mahārājādhirāja. He was the son and successor of Kumāragupta III who in his turn was the son and successor of Narasiṁhagupta. Unfortunately the name of the mother of Viṣṇugupta (and the wife of Kumārgupta III) has been lost in the portion of the last line. The Kalighat hoard^105 contained besides Candragupta II's coins those of Narasiṁhagupta, Kumāragupta III and Viṣṇugupta. Altekar identified Viṣṇugupta of the coins with the homonymous ruler of the later Gupta family of Magadha, who flourished in the eighth century A.D.^106 At that time the learned professor had no knowledge of this seal of an earlier Viṣṇugupta. His name is clearly based on god Viṣṇu. B. Other members of the Dynasty

घटोत्कचगुप्त
1. Ghaṭotkacagupta: (No. 45, L. 1; No. 30, L. 3): Ghaṭotkacagupta of No. 30 is identical wlth that of No. 45. A distinction must be made between Ghaṭotkacagupta and Ghaṭotkaca, the latter being the grandfather of Samudragupta. Unfortunately the word expressing the exact relationship between Kumāragupta (the ruling emperor) and Ghaṭotkacagupta (the provincial governor) is lost in the missing protion of the inscription. He was probably a son or younger brother of Kumāragupta I^107 and may have been one of the claimants for the throne after the death of Kumāragupta I. Altekar considers him to be a brother of Kumāragupta.^108

वैन्यगुप्त
2. Vainyagupta: (No. 51, L. 5; No. 52, L. 1): Vainya is the synonym for the first king ‘Pṛthu’.^109 Hiranand Shastri mentions Vainya as a synonym of Kubera, the god of wealth. According to Sir Richard Burn Vainya was another name of Vajra whom Hiuen Tsang mentions as the son of Bālāditya. He chiefly relies on the St. Petersburg dictionary where Vainya is derived from Vena and is connected with Indra; Vajra is the thunderbolt and Vainya is a patronymic from Vena who is Indra.^110 But the suggested identification is extremely far-fetched. Vajra cannot by any stretch of imagination be described as a synonym of Vainya. Moreover, it is difficult to believe that Hiuen Tsang would have referred to the king by such a name in preference of the real name. In No. 51 Vainyagupta is mentioned as a paramabhāgavata and mahārājādhirāja, but in No. 53 he is described as a devotee of Lord Śiva (bhagavān mahādevapādānudhyāta) and a mahārāja only. Some scholars hold the opinion that it shall be wrong to disconnect Vainyagupta from the Gupta family on the basis of the argument that the Guptas were Vaiṣṇavas while Vainyagupta professed to be a Śaiva.^111 We find both the epithets ‘paramabhāgavata’ and ‘mahādevapādānudhyāta’ for him in our records. It is interesting that even his Pādadāsa and Uparika are styled as mahārājas (LL. 3 and 16). His title Mahārāja, therefore, cannot prove that Vainyagupta was an insignificant prince.^112 The legend on No. 51, though partially preserved, resembles in point of style the legend on the other seals of the Imperial Guptas. Here Vainyagupta is specifically called paramabhāgavata. Moreover, his name, like those of other kings in the Gupta dynasty ends in the word Gupta. It is thus clear that Vainyagupta belonged to the line of the Imperial Guptas. He seems to have ruled in any case over considerable parts of Bengal and Bihar^113 almost immediately after Budhagupta. We do not know anything about the relationship of Vainyagupta with Budhagupta and Bhānugupta of the Eraṇ Inscription of A.D. 510.^114 Some scholars assign him a reign of four years before Bhānugupta (A.D. 510).^115 The regnal period of Vainyagupta witnessed a considerable decline in the power and prestige of the Imperial Guptas. The rise of the ruling dynasty consisting of Dharmāditya, Gopacandra and Samācāradeva in Central and South-West Bengal in the first half of the sixth Century A.D., possibly points to the extirpation of Gupta rule from Bengal excepting the bhukti (province) of Puṇḍravardhana (North Bengal).^116

भानुगुप्त
3. Bhānugupta (No. 19, L. 5): He is known only from No. 19. His no other coin or seal has yet come to light. As regards the position of Bhānugupta, several alternatives are possible. First, he may have been a successor of Vainyagupta and the dominions of both may have included parts of Eastern Malwa. Second, Vainyagupta may have been the lord of the eastern part of the Gupta Empire when its western part was being ruled by Bhānugupta. Third, Bhānugupta may have been a viceroy in the Malwa region like Govindagupta and Ghaṭotkacagupta. It is possible that he belonged to the Imperial Gupta line but whether he succeeded Vainygupta, or the two ruled at the same time respectively over the western and eastern parts of the empire, is difficult to determine. The latter view seems more probable and this internal dissension perhaps paved the way for the downfall of the empire.^117 Bhānugupta, in spite of the high encomiums paid to his bravery in Eraṇ Inscription, remains a shadowy figure, and we do not know what was his position in the Gupta Imperial family, or what part he played in the dark days of the Gupta empire.^118 His name is based on the god Sun ‘Bhānu’. NAMES OF THE GUPTA QUEENS Following are the names of the Gupta queens available in our inscriptions. They have been mentioned as Mahādevīs. 1. Kumāradevī 2. Dattadevī 3. (a) Dhruvadevī (b) Dhruvasvāminī 4. Anantadevī 5. Candradevī 6. Śrīva(tsa)devī 7. Mitradevī

कुमारदेवी
1. Kumāradevī: (No. 1, L. 29; No. 4, L. 8; No. 10, L. 4; No. 12, L. 18; No. 13, L. 3; No. 21, LL. 5-6; No. 40, L. 4; No. 47, L. 2; No. 53, L. 2; No. 49. L. 2; No. 50, L. 2): She was the wife of Candragupta I and the mother of Samudragupta. Kumāra, the basis of her name has already been explained under Kumāragupta.

दत्तदेवी
2. Dattadevī (No. 4, L. 10; No. 10, L. 5; No. 12, L. 20; No. 13, L. 4; No. 47, L. 3; No. 53, L. 3; No. 49, L. 3; No. 50, L. 3): She is mentioned as the wife of Samudragupta and the mother of Candragupta II. Datta means ‘given’ or protected.^119 We also find ‘Datta’ as the name-ending suffix for male names in literature. 3 (a) Dhruvadevī (No. 53, L. 5; No. 12, L. 21; No. 13, L. 5; No. 49, L. 4; No. 50, L. 4; No. 47, L. 5): She was the mother of Kumāragupta I and the wife of Candragupta II. Literally ‘Dhruva’ means unchangeable or constant. It is also the name of the polar star (personified as son of Uttāna-pāda and grandson of Manu).^120 3 (b). Dhruvasvāminī (No. 42, LL. 3-4): We come to know of Dhruvasvāminī only in No. 42. Lines 1-3 mention her as the wife of Candragupta II and the mother of Govindagupta. As we have noticed Dhruvadevī elsewhere appears as the wife of Candragupta II and mother of Kumāragupta I. It is not much likely that Candragupta II had two queens with almost identical names. As the real name of the two is the same (Dhruva) it would be better to hold that Dhruvasvāminī was another name of Dhruvadevī and Kumāragupta I and Govindagupta were real brothers.

अनन्तदेवी
4. Anantadevī (No. 49, L. 5; No. 50, L. 5; No. 53, L. 6; No. 47, L. 6): She is mentioned as the wife of Kumāragupta I and the mother of Pūrugupta. According to Monier Williams Ananta is the name alike of Viṣṇu, Śeṣa (The Snake-god), Śeṣa's brother Vāsuki; Kṛṣṇa, his brother Baladeva, Śiva and Rudra; and is also included in the list of the Viśve-devas and the Arhats, etc.

चन्द्रदेवी
5. Candradevī^121 (No. 47, L. 7; No. 53, L. 7): The name of the mother of Budhagupta occurring at the beginning of the extant portion of line 7 is not clearly legible; it consists of four letters, the first of which is either ca or va and the second is certainly n with some subscript mark or letter; the third and fourth letters clearly read devyām. It is, therefore, highly probable that her name was Candradevī, known from some seals to have been the name of the queen of Pūrugupta. Hiranand Shastri takes the relevant legend to be ‘Śrīvainyadevyām’^122 but regards the correct reading to be Candra in place of Vainya.^123 No. 47 mentions Candradevī as the name of the mother of Narasiṁhagupta. In No. 53 Candradevī is mentioned as the mother of Budhagupta and wife of Pūrugupta. The name Candradevī is based on the god Candra (Moon).

श्रीवदेवी
6. Śrīva(tsa)devī^124 (No. 49, L. 6; No. 50, L. 6): ‘Śrīva’ is clearly legible but the terminal ‘tsa’ can only faintly be seen. She is mentioned as the wife of Pūrugupta and mother of Narasiṁhagupta. ‘Śrīvatsa’ is the name of Viṣṇu, which literally means ‘beloved or favourite of Śrī’ (Lakṣmī).^125 It is also a symbol or mark of Viṣṇu.^126

मित्रदेवी
7. Mitradevī (No. 49, LL. 7-8; No. 50, L. 7): No. 49 mentions mahādevī Sumatidevī as the wife of Narasiṁhagupta and mother of Kumāragupta III. Fleet read the name as Mahālakṣmīdevī^127 and Hoernle as ‘Śrīmatīdevī’.^128 But in No. 50 the reading is clearly ‘Mitradevī’.^129 Mitra is one of the several names of the Solar deity.

गणपति
1. Gaṇapati (No. 1, L. 13): One of the kings said to have been uprooted by Samudragupta in northern India. The name violates the laws laid down by the Gṛhya-sūtras which prohibit the giving of the names of deities to human-beings directly.^1

2. Gaṇapatināga (No. 1, L. 21): Another king of Āryyāvartta defeated by Samudragupta. The first part is Gaṇapati and the second is ‘nāga’, which signifies that the king belonged to the Nāga dynasty. He probably ruled at Mathurā.^2 Names based on Moon

चन्द्रवर्म्मन्
1. Candravarmman: (No. 1, L. 21): One of the kings of Āryyāvartta defeated by Samudragupta. The first part is Candra and second is ‘Varmma’ which is a form for the original term ‘varman’, a surname generally used for kṣatriyas. He may be identified with the king of that name whose record has been found at Susunia in Bankura district, Bengal.^3

सुरश्मिचन्द्र
2. Suraśmicandra (No. 18, L. 4): He is described as the ruler of the country that lies between the rivers Kālindī and Narmadā, and governing with the qualities of a regent lording, one of the quarters of the world, and enjoying the title of a mahārāja during the reign of Budhagupta. Literally it means ‘a moon possessed of good rays’. Names based on Nāga

नागदत्त
1. Nāgadatta (No. 1, L. 21): One of the kings of Āryyāvartta defeated by Samudragupta. The first part is Nāga which refers most likely to ‘a holy serpent’ and the second is ‘datta’ meaning given. Thus the full name may mean ‘born by the grace of a Nāga’. D.C. Sircar takes the compound as a Caturthī Tatpuruṣa instance meaning ‘dedicated to a Nāga’. However, the compounds are usually taken as Tṛtīyā Tatpuruṣa instances. The names do not indicate towards bali but such names as Gurudatta, Śivadatta and Nāgadatta may exhibit reverence to Guru, Śiva or Nāga by whose worship or blessings the son was born which is attested to by tradition of such names.

नागसेन
2. Nāgasena (No. 1, L. 13, 21): The first part of the name is Nāga and the second is sena. Nāgasena of the L. 13 and L. 21 looks to be the same.^4 According to L. 21 he was one of the kings of Āryyāvartta uprooted by Samudragupta. In L. 13 he is mentioned as having been defeated by Samudragupta by the valour of his arms. He seems to have been an important king.^5 Names based on Śiva

रुद्रदत्त
1. Rudradatta (No. 52, L. 3): He is given the designation of a mahārāja and is mentioned as a pādadāsa (slave of the feet) of Vainyagupta. The first part literally meaning roaring, dreadful or terrible^6 denotes Śiva and the second ‘given’; the full name meaning ‘given by Lord Śiva’.

रुद्रदेव
2. Rudradeva (No. 1, L. 21): He is described as one of the kings of Āryyāvartta defeated by Samudragupta. The first part of the name is Rudra which denotes Lord Śiva and the second is ‘deva’ which means ‘god’. It is another name based on Lord Śiva. Rudradeva has been differently identified by various scholars. Dr. D.C. Sircar has identified him with the Western Satrap Rudrasena II or his son Rudrasena III, while K.P. Jayaswal, K.N. Dikshit and R.N. Dandekar identify him with Vākāṭaka Rudrasena I. U.N. Roy^7 differing with the above scholars proposes his identification with Vākāṭaka Mahārāja Rudrasena II, the son of Pṛthviṣeṇa I.

उग्रसेन
3. Ugrasena (No. 1, L. 20): He is mentioned as a ruler of Pālakka during the reign of Samudragupta. Ugra meaning ‘powerful mighty or terrible’, is another name of Rudra or Śiva.^8 Sena is merely a surname. Or we can give another explanation of the whole as Ugrā senā asya, i.e. ‘having mighty army’. Names based on Sun We find only one such name which is as given below:<BR> --

प्रभाकर
1. Prabhākara (No. 32, L. 8): He is described as a king (bhūmipati) and a destroyer of the enemies of the Gupta dynasty. He was the overlord of Dattabhaṭa. He is not known from any other source. The name of his capital or territory is not mentioned. Probably he was the contemporary local chief of Daśapura and a feudatory ally of the Guptas in their struggle against the Hūṇas.^9 Dattabhaṭa does not include in the inscription the genealogy of his master. It is possible that Prabhākara was a self-made man who did not have a distinguished ancestor worthy of record. He may have been appointed as a ruler of Daśapura by the paramount power, after the extinction of the Varman dynasty.^10 That Prabhākara was not a scion of the Varman dynasty would also appear from his name which, unlike the names of the known members of that dynasty, does not end in Varman.^11 The name violates the laws of Gṛhyasūtras which forbid the direct imposition of the names of deities upon human-beings. Names based on Viṣṇu

अच्युतनन्दिन्
1. Acyutanandin (No. 1, L. 21): He is included in the list of kings of Āryyāvartta forcefully uprooted by Samudragupta. Acyuta is the name of Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa,^12 and Nandin is the name of an attendant of Śiva and also the name of Śiva's bull.^13 So literally the expression would mean ‘one who is a servant of god Visṇu’. Nandin also means gladdening or rejoicing.^14 So it may also mean ‘one who pleases or wins over god Viṣṇu’. Acyutanandin seems to have been a ruler of Ahicchatra (near Bareilly district).^15 The Purāṇas give names ending in ‘Nandin’ in the list of Nāga kings and coins bearing ‘Acyuta’ have been found from Ahicchatra.^16 Therefore, it is possible that Ahicchatra was a seat of government of Acyutanandin.

धन्यविष्णु
2. Dhanyaviṣṇu (No. 18, L. 8): He was the grandson of mahārāja Indraviṣṇu and younger brother of mahārāja Mātṛviṣṇu. We also find his name in line 5 of the Eraṇ Stone Boar Inscription of the time of Toramāṇa (A.D. 500-515).^17 It signifies the tendency of naming persons by using adjectives before the names of deities. Dhanya means ‘bringing or bestowing wealth or the opulent’.^18

हरिविष्णु
3. Hariviṣṇu (No. 18, L. 6): He was the great-grandfather of mahārāja Mātṛviṣṇu. Hari here specifies the Kṛṣṇa apparition of Viṣṇu.^19

इन्द्रविष्णु
4. Indraviṣṇu (No. 18, L. 5): He has been mentioned as a mahārāja, great-grand-father of Mātṛviṣṇu; a brāhmaṇa devoted to studies and celebrating sacrifices and belonging to Maitrāyaṇīya (śākhā). The vedic counterpart is Indrāviṣṇū m. dual.

मतृविष्णु
5. Matṛviṣṇu: (No. 18, L. 7): He was the installer of the stone pillar at Eraṇ, a mahārāja, grandson of mahārāja Indraviṣṇu. We also find his name in the Eraṇ Stone Boar Inscription of the time of Toramāṇa (A.D. 500-515).^20 Mātṛ stands for one of the seven Mātṛkās^21 and may refer to the prevalence of the Mātṛ cult. The name is formed by the similar process of the combination of the names of two deities, Mātṛ and Viṣṇu. Mātṛ if taken as a short form for the Vedic Mātariśvan, together with Viṣṇu would mean Agni and Viṣṇu an interpretation that is relevant to the context.

वरुणविष्णु
6. Varuṇaviṣṇu (No. 18, L. 5): He was the grandfather of mahārāja Mātṛviṣṇu. The name is based on the combination of the names of two deities Varuṇa and Viṣṇu. Varuṇa is the sea-god of the Vedic pantheon.

विष्णुदास
7. Viṣṇudāsa (No. 3, L. 2): Mahārāja Viṣṇudāsa belonged to the Sanakānīka family. Viṣṇu signifies the Lord Viṣṇu and dāsa means ‘a servant’. Thus the whole literally means ‘a servant or devotee of Lord Viṣṇu’. 

विष्णुगोप
8. Viṣṇugopa (No 1, L. 19): A ruler of Kāñcī. According to Diskalkar Viṣṇugopa is undoubtedly identical with an early Pallava king of that name.^22 It can be a synonym of Lord Kṛṣṇa who originally an incarnation of Viṣṇu took his birth as the son of Nanda who was a Gopa. Now we study the names grouping them according to their suffixes. Names ending in ‘datta’

पर्णदत्त
1. Parṇadatta (No. 14, L. 8, L. 9): He is mentioned as a ruler of Surāṣṭra appointed by Skandagupta. He was the father of governor Cakrapālita. Sankalia considers it to be an Iranian name.^23 But it can can very well be an Indian name. Parṇa means a leaf and is as well the name of a tree called Palāśa. We find ‘Parṇadatta’ to be the name of a man in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā.^24 It signifies ‘a person born as a result of the worship of the Parṇa (Palāśa) tree’.

स्वामिदत्त
2. Svāmidatta^25 (No. 1, L. 19): He is mentioned as one of the Dakṣiṇāpatha kings. He was a ruler of Koṭṭūra and was defeated by Samudragupta. Literally the name means ‘given by God’, the first part being Svāmin and the second datta'. Names ending in ‘Giri’

महेन्द्रगिरि
1. Mahendragiri^26 (No. 1, L. 19): The first part is Mahendra, i.e., the great Indra and the second is ‘giri’, which means a mountain. It is also an honorific name later on given to one of the ten orders of the Das-nami Gosains (founded by ten pupils of Śaṅkarācārya; the word giri is added to the name of each member).^27 We also find it used with the names of ascetics. He was one of the Dakṣiṇāptha kings defeated by Samudragupta. Names ending in Mitra

पुष्यमित्र
Puṣyamitra (No. 13, L. 11,): The name is mentioned in plural.^28 It is said that Puṣyamitras who had developed great power and wealth were defeated by king Skandagupta. The other readings suggested by scholars are Puṣpamitra and Yudhyamitra. But a careful scrutiny will support the reading Puṣyamitra as more likely. In the passages quoted by Bühler from the Prakrit Gāthās, ascribed to Merutuṅga, Dharmasāgara and Jayavijayāgni^29, the name of the early king Puṣyamitra, the contemporary of Patañjali appears as Pusamitta and thus supports the reading Puṣyamitra. Puṣyamitra in plural may denote the followers of king Puṣyamitra. Puṣyamitra, the name of a tribe in Central India, is also mentioned in the Purāṇas. Names ending in Rājan(Rāja)

देवराज
1. Devarāja (No. 5, L. 7): Fleet fills up the lacuna^30 and takes Devarāja to be the name of an officer of Candragupta II.^31 But D.C. Sircar takes it as another name of Candragupta II.^32 The view of Sircar is more plausible and has been generally accepted by scholars.^33 It may, however, be noted that in Vākāṭaka grants Devagupta is mentioned as another name of a Candragupta II.^34 Literally the name means ‘a king of gods’ which is also another name of Indra.

गोपराज
2. Goparāja (No. 19, LL. 3, 5): A feudatory cheif who is said to have accompanied the mighty king glorious Bhānugupta and fought a famous battle. Goparāja died in the battle and his wife burnt herself on the funeral pyre along with him. The inscription informs us that he was the son of a king named Mādhava, and was the daughter's son of the Śarabha king, belonging to the lineage of Lakṣa of which he is described as an ornament. Literally the name means ‘a king of the Gopas’, i.e., milkmen or Ahīras. Rāja is a surname signifying ‘the king’.

मण्टराज
3. Maṇṭarāja (No. 1, L. 19): King of Kurūḷa, one of the rulers of Dakṣṇāpatha defeated by Samudragupta. In this name the first part is Maṇṭa and the second is Rāja. The meaning of the first part is not clear. It is clearly not a Sanskrit word. As Woolner has pointed out words with cerebrals are often non-Āryan or influenced by non-Āryan elements.^35 Another possibility is that these names show dialectal elements. Even now-a-days we give names like Maṇṭu, Baṇṭu, etc., to little children. There is also a possibility that the Sanskrit word ‘mantra’ meaning ‘a hymn or magical formula’ got changed to ‘maṇṭa’ through a process of Prakritization, or we may derive it from an artificial root ‘maṇṭ’ to act as intermediator.^36

नीलराज
4. Nīlarāja (No. 1, LL. 19-20): A king of Avamukta, one of the Dakṣiṇāpatha kings defeated by Samudragupta. The first part of the name is Nīla and the second is rāja. Nīla means ‘of dark colour’ especially blue or green or black^37 and is also the name of a Nāga and rāja is the surname added to it.

शर्भराज
5. Śarbharāja (No. 19, L. 4): He was the maternal grandfather of Goparāja, the feudatory chief of king Bhānugupta. Śarabha is the name of a people and also refers to a fabulous animal supposed to have eight legs and to inhabit the snowy mountains; it is represented as stronger than the lion and the elephant.^38 The name may literally mean ‘a king of the Śarabha people’. It may also be treated as a name based on an animal.

व्याघ्रराज
6. Vyāghrarāja (No. 1, L. 19): He was the ruler of Mahākāntāra and was one of the kings of Dakṣiṇāpatha defeated by Samudragupta. He has been identified with the Vākāṭaka feudatory prince Vyāghra whose inscriptions have been found at Nach-ne-ki-talai and Ganj in Central India, who is also said to have been the ruler of the Ucchakalpa dynasty in Bundelkhand.^39 But an objection to this view is that he must be a ruler in Dakṣiṇāpatha as mentioned in our inscription and has accordingly been identified with the ruler of Mahā-vana, a synonym of Mahā-kāntāra, also called Jeypore forest in Orissa.^40 The name is based on the animal Vyāghra, or tiger implying that in Mahākāntāra his subordinate chiefs were like tigers and he was their ruler. The name is a good selection in the context of the fact that the region of Mahākāntāra is known to have been infested with tigers.

राज
7...rāja (No. 19, L. 3): The first part of the name has been damaged. He was a king and was the grandfather of Goparāja, the feudatory chief of king Bhānugupta. He was the founder of the Lakṣa lineage. Names ending in Varman

बलवर्म्मन्
1. Balavarmman (No. 1, L. 21): One of the kings of Āryyāvartta said to have been forcefully uprotted by Samudragupta. The first part of the name is Bala which means strength or power and the second part Varmman is a surname used for kṣatriyas. The name may literally mean ‘one who protects with his power’. It is a name based on quality.

बन्धुवर्म्मन्
2. Bandhuvarmman (No. 17, L. 15, L. 16): Bandhuvarmman was the son of Viśvavarman. He was probably a feudatory chief, ruling at Dasapura, Mandasor in Western Malwa,^41 in the time of Kumāragupta I. He has been mentioned as a king (nṛpa) governing the city of Daśapura and it was under his rulership that the Sun-temple was caused to be built by the guild of silk-cloth weavers at Mandasor (Daśapura). The relevant lines in the inscription lay a stress on his name Bandhu. He is described as possessed of firmness and statesmanship; beloved of (his) kinsmen; the relative, as it were, of (his) subjects; the remover of the afflictions of (his) connections; pre-eminently skilful in destroying the ranks of (his) proud enemies.^42 Varman is a kṣatriya surname meaning ‘the protector’, the entire expression may literally be translated as ‘the protector of his relatives’.

भीमवर्मन्
3. Bhīmavarman (No. 26, L. 1): He is mentioned as a mahārāja and seems to have been a feudatory king of Skandagupta. Bhīma was the name of one of the five Pāṇḍavas (the second son of Pāṇḍu) mentioned in the Mahābhārata. Literally the name may mean ‘one who protects by awfulness’. Bhīma is also the name of Rudra-Śiva, one of the eight forms of Śiva.^43 Thus it may be a name based on god Śiva.

हस्तिवर्म्मन्
4. Hastivarmman (No. 1, L. 2): A king of Veṅgī in the time of Samudragupta and included in the list of the Dakṣiṇāpatha kings defeated by the latter. He is identical with the king of the Sālaṅkāyana dynasty whose record has been found at Peddavegi.^44 It is a name based on animal. The name Hastin (elephant) denotes fatness and valour.

विश्ववर्म्मन्
5. Viśvavarmman (No. 17, L. 14): A ruler (Goptṛ) in the time of Kumāragupta I. Literally the name may mean ‘a protector of the world’. There is a second possibility that it is a name based on the deity Viṣṇu, because Viśva meaning all-pervading or all-containing, omnipresent,^45 is also the name of Viṣṇu-kṛṣṇa. One-word names

अच्युत
1. Acyuta (No. 1, L. 13): It is the same as Acyutanandin mentioned in line 21.^46 It is the abbreviated form of the full name Acyutanandin where the latter part is dropped. The abridged form ‘Acyuta’ leads to the violation of the injunctions of the Dharma-sūtras which forbid giving direct names of gods to human-beings. Acyuta is the name of god Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa.^47

छगलग
2. Chagalaga (No. 3, L. 2): A mahārāja, grandfather of a mahārāja whose name in line 2 is illegible and who belonged to the Sanakānīka tribe or family, who was a feudatory of Candragupta II. We find the word Chagala literally meaning ‘a hegoat’^48 in the Uṇādi-sūtras of Pāṇini where it is the name of a Ṛṣi.^49 It seems to be a nonĀryan word. The words Chagala, Chagalaka or Chagalaga mean the same.^50

दमन
3. Damana (No. 1, L. 19): A ruler of Eraṇḍapalla who was one of the Dakṣiṇāpatha kings conquered by Samudragupta. We get this name in the Mahābhārata and the Purāṇas. Literally the word daman means ‘taming, subduing, overpowering’;^51 hence the name may mean ‘one who subdues or overpowers others’.

धनञ्जय
4. Dhanañjaya (No. 1, L. 20): A ruler of Kusthalapura and one of the Dakṣiṇāpatha kings defeated by Samudragupta. The name has some connection with the Epic. In the Mahābhārata Dhanañjaya is one of the epithets of Arjuna Literally it would mean, ‘one who wins a prize or booty or acquires wealth’.

कुबेर
5. Kubera (No. 1, L. 20): Ruler of Devarāṣṭra mentioned in the list of the kings of Dakṣiṇāpatha who were defeated by Samudragupta. According to Bhandarkar Kubera was perhaps the father of Kubera-nāgā of the Nāga family, who was a queen of Candragupta II.^52 In this case the name of Kubera, the god of wealth, has been given directly which is against the rules prescribed by the Gṛhya-sūtras.^53

माधव
6. Mādhava (No. 19, L. 3): Father of Goparāja, the feudatory of Bhānugupta; born of Lakṣa lineage. It is the name of Lord Kṛṣṇa given to this king which violates the rules of Dharmasūtras.

मतिल
7. Matila (No. 1, L. 21): One of the kings of Āryyāvartta defeated by Samudragupta. According to Pāṇini,^54 a polysyllabic name was sometime shortened in order to express affection. Thus in the case of names ending in ‘ila’ we find Devila being derived from Devadatta; Yajñila and Yajñadatta; Makhila from Makhadeva; Agila from Agnidatta; Satila from Svātidatta; Nāgila from Nāgadatta, and Yasila, Yakhila from Yakṣadatta.^55 Similarly Matila can be formed from Matideva or Matidatta. NAMES OF MINISTERS

आम्रकार्द्दव
1. Āmrakārddava (No. 5, L. 5): Hailing from Sukuli-deśa who loyally served Candragupta II by fighting and winning many battles for him. The first part of the name is based on the mango tree. The second part is kārddava.^56 It is the name of some Nāgas or serpent-demons thought to be inhabitants of the lower regions.^57 Kadru is the name of the mother of serpents. Kādrava by metathesis becomes Kārddava which literally means ‘born of Kadru’. In south, among aboriginal people and lower castes, the practice of matriarchal names is well known. The whole term ‘Āmrakārddava’ is inexplicable as one word. Āmra seems to be his personal name and Kārddava his family title. 

हरिषेण
2. Hariṣeṇa (No. 1, L. 32): He is given several titles indicating offices held of a Khādyaṭapākika,^58 a Sāndhivigrahika, a Kumārāmātya and a Mahādaṇḍanāyaka of Samudragupta. He is also the composer of this inscription which has been termed as a kāvya.^59 Hari is Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa and sena is to be obtained from Sanskrit senā. The name can be explained in two ways. That Hari is his personal name and ṣeṇa or sena his surname. We may also explain it is, ‘one with Hari as his army’. The Mahābhārata informs us that there was only big army on the side of the Kauarvas and there was only Hari, i.e., Lord Kṛṣṇa on the side of the Pāṇḍavas. The Pāṇḍavas could get Hari on their side by foregoing the Yādava army to the Kauravas.

वीरसेन
3. Vīrasena (No. 6, L. 4): Hailing from Pāṭaliputra he was Candragupta II's minister for peace and war by hereditary right^60 and accompanied the king on his far-reaching military expeditions. The first part is Vīra which means ‘brave’ and the second is ‘sena’, the whole literally meaning ‘one with a brave army’. Pāṇini refers to Senānta names in his Aṣṭādhyāyī.^61 We find many such names as Vārisena, Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa, Bhīmasena and Ugrasena.^62 U.N. Roy conjectures the possibility of the composition of the ‘Praśasti’ inscribed on the Meharauli Iron Pillar Inscription by Śāba alias Vīrasena who was an accomplished poet and a favourite minister of Candragupta II, Vikramāditya.^63 It is possible that he outlived his patron and when during a Dharmayātrā he revisited the spot where the lofty banner had been raised as a mark of homage to Lord Viṣṇu after the victory over the Vāhlikas, was moved to compose and inscribe this Praśasti on the Meharauli Pillar.^64 Names of Commanders

दत्तभट
1. Dattabhaṭa (No. 32, L. 7): A son of Vāyurakṣita, himself also a general of the armies of king Prabhākara (appointed by him). We find here the word ‘datta’ used as the first part of the name. The second part is ‘bhaṭa’ which means a ‘warrior’.

ध्रुवभूति
2. Dhruvabhūti (No. 1, L. 32): He was a mahādaṇḍanāyaka and is mentioned in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta. The first part is dhruva which means ‘firm’ or definite and the second part is bhūti which means ‘wealth or prosperity’, a surname generally used for Vaiśyas. Literally it would mean ‘whose prosperity is enduring’.

गोपस्वामिन्
3. Gopasvāmin (No. 40, L. 11; No. 21, L. 15): In No. 40, he has been mentioned as akṣapāṭalādhikṛta, mahāpīlupati and mahābalādhikṛta. The Gayā spurious copper plate inscription of Samudragupta (No. 21) was written by the order of Dyūta-gopasvāmin, akṣapaṭalādhikṛta of another village. Literally-Gopasvāmin means ‘Lord of herdsmen’ which is a popular expression for Lord Kṛṣṇa.

हरिषेण
4. Hariṣeṇa (No. 1, L. 32): He has been mentioned as a mahādaṇḍanāyaka in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta. His name has already been explained among the names of ministers.

तिलभट्टक
5. Tilabhaṭṭaka^65 (No. 1, L. 33): He was a mahādaṇḍanāyaka and is mentioned in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta. We find personal names with their first part as ‘Tilaka’ but never as ‘Tila’.^66 In the present case also the first part of the name was probably ‘Tilaka’ and the second was bhaṭṭa. Later on by the process of metathesis the name may have become ‘Tilabhaṭṭaka’. Tilaka is a mark on the forehead (made with coloured earths, sandal-wood, or unguents, either as an ornament of a sectarial distinction),^67 the second part ‘bhaṭṭa’ is a surname.

वायुरक्षित
6. Vāyurakṣita^68 (No. 32, L. 5): He was a commander of the army (senāpati). The first part of the name is Vāyu standing for ‘the god of the wind’,^69 and the second part is ‘rakṣita’ which means ‘protected’. The full name literally means ‘protected by the god of the wind’. Names of Governors

ब्रह्मदत्त
1. Brahmadatta (No. 33, L. 2): An Uparika-mahārāja ruling over the Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti in the reign of Budhagupta. The name would literally mean, ‘given by (the grace of) God’.

चक्रपालित
2. Cakrapālita (No. 14, L. 11, L. 27): Governor of Surāṣṭra in the reign of Skandagupta who restored the break in the Sudarśana lake and renewed the embankment. It has been shown by Charpentier that he was an Iranian.^70 We find many Iranians adopting names after Hindu gods.^71 Cakrapālita means ‘one protected by the disc (bearer)’, i.e., a devotee of Viṣṇu, a name adopted after this person became a Vaiṣṇava (Hindu).^72

चिरातदत्त
3. Cirātadatta (No. 34, L. 2, L. 3): The first part Cirāta can be a Prakritization of the word Kirāta which is the name of Śiva (the god Śiva in the form of a wild mountaineer or Kirāta as opposed to Arjuna).^73 Hence the complete expression would literally mean ‘begotton by the grace of Kirāta’.

जयदत्त
4. Jayadatta (No. 33, L. 3): It is the name of an Uparika-mahārāja in the reign of Budhagupta. Jaya is the name of Arjuna (son of Pāṇḍu).^74 The second part ‘datta’ is a surname. It may thus be a name based on the Epic. It may also be noted that Jayadatta was the name of a Bodhisattva.^75

विजयसेन
5. Vijayasena (No. 52, L. 16): He was a dūtaka, mahāpratihāra, a mahāpīlupati, an uparika of five adhikaraṇas, an uparīka over a patī, an uparika over a purapāla, a mahārāja and Śrī mahāsāmanta during the reign of Vainyagupta. The name can literally mean ‘one whose army always wins’. Names of Kumārāmātyas^76

कुलवृद्धि
1. Kulavṛddhi (No. 44, L. 1): One of the Kumārāmātyas in the time of Kumāragupta I. This is a very good name which literally means ‘one who increases the family’. A son is always considered to continue the genealogical sequence and hence to increase the family.

पृथिवीषेण
2. Pṛthivīṣeṇa^77 (No. 39, L. 7): The son of Śikharasvāmin, the minister, and the kumārāmātya mahābalādhikṛta of Candragupta II. He himself was the minister, the kumārāmātya and mahābalādhikṛta of Kumāragupta I. His grandfather was Viṣṇupālitabhaṭṭa,^78 the son of Kuramāravyabhaṭṭa^79 of the gotras Aśva and Vājin and who was a teacher of Chandoga (Veda). 

रेवज्जस्वामिन्
3. Revajjasvāmin (No. 52, L. 17): A kumārāmātya in the time of Vainyagupta. The first part is Revajja and the second svāmin. Revajja can be derived from revat which means rich or prosperous.^80 Thus the name would literally mean ‘master of the rich’.

शिखरस्वामिन्
4. Śikharasvāmin (No. 39, L. 6): He was the minister and the kumārāmātya of mahārājādhirāja, illustrious Candragupta II and was the son of Viṣṇupālitabhaṭṭa, the son of Kuramāravyabhaṭṭa, a teacher of the Chandoga (Veda). Śikhara means a peak or summit of a mountain, hence the whole may literally mean ‘one who is a master of śikhara’. The name seems to represent Lord Śiva due to Śiva's connection with the Himalayas.

वेत्रवर्मन्
5. Vetravarman (No. 34, L. 4; No. 35, LL. 3-4): A kumārāmātya in the time of Kumāragupta I. Vetra means the rod or mace of an officer, or staff of a door-keeper.^81 So the whole will literally mean ‘one who protects by means of a vetra’. Names of Āyuktakas (Commissioners or District collectors)

अच्युतदास
1. Acyutadāsa (No. 43. L. 1): Acyuta is the name of Lord Viṣṇu. So the present name would literally mean ‘a dāsa or servant of Viṣṇu’. According to the smṛtis the surname dāsa should be used for śūdras.^82

भामह
2. Bhāmaha (No. 52, L. 17): He has been mentioned as a bhogika in this inscription. It was also the name of the author of the Alaṁkāra-śāstra and of the Prākrita-manoramā (commentary on the Prākrita-prakāśa)^83 Literally the name may mean ‘one possessing great light, splendour or brightness’.

देवभट्टारक
4. Devabhaṭṭāraka (No. 37, L. 3): He is mentioned to have ruled over the viṣaya of Koṭivarṣa. The name is based on the name of Lord Sun. Devabhaṭṭāraka seems to be a metathesis of Bhaṭṭārakadeva which means ‘The god Bhaṭṭāraka’. 

शण्डक
5. Śa (ga) ṇḍaka (No. 36, L. 3): D.C. Sircar takes the reading to be Gaṇḍaka which seems to be correct.^85 One scholar^86 equates Śaṇḍaka with Saṇḍaka which means a ‘bull’ and says that the word Gaṇḍaka yields no sensible meaning. But Gaṇḍaka has been accepted as the most probable reading by scholars.^87 Gaṇḍaka is the name of a river in the northern part of India.^88 So the name Gaṇḍaka based on the river Gaṇḍakī can be given to a person just as the name Gaṅgā based on the river Ganges is given to a person. Gaṇḍaka is also the name of the Videhas living on the river Gaṇḍakī^89 and also refers to a rhinoceros.^90 It is possible that the present name, like Vyāghra discussed elsewhere is based on the name of an animal.

शर्व्वनाग
6. Śarvvanāga (No. 16, LL. 4-5): He was a viṣayapati in the reign of Skaṇdagupta. Śarvva is the name of Lord Śiva^91 and nāga may be a surname indicating that the person belonged to the Nāga tribe.

स्वयम्भुदेव
7. Svayambhu (ū) deva (No. 37, L. 4): He has been mentioned as a Viṣayapati in the Damodarpur copper plate inscription of Bhānugupta. Literally the name would mean ‘self-existent god’, i.e., Brahmā. As meantioned earlier the practice of giving names of gods to human-beings directly is against the tradition of the Dharmasūtras.

च्छन्दक
1. Ccha(cha)ndaka (No. 46, L. 12): He is mentioned as the youngest son of a certain Hari-śreṣṭhin. Chandaka means ‘charming’. It was the name of Gautama Buddha's charioteer.^1

हरिश्रेष्ठिन्
3. Hari-śreṣṭhin (No. 46, L. 11): He was the son of Kaivarttiśreṣṭhin. While he and his father are called śreṣṭhins, none of his sons is called śreṣṭhin or banker by profession. Hari is the name of god Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa:

कैवर्त्तिश्रेष्ठिन्
4. Kaivartti-śreṣṭhin (No. 46, L. 11): Kaivarta is a fisherman (born of prostitute by kṣatriya or of an Ayogava female by a Niṣāda father).^4 We may infer that his mother was from the family of a fisherman and father belonged to a Śreṣṭhin class.

रिभुपाल
5. Ribhupāla (No. 36, LL. 3-4; L. 5, L. 14; No. 37, L. 4): The orthographic change in the first letter is to be noted.^5 Ribhu here may mean property or wealth.^6 The whole may thus mean, ‘a protector of property or wealth’. In No. 36 Ribhupāla has been mentioned as nagara-śreṣṭhin. In No. 37 he is also described as Āryya.

श्रीदत्त
6. Śrīdatta (No. 46, LL. 11-22): He was the eldest son of Hari-śreṣṭhin and the grandson of Kaivartti-śreṣṭhin. Śrī is the goddess of wealth and datta means given. The whole expression will mean, ‘born by the grace of the goddess of wealth’.

वर्ग्ग
7. Vargga, Vargga-grāmika (No. 46, L. 12, L. 15): He was the middle son of Hari-śreṣṭhin. In L. 12 he is mentioned only as Vargga and in L. 15 as Vargga-grāmika. While his father is called a śreṣṭhin he was not śreṣṭhin or banker by profession. The word grāmika affixed to Vargga's name suggests that he was the headman of a village which seems to be no other than Avaḍāra. Vargga literally means one who excludes or removes or averts’.^7 NAMES OF PRATHAMA KULIKAS (Chief Artisans)

धृतिमित्र
1. Dhṛtimitra (No. 34, L. 5; No. 35, L. 5): It is a name based on virtue, the first part being Dhṛti ‘perseverance’ and the second'part ‘mitra’ friend, the whole meaning ‘one who is friendly to perseverance’, i.e., a man full of perseverance. Names ending in mitra^8 are very few in the Vedic literature but seem to have been very popular in the post-Pāṇinian period. Coins^9 as well as the epigraphic records show an abundant use of mitra- ending names.^10

मतिदत्त
2. Matidatta (No. 37, L. 5): It is also a name based on virtue, the first part being ‘mati’ intellect and the second ‘datta’, the whole meaning, ‘begotton by virtue of intellect’.

भीम
Bhīma (No. 43, LL. 3; 17, 19, 25): It is a name based on the Epic tradition. Bhīma was the name of one of the five Pāṇḍavas in the Mahābhārata and literally means ‘dreadful’. NAMES OF PRATHAMA KĀYASTHAS (Chief Scribes)

शाम्बपाल
1. Śāmbapāla (No. 34, LL. 5-6; No. 35, L. 5): The first part of the name Śāmba is to be derived from Sāmba which literally means accompanied by Ambā (Durgā) and is the name of Lord Śiva.^12 It has been the name of a son of Kṛṣṇa and Jāmbavatī as well as of several authors and teachers.^13 Pāla is a name-ending suffix having the least significance in the present case. Perhaps it has been added only to honour the Gṛhyasūtra injunction of not giving names of deities directly to human-beings.^14

स्कन्दपाल
2. Skandapāla (No. 37, L. 5): Skanda is the name of Kārttikeya. Pāla here is a mere nameending suffix which has the same significance as in the case of Śāmbapāta discussed above.

विप्रपाल
3. Viprapāla (No. 36, L. 4): The first part is vipra which means a brāhmaṇa and the second part is ‘pāla’ which means ‘protector’. the whole thus meaning ‘one who protects the brāhmaṇas’. We do not get pāla nameending in the Pāṇinian period. It is a kṣatriya name-ending. NAMES OF KĀYASTHAS (Scribes)

देवदत्त
1. Devadatta (No. 43, L. 3): The first part of the name is deva and the second is datta, the whole meaning ‘given by the gods’. This name was very popular in the time of Patañjali.^15

नरदत्त
4. Naradatta (No. 52, L. 18): The first part is Nara which here means the primeval man or eternal spirit pervading the universe, i.e., Puruṣa (always associated with Nārāyaṇa ‘son of the primeval man’). Both Nara and Nārāyaṇa are considered as gods or sages and accordingly called devau, ṛṣī, tapasau.^17 The second part is datta, the whole meaning ‘given by the eternal spirit pervading the universe’. He seems to have been a scribe belonging to the office of the minister for peace and war.^18

प्रभुचन्द्र
5. Prabhucandra (No. 43, L. 3, L. 25): The first part is Prabhu which is one of the names of Lord Śiva in the Mahābhārata.^19 The second is candra, the whole meaning ‘a moon, (on the forehead) of Śiva.^20

1. Bhaṭanandin (No. 37, L. 11): The first part is Bhaṭa and the second is nandin. Bhaṭa here is the name of a serpent-demon.^21 The whole means ‘one who is an attendant of Bhaṭa’. The other meaning of Bhaṭa is scholar which is not applicable here.

दिवाकरनन्दिन्
2. Divākaranandin (No. 28, L, 10): The first part is ‘Divākara’ (day-maker), which is another name of god Sun.^22 Nandin here is a name-ending suffix literally meaning ‘the happy one’ and is the name of Viṣṇu, Śiva and an attendant of Śiva. This name-ending was not known in the time of Pāṇini. According to Sankalia names directly after deities were probably after the family-god,^23 which in the present case seems to have been Śiva. It is possible that the first part of the name was connected with same deity and than the name of the family-deity was added as the name-ending surname. The word nandin is generally used to refer to ‘an attendant of Śiva’ or the vāhana ‘nandīn’ bull of Śiva. So the name Divākarnandin may literally mean ‘an attendant of god Sun’. The word Nandin also means ‘gladdening’.^24 So another interpretation can be ‘one who pleases or wins over Lord Sun’.

गोपदत्त
3. Gopadatta (No. 37, L. 11): The first part is Gopa and the second is datta. Gopa literally meaning cowherd is a synonym for Lord Kṛṣṇa.^25 So it would mean ‘born by the grace of Lord Kṛṣṇa’. Names ending in datta are common in Buddhist literature.^26

4. Nara (na) ndin (No. 37, L. 10): The first part Nara here means the primeval or eternal spirit pervading the universe,^27 the second part is nandin; the whole meaning ‘one who is an attendant of Nara’.

रिशिदत्त
2. Riśidatta^30 (No. 34, L. 10): Risidatta^31 (No. 35, L. 7): We get this word in above two forms but the first form is more accurate though not fully correct due to orthographic differences. The correct form should be ‘Ṛṣidatta’. The first part ‘Ṛṣi’ means ‘a sage’ and ‘datta’ means given, the whole meaning ‘given by (the grace of) a sage’.

विभुदत्त
3. Vibhudatta (No. 34, L. 10; No. 35, L. 7): ‘Vibhu’ means all-pervading, and is applied to the names of several important gods, Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva, the Sun, Kubera and Indra^32 and ‘datta’ means ‘given’. The whole thus literally means ‘given by the all-pervading, i.e. God’.

It is the name of Lord Śiva (who is supposed to remain as motionless as the trunk of a tree during his austerities).^35 Nandin means ‘an attendant’. The whole thus literally means ‘one who is an attendant of Lord Śiva^36 or the one who pleases or wins over Lord Śiva.

विजयनन्दिन्
5. Vijayanandin (No. 36, L. 9): Vijaya is the name of god yama,^37 according to the lexicographical works, of a son of Jayanta (son of Indra), of a son of vasu-deva; of a son of Kṛṣṇa and of an attendant of Viṣṇu, and nandin means ‘an attendant’, or the one who pleases or wins over lord Yama.

धृतिविष्णु
1. Dhṛtiviṣṇu (No. 28, L. 10): The first part is Dhṛtī which means resolution or satisfaction. It is a name based on virtue. The second part Viṣṇu gives no meaning to the first part; it has only been added probably as the family deity.^39

1. Gaṇḍa (No. 43, L. 4): According to lexicographers Gaṇḍa means ‘the chief; best, excellent’^43 and thus can signify a hero. The term is also used for the animal rhinoceros, so it can also be a case of a name based on the name of an animal. The custom of deriving names from animals was unknown in the Vedic pericd.^44 But in Pāṇini we find such references.^45

हरिसिंह
2. Harisiṁha (No. 43, L. 5): The first part is Hari which is the name alike of Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa, Moon, Vāyu (the god of the Wind) and according to lexicographers of Śiva.^46 The Second part ‘siṁha’ has the purpose only of a surname and does not give any sensible meaning to the first part. In modern practice the word ‘siṁha’ is used as a surname of kṣatriya, ṭhākur and rajput castes.

ज्येष्ठदाम
3. Jyeṣṭhadāma (No. 43, LL. 4-5): The first part of the word is Jyeṣṭha literally meaning elder. Here it may stand for Jyeṣṭha Liṅga described in the Liṅga Purāṇa.^47 The second part dāma means ‘a garland’.^48 The whole thus literally means, ‘a garland of Jyeṣṭha Liṅga’ and testifies to the popularity of the Jyeṣṭha Liṅga as an object of religious reverence.

खासक
6. Khāsaka (No. 29, L. 5): It is an abbreviated name with the addition of suffix ‘ka’ which according to Pāṇini is used to denote:<BR> -(i) Depreciation.^54 (ii) Endearment.^55 It is a non-Sanskritic word most probably a local or dialectal feature. Here ‘ka’ suffix may have been used in the sense of endearment meaning a “poor khasa”: Khasa is the name of a people and of their country (in the north of India).^56 Khāsaka can be native of that country or a man belonging to that race (considered as a degraded kṣatriya).^57

राम
9. Rāma (No. 29, L. 6): It is another one-word name. Here the name of Lord Rāma, the Epic hero, has been given directly to a person against the rules of the Smṛtis. We may suggest that in such cases either the second part is dropped or is not given at all by the parents.

रामक
10. Rāmaka (No. 29, L. 5): It is also an abbreviated name possibly from Rāma-datta (Cf. Pāṇini V. 3. 82) with the addition of the suffix ‘ka’. In the Agni Purāṇa it is the name of Rāma Rāghava.^61 It is formed from § ram and means delighting, gratifying.^62 According to lexicographers a Rāmaka is a Māgadha who lives as a messenger.^63 But here it is a personal name based on the Epic hero Lord Rāma.

14. Śuṅkaka (No. 29, L. 4): It is also an abbreviated name with the addition of suffix ‘ka’. The word should have been Śaṅkuka instead of Śuṅkaka. The present form may be due to the mistake of the engraver. The word Śuṅkaka is meaningless. Śaṅku is the name of Lord Śiva. We have many names based on the word Śaṅku in literature. Śaṅkuka was the name of a poet (author of the Bhuvanābhyudaya and son of Mayūra),^66 and also of a writer on rhetoric.^67

वर्ग्गपाल
15. Varggapāla (No. 29, L. 4): The first part is Vargga which means ‘a separate division, group, company, family, party’, literally meaning ‘one who excludes or removes or averts’.^68 The second part is pāla meaning protector, thus the whole means ‘protector of the division, group or party’.

श्रीभद्र
5. Śrībhadra (No. 29, L. 17): He engraved the Dhanaidaha Copper Plate Inscription of Kumāragupta 1. Śrībhadra is the name of a serpent-demon in the Buddhist literature.

तिलभट्टक
7. Tilabhaṭṭaka (No. 1, L. 33): The Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta was inscribed by Mahādaṇḍanāyaka Tilabhaṭṭaka, who is described as meditating on the feet of the Paramabhaṭṭāraka.^77 The name has already been discussed among the names of Commanders.

Vatsabhaṭṭi (No. 17, L. 23): The Mandasor Stone Inscription of Kumāragupta and Bandhuvarman (the Mālava years 493 and 529) was composed by Vatsabhaṭṭi.^78 Vatsa is often used as a term of endearment (= my dear child).^79 Originally it was used for a calf, then for the young of any animal and finally for any offspring or child.

3. Bhṛ (bhru) kuṇṭhasiṁha (No. 16, L. 6): The first part of the name means “one with contracted brows (out of anger)”. The second part is siṁha or lion which is often the surname of kṣatriyas.

कपिल
4. Kapila (No. 33, L. 8): He is described as a merchant but he also acted as a scribe. The name is based on colour and is probably to be connected with kapi ‘monkey-coloured’ brown, tawny, reddish.^97

श्रीभद्र
5. Śrībhadra (No. 33, L. 8): It is the name of a merchant who also acts as a scribe. It is a name based on Śrī ‘the goddess of wealth’, the whole meaning ‘auspicious for wealth’.

स्थाणुदत्त
6. Sthāṇudatta (No. 37. L. 5): The name is based on the name of Lord Śiva who is also called, ‘Sthāṇu’ meaning firm or immovable.^98 ‘Datta’ is a surname which means ‘given’. The whole expression means begotten on by the grace of Lord ‘Śiva’.

स्थायपाल
7. Sthāya (na) pāla (No. 33, L. 8): A merchant who also acts as a scribe. D.C. Sircar takes the reading ‘Sthāyapāla’.^99 He also suggests the possibility of a second reading ‘sthānapāla’ which means ‘watchman or policeman’.^100 This reading seems to be correct; Sthāyapāla yields no sensible meaning.

वसुमित्र
8. Vasumitra (No. 36, L. 4): The first part of the name is vasu (wealth) and the second is mitra the whole literally meaning ‘a friend of wealth’. Another possibility is that the name vasu stands for a group of deities and mitra means the sun and vasumitra thereby yielding the sense “a sun among deities”

देवभट्ट
1. Devabhaṭṭa (No. 43, LL. 14-15; L. 26): Deva, the first part of the name, means ‘god, heavenly or divine’. The second part is a name-ending suffix used for learned brāhmaṇas. The ending Bhaṭṭa denoting a scholar later became a surname just as the English word ‘Master’ is undergoing a change in usage with the Gujarati-speaking people and the word ‘professor’ may soon have with the Marāṭhī-speaking people.^1 Devabhaṭṭa was a brāhmaṇa. He was an inhabitant of Puṇḍravardhana. He belonged to Vājasaneyacaraṇa, and was versed in the four Vedas.

कुरमरव्यभट्ट
2. Kurama(ā)ravyabhaṭṭa (No. 39, L. 5): He is mentioned as a teacher of Chandoga (Veda), with the gotras Aśva and Vājin. Kuramā means bad (or misused) wealth and ‘ravya’ means ‘famous’; bhaṭṭa is a surname added to the names of scholarly brāhmaṇas. So the whole expression may mean ‘a teacher who is known for the ill use of his wealth’. Though such queer names are actually in practice it is not unlikely that in the present case it is the nick-name which has been mentioned.

विष्णुपालितभट्ट
3. Viṣṇupālitabhaṭṭa (No. 39, L. 5): He was the son of Kuramāravyabhaṭṭa, a teacher of the Chandoga (Veda), with the gotras Aśva and Vājin. The first part of his name ‘Viṣṇupālita’ literally means ‘protected by god Viṣṇu’; the second part ‘bhaṭṭa’ signifies a learned brāhmaṇa. Names ending in Datta

अमरदत्त
1. Amaradatta (No. 43, L. 15; L. 26): The first part ‘Amara’ means ‘a god’ and the second part ‘datta’ means ‘given’. Thus the whole will mean ‘Given by gods’. He was an inhabitant of Puṇḍravardhana, and is described as belonging to Vājasaneyacaraṇa and as versed in the four Vedas. Amaradatta was also the name of a lexicographer and also of a prince in the Kathāsaritsāgara.^2

महासेनदत्त
2. Mahāsenadatta (No. 43, L. 15; L. 26): The first part is ‘Mahāsena’ which is the name of Kārttikeya or Skanda.^3 The second part is ‘datta’ which means ‘given’.

2. Nāthaśarmman (No. 28, LL. 3-4; L. 12; L. 17): In lines 3-4 and 12 we get the second part as śarmman but in L. 17 we find it as śarmma. The first part is Nātha meaning ‘protector, patron, possessor, owner, lord’^4 The second part is a brāhmaṇa surname. Nātha is the name of several authors.^5

शिवशर्म्मन्
3. Śivaśarmman (No. 29, L. 3): The first part is the name of god Siva and the second is śarmman. Names ending in Svāmin

गोपदेवस्वामिन्
1. Gopadevasvāmin (No. 21, L. 10): The name has two parts. The first part is Gopadeva and the second part is ‘svāmin’. Gopadeva means ‘Lord of the cowherds’ and is often applied to Indra, Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu, mostly to the last two in the post-Vedic period. The second part ‘svāmin’ means ‘a spiritual proceptor, learned brāhmaṇa or Paṇḍita’ (used as a title at the end of names, especially of natives of the Karnataka).^6

जयभट्टिस्वामिन्
2. Jayabhaṭṭisvāmin (No. 40, L. 6): The first part of the name is Jayabhaṭṭi. Jaya literally means triumph or being victorious (in battle, lawsuit, etc.) It was also the name of Arjuna (the son of Pāṇḍu), Indra, the sun, of an attendant of Viṣṇu and of many sages.^7 Bhaṭṭa or Bhaṭṭi is affixed to the names of learned brāhmaṇas.^8 As explained above, the second part of the name svāmin is the surname added to the names of learned brāhmaṇas. Jayabhaṭṭisvāmin was a brāhmaṇa and has been mentioned as traividya in subsequent lines of the inscription^9 (L. 8; L. 9). Miscellaneous

अमृतदेव

The term can mean ‘the god Amṛtā’ which is the name of Lord Viṣṇu or we may call him ‘the god of nectar’ (Amṛtasya deva). It may also be explained as “Whose Lord is the nectar” or amṛtam devo'sya. He was an inhabitant of Ayodhyā.

देव
2. Deva (No. 16, L. 5): It is an abbreviated name without any surname. Literally it means ‘god, heavenly, divine’ (also said of terrestrial things of high excellence.)^10 It is also the name of men, and is used as a short form for Devadatta.^11 Deva of our inscription belonged to the community of the Caturvedins of the locality called Padmā in the town of Indrapura.

देवविष्णु
3. Devaviṣṇu (No. 16, L, 5): The first part is ‘Deva’ which means ‘god’. The second part is Viṣṇu which may be the name of his family deity. Devaviṣṇu belonged to the community of Caturvedins of the locality called Padmā in the city of Indrapura. He performed the Agnihotra of the Rāṇāyaṇīya Śakhā of the Vedas every day.

दुडिक
4. Duḍika (No. 16, L. 5): He was a brāhmaṇa belonging to the community of Caturvedins of the locality known as Padmā in the city of Indrapura. He has been mentioned as the great grand-father of the brāhmaṇa Dévaviṣṇu, the giver of an endowment for the maintenance of a lamp in the temple of the god Sun. It is an abbreviated name with the ending “ika”^12 like Devika for Devadatta; Yajñika for Yajñadatta and Chadika for Chandodatta.^13 The name ‘Ḍaḍḍa’, ‘Ḍuḍḍa’ or ‘Ḍuḍḍā’^14 cannot be derived from any Sanskrit root. Nor are these names found in any Sanskrit or Prakrit dictionary. Dr. H.D. Sankalia suggests that these names were derived from the Sanskrit term Dardara,^15 meaning ‘a mountain’, or a region having holes or ravines. The man may have shifted from a hilly region. We find references to geographical names like ‘Daddarapabbata’ and ‘Mahādaddara’ in the Daddara Jātaka.^16 The Daddarapabbata may be identified with the mountainous tract of Dardistan, lying to the north-west of Kashmir, and south of Little Pamir. Since the river Sindhu after its origin in the Himalayas near Tibet flows through this country, Pāṇini calls the river Dāradī Sindhuḥ.^17 The people of this tract, the Daradas are mentioned in the Mahābhārata in the list of the foreign tribes which sprang up along with the Yavanas, Mlecchas and Śakas, from the cow Kāmadhenu, when she was being forcibly driven away by Viśvāmitra from Vasiṣṭha's āśrama.^18 The Daradas are the people, living above Peshawar.^19 But the basic weakness in the suggestion made by Dr. H.D. Sankalia^20 is, as he himself admits, these names are not found in any Sanskrit or Prakrit dictionary. It may be noted that the words Ḍoḍa and Ḍoḍḍa are synonyms used for a brāhmaṇa and Ḍoḍiṇī stands for a brāhmaṇī, or a brāhmaṇa-woman.^21 These are deśya words and hence refer to local elements. In Punjabi language a person who is very simple or credulous or who can be very easily cheated is called ‘Ḍoḍa’. It is not unlikely that on account of his pious ways and bookish approach a brāhmaṇa was generally taken to be a simple person. In the Sanskrit story books the picture of a typical brāhmaṇa is that of a simpleton who can be easily duped. Hence it is possible that a brāhmaṇa was called ‘Ḍoḍa’ and the feminine form of ‘Ḍoḍa’ (i. e. Ḍoḍiṇī) was used for a brāhmaṇa-womaṇ.^22 In Karnataka ‘Ḍoḍḍu’ means ‘big’ or elder. ‘Ḍoḍḍācārya’ or ‘Ḍuḍḍācārya’ a term of respect for a learned Paṇḍita is also used in satire. It is interesting to note that Ḍaḍḍa is also an English slang word meaning ‘a foolish person’.

हरित्रात
5. Haritrāta (No. 16, L. 5): The first part of the name is Hari, which means ‘God’ and is also the name among others of Lord Viṣṇu and Kṛṣṇa. Generally Hari is derived from § hṛ’ to take away or remove evil or sin.^23 The second part ‘trāta’ means ‘protected’. Thus the whole literally means ‘protected by Hari’.^24 Haritrāta was a brāhmaṇa belonging to the community of the Caturvedins of the locality called Padmā in the town named Indrapura.

कर्प्पटिक
6. Karppaṭika^25 (No. 34, L. 6): The inscription records the purchase of land measuring one kulyavāpa by a brāhmaṇa, named Karppatika, for the purpose of his agnihotra rites. The word ‘Karpaṭika’ or Kārpaṭika means ‘acting deceitfully, fradulent, dishonest, a rogue, cheat’.^26 It also means a beggar.^27 Both the meanings may be applied here.

त्रैविद्य
7. Traividya (No. 40, L. 8; L. 9): His real name which occurs in L. 6 of the inscription was ‘Jayabhaṭṭisvāmin’. He was also known as Traividya The term literally means ‘one who knows the three Vedas<BR> -Ṛk, Sāma and Yajus’. NAMES OF JAINAS AND BAUDDHAS

अभयमित्र
1. Abhayamitra (No. 48, L. 2; No. 54, L. 2): The name consisting of two parts ‘abhaya’ and ‘mitra’ can mean a friend of unfearfulness or ‘an unfearful friend’. ‘Abhaya’ is also the name of Lord Śiva^28 and ‘mitra’ is a synonym for the god Sun. Thus it may also be a name formed by combining the names of two deities as in the case of Rāmakṛṣṇa. Abhayamitra was the name of a Buddhist monk who caused a pratimā to be built.

भद्र
2. Bhadra (No. 22, L. 4): It is the name of a Jaina Ācārya. Literally it means ‘blessed, auspicious, fortunate, prosperous, happy’. Bhadra is also the name of Lord Śiva.^29

भट्टिभव
3. Bhaṭṭibhava (No. 31, L. 2): The image on which the Mathurā Jaina Inscription of Kumāragupta I, of G. E. 113 is inscribed was set up by Śāmāḍhyā (Śyāmāḍhyā), the daughter of Bhaṭṭibhava. Bhaṭṭibhava seems to have been a brāhmaṇa-follower of Jainism. Bhaṭṭa or Bhaṭṭi, a surname meaning ‘a teacher’ has been put here before Bhava. Bhaṭṭi is the Prakritised form of Sanskrit ‘Bharti’ meaning a lord or master which came to be accepted as a Sanskrit word. ‘Bhava’ means ‘a god, deity’ and is also the name of Lord Śiva. Bhava also means ‘prosperity, welfare’.^30 Thus the full name literally means ‘one who is a (source of) prosperity, for his teacher’. It can also be a case of a name after the deity ‘Bhava’ or ‘Śiva’.

भट्टिसोम
4. Bhaṭṭisoma (No. 15, L. 6): It was the name of a Jaina worshipper. He is described as a mahātman the son of Somila who was a treasure-house of many virtues. The name Bhaṭṭi-soma literally means, “Who is just like a Soma (a life-giving element) for his teacher.” It can as well be a case of a name after the deity Soma.

बुद्धमित्र
5. Buddhamitra (No. 11, L. 1): ‘Buddha’ refers to ‘Lord Buddha’ and ‘mitra’ means friend. The whole thus literally means ‘a friend of Lord Buddha’. It is the name of a Buddhist monk.

दतिलाचार्य्य
6. Datilācāryya (No. 31, L. 2): He was a Jaina ācāryya. The correct form of the name should have been Dattilācārya. The word seems to be in a Prakritised form. According to Monier Williams^31 ‘Dattila’ is one of the forms of names terminating in ‘datta’. Names like Devadatta when contracted may turn into Dattila.^32 Ācāryya seems to be an epithet.

गोशर्म्मन्
7. Gośarmman (No. 22, LL. 4-5): ‘Go’ means cow and śarmman means ‘shelter or protection’.^33 Thus the whole may literally mean ‘one who is a shelter for the cows’. Ācāryya Gośarmman mentioned as a muni seems to have been a Jaina Ācāryya.

गुहनन्दिन्
8. Guhanandin (No. 39, L. 6; L. 13): The first part Guha is the name of Skanda^34 and the second part is nandin; meaning thereby, ‘one who is a servant of Lord Skanda’. Guhanandin was the name of a Jaina Ācāryya. The names of the Digaṁbara Ācāryas of the third and fourth centuries, such as Yaśonandin Jayanandin, and Kumāranandin generally end in nandin. As Puṇḍravardhana was one of the seats of Jaina pontiffs, beginning with Gupti-Gupta or Viśākhācāryya, the disciple of Bhadrabāhu II, it has been suggested that Guhanandin also belonged to the same place.^35

जितसेन
9. Jitasena (No. 52, L. 30): The first part of the name ‘Jita’ means ‘won’. ‘Sena’ the second part of the name, generally refers to an army but in the present case we may translate it better as ‘body’ which is supported by lexicographers.^36 Thus the whole may literally mean ‘One who has won the body’, i.e. one having control over one's senses’. This would suit the context because Jitasena was an ācāryya of the Buddhist order.^37

कपित
10. Kapita (No. 41, L. 6): It is a name based on colour. Kapila means ‘monkey-coloured’ or ‘yellow-coloured’. He was one of the teachers of the Māheśvara cult and has been mentioned as Bhagavān Kapila.

कुशिक
11. Kuśika (No. 41, L. 5): He is described as one of the pupils of Lakulin (Nakulin in the Vāyu Purāṇa), an incarnation of Maheśvara.^38 It is an abbreviated name formed by the addition of the surffix ‘ika’. According to lexicographers literally Kuśika means ‘squinteyed’.^39 In the present inscription the name has the epithet bhagavān prefixed to it.

मद्र
12. Madra (No. 15, L. 8): He was a follower of Jaina cult full of affection for brāhmaṇas and religious preceptors and ascetics and set up five stone images of Ādikartṛs or Tīrthaṁkaras, i.e. the five images in the niches of the column and the column itself, at the village of Kakubha, i.e., Kahaum. Madra is the name of a country to the north-west of Hindustan proper, or a king (pl. the people) of this country. It was also the name of a son of Śibi (the progenitor of the Madras).^40 Mādrī, we get the name of a princess of Madra.^41 Literally it means ‘joy’.^42

पराशर
13. Parāśara (No. 41, L. 6): He is mentioned as an ācārya of the Māheśvara cult. The epithet ‘Bhāgavan’ has been prefixed to his name. Literally Parāśara means ‘a crusher, destroyer’.^43 Parāśara is also the name of an ancient sage, an authority on Jyotiṣa, Kṛṣi, Vṛkṣāyurveda and Dharmaśāstra.

पार्श्व
14. Pārśva (No. 22, L. 3): The name has its origins in Pārśva or Pārśvanātha; the best of the Jinas. It is the name of the 23rd Arhat of the present cycle and his servant.^44

रुद्रसोम
15. Rudrasoma (No. 15, L. 7): He is the son of Bhaṭṭisoma who has been mentioned as a mahātmā. He is described as having another appellation of Vyāghra.^45 It may be a name formed by the combination of the names of two deities Rudra and Soma.

शंकर
16. Śaṁkara (No. 22, L. 6): It is the name of a Jaina monk^46, who installed an image of Pārśvanātha. Literally meaning ‘causing prosperity’, it is one of the common names of Lord Śiva.^47 The present case goes against the traditions of the Smṛtis which forbid the giving of the names of deities directly to human beings.

सनसिद्ध
17. Sanasiddha (No. 23, L. 1; L. 9): It was the name of an upāsaka. It seems to be a Prakritised form of Sanskrit ‘svayaṁ siddha’^48, meaning ‘existing on one's own strength’. Another possibility is that as ‘sana’ means ‘old, ancient’,^49 the whole may mean ‘Siddha’ of old’. It may be noted that in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa sanaśruta (meaning famous of old) appears as the name of a man.

शान्तिदेव
18. Śāntideva (No. 52. L. 4): He was a Buddhist monk of the Mahāyāna school and has been mentioned as Ācāryya Śāntideva.^50 The name Śāntideva was quite popular among the Buddhists. Literally the name means ‘the god of tranquillity or prosperity’.

सोमिल
19. Somila (No. 15, L. 6): It is the name of a follower of Jainism whose great grandson Madra is mentioned as having established the five excellent images referring to the five named Jaina Tirthaṁkaras sculptured on the column (viz., Ādinātha, Śāntinātha, Neminātha, Pārśvanātha and Mahāvīra).^51 Somila can be an abbreviated form of the name ‘Somadatta’.^52 In Punjabi usage a person named ‘Somadatta’ may be addressed as ‘Somī;’ Somila may be a similar form convenient to utter. Somila can also be formed by adding ‘ilac’ suffix to the word ‘Soma’ and hence meaning ‘full of Soma’. Somila was the name of a poet.^53 Kālidāsa also mentions a poet named Saumila (identical with Somila) along with Bhāsa.^54 In the Kathāsaritsāgara Somila is the name of an Asura.

उदिचार्य्य
20. Udi (tā) cāryya (No. 41, L. 8): Udita means ‘proclaimed’ or ‘high’^55 and ‘ācāryya’ means teacher, the whole literally meaning ‘a high teacher’. Ārya Uditācāryya was one of the ācāryyas of the Māheśvara cult, tenth from the Bhagavān Kuśika and fourth from the Bhagavān Parāśara.

उपमित
21. Upamita (No. 41, L. 7): Literally the name means “compared or illustrated by comparison”,^56 or in other words ‘one who is quoted for comparison, i.e., very high or perfect’.

बलि
1. Bali (No. 14, L. 2): The reference to Bali comes in connection with the praise of Lord Viṣṇu.^57 Literally meaning ‘one who is powerful or vigorous’, Bali was the son of Virocana and the grandson of Prahlāda and has been the king of the Asuras.^58 A famous legend about him runs thus<BR> -The demon Bali, by his austerities acquired the dominion over the three worlds, and caused annoyance and anxiety to the gods. Viṣṇu then reincarnated himself as a dwarf, appeared before Bali, and asked for as much land as he could cover with three strides. Bali assented to his request, and Viṣṇu with two strides covered the heavens and the earth, but, in commiseration for Bali, who then humbled himself, left him the dominion over the lower regions below the earth.^59 We get a reference to this legend as early as in the Viṣṇusūkta of the Ṛgveda.^60

बुद्ध
2. Buddha (No. 23, LL. 6-7): He has been given the epithet ‘The Divine’ (Bhagavān Buddha). He is mentioned in connection with a Buddhist temple. Literally the name means awakened, conscious or intelligent. For Buddhists it stands for a fully enlightened man who has achieved perfect knowledge of the truth and thereby is liberated from all existence and before his own attainment of Nirvāṇa reveals the method of obtaining it. The principal Buddha of the present age was born at Kapilavastu in the year 566 B.C.^61 His father Śuddhodana was the Rājā of that district. His mother was Māyādevī, and his original name was Siddhārtha. He belonged to the Kṣatriya Śākya tribe, while Gautama seems to refer to the race to which his family belonged. He had left his home in quest of truth and after a concentrated meditation for a few years attained the discovery of truths and was called the Buddha or the enlightened.^62

कृष्ण
3. Kṛṣṇa (No. 13, L. 13): It is a name based on colour, meaning black-dark, dark-blue. “Vasudeva, a descendant of Yadu and Yayāti, had by his second wife Devakī, eight sons of whom the last, Kṛṣṇa, was born with black-skin and a peculiar mark on his breast”.^63 Yaśodā was Kṛṣṇa's foster-mother to whom he was shifted in Gokula or Vraja immediately after his birth to escape the cruel hands of Kaṁsa. In our inscription Skandagupta has been compared with Lord Kṛṣṇa, who after slaying his enemy Kaṁsa had returned to his mother Devakī.^64

पार्थ
4. Pārtha (No. 17, L. 14; No. 19, L. 5): In No. 17, king Viśvavarman is compared with Pārtha in (heroic) deeds of war. In No. 19 Bhānugupta is described as a mighty king equal to Pārtha, exceedingly heroic. Pārtha is formed from Pṛthā and is a metronymic for Arjuna who has been mentioned in the Purāṇas, as the husband of Subhadrā and father of Abhimanyu.^65

पृथु
5. Pṛthu (No. 2, LL. 7-8): Samudragupta is stated to have surpassed the kings like Pṛthu and Rāghava in giving gold. Literally Pṛthu means broad, wide, expansive, extensive, spacious or large.^66 About nineteen Pṛthus have been mentioned in the Purāṇas,^67 the most important and famous being the Vainya. Here the reference seems to this Pṛthu, the Vainya. He is the son of Vena got out of by the churning his right arm by the sages to save him from falling into hell and is considered the ninth incarnation of Hari. He was the first king who introduced agriculture. Due to scarcity of supply when people complained of hunger, he armed his arrow and the earth was milked. Hilly tracts were levelled and different kinds of villages, cities and towns were organised for the first time. Pṛthu has been panegyrised by the Gandharvas, and Siddhas playing on different musical instruments.^68

राघव
6. Rāghava (No. 2, L. 8): Samudragupta is mentioned to have surpassed the kings like Pṛthu and Rāghava in giving gold.^69 Rāghava literally means a descendant of Raghu,^70 and is used as a patronymic of Aja, of Daśaratha and of Rāmacandra. In dual number (rāghavau) it refers to Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.^71

सगर
7. Sagara (No. 36, L. 12; No. 37, L. 21): He is mentioned in these inscriptions as a donor of lands.^72 Literally Sagara means ‘containing poison or poisonous’ It is the name of a king of the solar race, sovereign of Ayodhyā, son of Bāhu. He is said to have been called Sa-gara, as born together with a poison administered to his mother by the cowives of her husband. He was father of Asamañjasa by Keśinī and of sixty thousand sons by Sumati; the latter were turned into a heap of ashes by the sage Kapila, and their funeral ceremonies could only be performed by the waters of Gaṅgā to be brought from heaven for the purpose of purifying their remains; this was finally accomplished by Bhagīratha.^73

व्यास
8. Vyāsa (No. 28, L. 21; No. 29, L. 14; No. 36, L. 15; No. 43, L. 30; No. 44, L. 21; No. 52, LL. 11-12): Vyāsa has been mentioned as Bhagavān (venerable) Vyāsa in No. 28; as Dvaipāyana in No. 29 and as Vedavyāsa in No. 44. In No. 43, there is a reference to his saying in the Mahābhārata.^74 In No. 52 he is described as the compiler of the Vedas and as a son of Parāśara.^75 Literally Vyāsa means ‘division or extension’ and as the name of a person it signifies an arranger, complier or narrator. Vyāsa is said to have rearranged the Vedas into four parts, and taught each of them to four respective pupils<BR> -Paila, Vaiśaṁpāyana, Jaimini and Sumantu; he also rearranged Itihāsa<BR> -Purāṇas and composed the Bhārata and the Bhāgavata.^76 Subsequently, the name Vyāsa came to be applied to any great typical compiler or author.^77 He was the son of the sage Parāśara and was brought forth by his mother Satyavatī on an island in the river Yamunā. Hence he is also known as Dvaipāyana and Bādarāyaṇa.^78 As he was called KṛṣṇaDvaipāyana, it seems that Vyāsa, Dvaipāyana, and Bādarāyaṇa were epithets; his original name might have been Kṛṣṇa due to his dark complexion,^79 and he was called ‘Dvaipāyana for being born on an island (dvīpa).’

युधिष्ठिर
9. Yudhiṣṭhira (No. 28, L. 24; No. 29, L. 16; No. 35, L. 12; No. 36, L. 17; No. 43, L. 33; No. 44, L. 24; No. 52, L. 14): He is mentioned in the imprecatory verses and is described as the best of kings. Literally meaning ‘firm or steady in battle’, it was the name of the eldest of the five sons of Pāṇḍu. He was father of Prativindhya and Sudhanu and before his death installed his grandson Parīkṣita on the throne (at Hastinapur) and Vajra at Mathurā.^80

दामस्वामिनी
1. Dāmasvāminī (No. 55, LL. 3-4): She is said to have raised a pillar in the memory of her dead parents at Rājghāṭ in Vārāṇasī. The first part of the name, Dāman, means a ‘rope’ or ‘girdle’^1 (originally ‘bond’, from §dā ‘to bind’). But the Amarakośa gives a better explanation which takes us nearer to the original meaning. It explains ‘Dāman’ as ‘Sandānam’, i. e., a rope tethered to a cow at the time of milking it.^2 The second part of the name is ‘svāminī’ which means ‘a proprietress, mistress’ or owner of (gen., loc. or comp.).^3 The parents might have given her this name out of affection as she was a helping hand in tethering the rope to the cow while milking it.^4 The name indicates affection by the parents.

देवकी
2. Devakī (No. 13, L. 13): The reference comes in the passage which describes how Skandagupta returned victorious to his mother just as Lord Kṛṣṇa went to Devakī after killing his enemy. ^5 Sewell suggests that the name of Skandagupta's mother was Devakī and he has been followed by some other scholars. According to D.C. Sircar the simile may further suggest that some maternal uncle of Skandagupta actually fought against him in support of his rival and that his mother, possibly not the chief queen of his father, had to experience difficulties for sometime. ^6 Devakī is a patronymic formed by adding ‘ī’ suffix to Devaka, literally meaning ‘divine, celestial’, who was her father.^7 She was the wife of Vasudeva and the mother of Kṛṣṇa.^8

हरिस्वामिनी
3. Harisvāminī (No. 23, LL. 1, 10): Upāsikā (lay-worshipper) Harisvāminī, was the wife of Upāsaka Sanasiddha who donated money to the Ārya-saṁgha (community of the faithful) at the great vihāra (Buddhist convent) of Kākanādaboṭa (i. e., the great stūpa at Sāñcī) for feeding one Bhikṣu everyday and maintaining lamps in the shrines of the Buddha.^9 The first part of the name, Hari, stands alike for Lord Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu and Śiva. The second part is ‘Svāminī’ meaning mistress. Thus the whole literally means ‘one who has Hari as her master’.

पद्मावती
4. Padmāvatī (No. 22, L. 5): She was the mother of Śaṁkara, an ascetic, under whose instructions the image of the Jina-vara-pārśvanātha was made. In the inscription we have the un-Pāṇinian use of the locative ‘Padmāvatau’ in place of ‘Padmāvatyām’ but it seems to have been done to suit the metre. Padmāvatī is a synonym far Lakṣmī. In India it has been a popular name for women.^10

रामी
5. Rāmī (No. 28, LL. 4, 12, 17): She has been mentioned as the wife of a brāhmaṇa, named Nāthaśarman. Rāmī means ‘darkness or night’. ^11 It may mean ‘a woman of dark complexion’ or it can be a patronymic from Rāma.^12 Monier Williams mentions the form with short ‘i’ suffix (Rāmi) but it can be with long ‘ī’ as well, as we have ‘Devakī’ a patronymic from Devaka.^13 Chatterji mentions it to be a feminine form of Rāma and considers it a naming pattern prevalent among the lower classes^14

साभाटि
6. Sābhāṭi (No. 55, L. 3): The form of the name should have better been Sabhāṭi. She was the mother of Dāmasvāminī who raised a pillar in her memory. The name seems to have some relation with the word Sabhā.^15 It can be an adjective from the word Sabhā combined with §‘aṭ’ to move. Literally it may mean “one who moves in assemblies”.

शामाढ्या
7. Śāmāḍhyā (No. 31, L. 2): Śāmāḍhyā is a Prakritized form of the word ‘Śyāmāḍhyā’. She was the daughter of Bhaṭṭib hava and the wife of the ferryman Grahamittrapālita. The first part śāma’ is a contraction of Sanskrit ‘Śyāma’.^16 Literally the name may mean ‘Śyāmena āḍhyā’, i. e., having a dark or swarthy complexion which in Sanskrit poetic tradition is considered a mark of beauty.^17 

आभीर
1. Ābhīra (No. 1, L. 22): They were one of the tribes subdued by Samudragupta. Ābhīras lived to the north of the Rajaputana desert. We may also think of Abiravan between Herat and Kandahar which may have been the original home of the Ābhīras. In the 3rd century A.D. there was an Ābhīra kingdom in the northwestern Deccan.^21 D.C. Sircar^22 describes Ābhīra in singular as a member of the Cowherd Community. The tribe can still be traced in the present Ahīras,^23 who in tribal groups, abound largely in the Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Nepal and some portions of Rajasthan. They are a band of simple, sturdy people, mostly cowherds and agriculturists.^24 This tribe^25 is thought to have played a big part in the propagation of the worship of Kṛṣṇa Govinda^26 in his pastoral aspect. The Mahābhārata^27 places the Ābhīras in West Rajasthan ‘where the Sarasvatī disappears’. In the first and second centuries A.D. they are located in the country between the lower Sindhu valley and Kathiawar, as is indicated in the ‘Periplus’ and in the Geography of Ptolemy.^28 The Periplus calls their country Abiria. Ābhīra generals served in the armics of Śaka Kṣatraps of Western India in the second century A.D. as is known from their inscriptions.^29 They are also mentioned in the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali^30 in association with the Śūdras, the Sodrai of Alexander's time, who lived in northern Sind. Throughout the third century A.D. the Ābhīras exercised ruling power in northern Konkan and Mahārāshtra.^31 Vātsyāyana^32 refers to the Harem of the Ābhīra kings. The Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa^33 and the Vāyu Purāṇa^34 refer to them as ‘Dakṣiṇāpatha-vāsinaḥ’ or dwelling in the Southern Country. The Bṛhat-saṁhitā^35 mentions them as being under the jurisdiction of Śani (Saturn). The Jodhpur Inscription of Saṁvat 918, records that the Ābhīra people of this area were a terror to their neighbours, because of their violent demeanour.^36 The Ābhīra robbers are also mentioned in the Skanda Purāṇa.^37 Epigraphic evidence indicates the existence of an Ābhīra kingdom in the 14th Century in Khandesh.^38 In the Sāhitya Darpaṇa of Viśvanātha,^39 it is stated that Ābhīrī is the language of the Ābhīras and Cāṇḍālī of the Caṇḍālas. Those who do woodwork can speak Ābhīrī or Śābarī, either of the two. Daṇḍin asserts that the speeches of the Ābhīras, etc., are termed as Apabhraṁśa in the Kāvya^40 on the basis of which probably Keith writes: “the Prakrit lyrics passed into Apabhraṁśa as a result of the activities of the Ābhīras and the Gurjaras.^41 We know from the Amarakośa^42 that ‘Ābhīrī’ was used to denote ‘Ābhīra woman or the wife of a cowherd’. The Amarakośa^43 mentions Gopa, Gopāla, Gosaṁkhya, Godhuk and Ballava as the synonyms for Ābhīra and says that the village or place where Ābhīras lived is named as Ghoṣa or Ābhīrapallī.^44 In the Kashmirian recension of the Mahābhārata we get the readings ‘Kābhīra’ and ‘Kabhīra’ in place of Ābhīra.^45 These Kashmirian forms may have resulted from an attempt to record an initial glottal opening in the language of the Ābhīras. The Kasmiras probably knew the Ābhīras at an early date.^46 Bhattacharya^47 describes the Ābhīrs or Ahīrs as a cowherd caste exceeding 8,000,000, and found almost everywhere in India north of the Narmadā. The Ābhīras are mentioned as foreigners in the Purāṇas.^48 Their kings were regarded as vrātya and mostly śūdras (black).^49 In the Mahābhārata the Ābhīras are called Mleccha.^50 According to Manu^51 they were the sons of a brāhmaṇa man and an ambaṣṭha woman, the Ambaṣṭhas being of mixed origin and known as the Ānava kṣatriyas.^52 The Bṛhatsaṁhitā^53 places the Ābhīras in the Southern quarter of India. Shafer^54 considers them to be an admixture possibly of white Iranian blood with enough Bhil blood to give them a a very dark colour and concludes that they were western Ānavas.^55

आर्जुनायनस्
2. Ārjunāyanas (No. 1, L. 22): One of the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta. The name Ārjuneya is mentioned in the Ṛgveda as the patronymic of Kautsa.^56 The tribe, associated with the name of Arjuna, existed in the Punjab and the North-West up to the advent of Gupta power in the fourth century A.D.^57 The word Arjuna in the Vedic literature^58 denotes ‘white’ and ‘white lepresy’ and is also an epithet of Indra. But it does not denote a tribe or a human hero. The word Arjuna has an unmistakable resemblance with the Śaka word erzuna, meaning a ‘leader’ or ‘chief’ which is derived from arzi. Analogous to it are the Śaka words aljsā, meaning ‘silvery’ and āljsata, meaning ‘silver’, that are akin to the Avestan word erezata (silver), the Sanskrit word rajata (silver) and the Persian word arziz (tin).^59 All these words have the original sense of whiteness and brightness, that are also connoted by the word arjuna in Sanskrit. It is highly significant that Arjuna, the hero of the Mahābhārata, is said to have borne this name, because he was ‘white’ and ‘pure’ in action.^60 All over the Eurasian steppes the nobles were regarded as ‘white’ and the commoners were considered ‘black’. Hence the word for white colour was employed to denote the idea of leadership. This is why erzuna was used in the sense of a ‘leader’ in Śaka languages.^61 Vedic and Śaka both branched from the same parent IndoEuropean language. Hence many words were common to both. But whereas arjuna in Vedic lost its pristine sense and was only used as an adjective, signifying ‘whiteness’, in Śaka it meant a ‘tribe’ and a human hero and later on this sense was imparted to this word in India as a result of the impact of the Śakas.^62 The tribe, bearing the name of Arjuna, was also connected with some people of Chinese Turkestan, whose heroes, and kings had this designation.^63 In the Uighur redaction of the Hiḍimbāvadha^64 the name of Arjuna occurs in the form of Arcuni.^65 According to Sylvain Levi, this episode of the Mahābhārata owed the privilege of entering into the Turkish world to the presence of the name of Arjuna in it, who was regarded as the eponymous founder of the dynasties of some Central Asiatic oases-states.^66 Pāṇini^67 refers to the worshipper of Arjuna, called Arjunaka, together with the devotee of Vasudeva, called Vāsudevaka. This remark implies that Arjuna was treated as a deity at the time of Pāṇini and his followers occupied a prominent position. ^68 The Kāśikā replaces Auddālakāyana of Patañjali by Ārjunāyana,^69 the name of a tribe nearer to its own time in discussing the meaning of Prācya-bhārata (II. 4. 66). From the accounts relating to the invasion of India by Alexander we learn that a tribe named Agalassoi (Arjunāyana) fought with Alexander.^70 The Bṛhat-saṁhitā^71 places the Ārjunāyana in the northern division of India and describes them as being in the region of Bṛhaspati.^72 Ptolemy refers to a people in the Punjab whom he calls Pandoouoi^73 = Pāṇḍavas with whom the Ārjunāyanas may be connected.^74 Ārjunāyana coins are found in the Mathurā region and ‘they may be assigned with probability to the region lying west of Agra and Mathura, equivalent, roughly speaking, to the Bharatpur and Alwar States’.^75

आटविकराज
3. Āṭavika-rāja (No. 1, L. 21): It is stated in the inscription that Samudragupta made all the kings of the forest countries his servants.^76 A mention of the forest kingdoms has also been made in Khoh Copper plate inscription of Saṁkshobha Gupta year 209.^77 These 18 forest kingdoms were apparently in Central India including Ḍāhala or the Jabalpur region. ^78 We find a reference to the same in the Kanas plate of Lokavigraha.^79 The Vāyu and Matsya Purāṇas (XLV, 126 and CXIII, 48) read Āṭavyas which is no doubt the correct reading. Āṭavī as a city of the Deccan is mentioned in the Mahābhārata.^80 The Āṭavyas were certainly the same as the Āṭavikas of the Allahabad Pillar Inscription and were perhaps aboriginal tribes dwelling in the jungle tracts of Central India.^81 We find a reference to the Āṭavikas or the forest savages in the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya and it was an Arthaśāstra practice to hire the Āṭavikas as scouts and army auxiliaries,^82 which needs must influence their future advance to civilization. Āṭavika-rāja should be translated as ‘forest-kings’ or ‘kings of forest countries’. We get a reference to Jāṅgalas in the Puranic List of Peoples.^83 Similar terms ‘vana-rāṣṭra’ ‘forest-countries’ and vana-rājya ‘forest-kingdoms’ also occur in the BṛhatSaṁhitā.^84 But these countries lay in the north-east division of India, as mapped out by Varāhamihira, and they are, at any rate, not the countries referred here.^85 In the Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata, in one line of Sahadeva's digvijaya, Professor Franklin Edgerton changes Āṭavī to Antākhi, so that the line will refer to Antioch, Rome and the Greeks. Antioch, Rome and Greece were intimately associated in history and consequently they are still associated in the minds of Western scholars, and hence Antākhi made more sense to Edgerton in connection with Rome and the Greeks than Āṭavī. But it only represents his personal opinion.^86

दैवपुत्र
4. Daivaputra^87 (No. 1, L. 23): Daivaputras along with Ṣāhis, Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas and Muruṇḍas are mentioned to have paid homage to Samudragupta by rendering to him all kinds of service. The word ‘Daivaputra’ denotes those ‘who belong to devaputra’, i. e., Kaniṣka, i. e., the Kuṣāṇa ruler. The title devaputra has frequently been used as a title by the Kuṣāṇa kings.^88 The common belief is that the designation devaputra ‘godson’ was copied by the Kuṣāṇas from the ancient Chinese imperial title, ‘T’ien-tzu’, ‘son of heaven’.^89 Thomas considers that this title used by the Kuṣāṇas must have been borrowed from the Hsiung-nu (a Central Asian Tribe) and not directly from the Chinese.^90 Narain also believes the title to have been borrowed by the Kuṣāṇas from Central Asia.^91 The title has been frequently used by the kings in the Kharoṣṭhī documents discovered from Chinese Turkestan.^92 As regards the origin of the title, the divinity of the kings has been stressed upon in many ancient empires.^93 The ancient Indian concept for ‘Deva putra’^94 meaning ‘god-son’ is slightly different. It was not used for worldly kings but specifically for a class of distinguished divinites, which in Indian Buddhist texts was specifically used for four regional ‘great kings’, i. e., regents of four quarters, East, West, North and South who were ‘sons of heaven’. In the later Kuṣāṇa times, the term seems to have denoted the sense of Royal insignia.^95 In a Buddhist text of this period the question is raised ‘why kings are called devaputra’ and the answer is that before being born as a man, he was abiding among the gods (devas) and that, because the thirty-three gods (each) contributed to his substance, therefore, he is ‘god-son’.^96 That Daivaputra denotes the Kuṣāṇas is obvious, since, no other Indian king is known to have been styled ‘devaputra’. Though Indian kings were usually addressed as ‘Deva’, we do not find any evidence of an Indian king referring to himself as deva. The Kuṣāṇas did not adopt devaputra as an official title in early times. It is totally absent from their coins, its reading on one coin of Kujula Kara Kaphsa being an error which has been noticed by Thomas after re-examining the coin in consultation with Allan.^97 Kaniṣka has not used the title even in Peshawar Casket Inscriptions which were officially engraved. It is only in documents inscribed by Indians that the title ‘devaputra’ is used for the Kuṣāṇa kings.^98 The title is used for the first time for Kaniṣka (known as Candana Kaniṣka).^99 Mahārāja -rājātirāja devaputra Kuṣāṇa of the Taxila Silver Scroll Inscription is generally taken to refer to Kaniṣka.^100 As rightly observed by Thomas “the devaputrasa of the scroll inscription is the first known instance of the application to the Kuṣāṇas of the designation devaputra, which regularly, though not invariably, recurs with Kaniṣka and his successors.”^101 Thus we do not find the title Devaputra being used by the Kuṣāṇa rulers themselves but was applied to them by the Indians. Why of all ruling dynasties only the Kuṣāṇas were designated as ‘Devaputras’ is really inexplicable. Thomas suggests two possibilities. It may be due to the fact that the Indians saw some similarity between the figures of the grand Yakṣa and those of the burly Kusāṇa kings and the superior title of ‘Devaputra’ may have appeared to be a suitable appel lation. Another possibility is that they found some similarity between the Kuṣāṇa kings and Kubera (described in India as regent of the north and god of wealth and known as Devaputra in ancient Indian concept of Devaputra which simply means god-son), especially in view of the lavish gold coinage of the Kuṣāṇas. Aśvaghoṣa refers to the ‘great king Kanika’ as ‘guardian of the northern heaven’.^102 It is also likely that the title devaputra may have been given due to Śiva-maheśvara, whom we have seen styled as Devaputra and who is the sole deity figured on the coins of Wima Kadphises.^103 These facts need further investigation. Most probably from the Epic Period, Indian concept of Devaputra ‘god-son’ is linked with kings to give them divinity and not as a title.^104 Aśoka could claim the title only of ‘Devānām priya’^105 meaning ‘the beloved of the gods’. Thus Devaputra or ‘god-son’ was a superior title given to the Kuṣāṇas by Indians. It is interesting to note that the epithet Devaputravat has been used for Buddha in one of our inscriptions^106

हूण
5. Hūṇa (No. 13, L. 15): They are mentioned in the Bhītarī Stone Pillar Inscription of Skandagupta in which Skandagupta (A.D. 455<BR> -467) is stated to have inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Hūṇas: “By whose (Skandagupta's) two arms the earth was shaken, when he, the creator (of a disturbance like that) of a terrible whirlpool, joined in close conflict with the Hūṇas...”.^107 The defeat inflated upon the Hūṇas proved so decisive that for nearly half a century the Gupta empire was immune from their depredations.^108 Hūṇas, also known as Ephthalites or Hiung-nu were a Central Asian tribe. Uigur^109 transcribes the name of the tribe in ancient Chinese in two phonetic forms: one of which is ‘xūnu or xunu’, the other ‘xunux, xunuo, xunu’. The first part (xun<BR> -) of the last form is not in doubt and neither is the u of the last part, the only question is about the change of the initial i of ancient Chinese into y in Uigur before u and in Sandhi, and about the pronunciation of the final consonant.^110 The first of the above Chinese forms which comes as close to the Hunu as to the Sanskrit Hūṇa is very similar to the Chinese “transcription” Xunu or Xūnu, and Avesta Hunu, except the Sanskrit has substituted for the final root vowel ‘u’ the stem final<BR> -a characteristic of the names of peoples in that language. “The Purāṇas have a form Urṇa which together with Epic Skr. Hūṇa suggests Indic Hūrṇa Turk, Xūrnu”.^111 We may note here the Tibetan Hor, which corresponds with the first syllable of the reconstructed form Hūr-ṇa. The difference of vowels may indicate a back dipthong or back vowel between o and u, as Ptolemy's Xoūnoi suggests, since the Greeks wrote u (y) for Indic u.^112 Though all the above forms go back to one primitive form, we cannot say the same for the people to whom they were applied. The general opinion is that the Hsiung-nus, Huns, Hūṇas etc., were Turks. Some scholars consider them to have been a mixture of many tribes, Iranians, Mongols, and Paleosibirians (ancestors of the Yenissei-ostyaks). Whatever may have been the dominant race or speech was, it can be seen that there must have been several subject people and subject armies in such far-flung empires, necessitating some mixture and mutual influence<BR> -ethnic, linguistic and cultural.^113 Otto Maenchen-Helfen has discussed the whole question on the basis of the evidence of language, history, ethnology, and archaeology^114 and has pointed out that the greater part of the Hsiung-nu vocabulary pointed to Mongol^115 Later Pelliot considered the same vocabulary and established that the Hsiung-nu and Huns were Turks.^116 Louis Bazin^117 and Von Gabain^118 also reached the conclusion that in language of the Hsiung-nu there was a high percentage of Turkish words.^119 In the second century B.C. the Hiung-nu (Huns) started a movement near the Chinese frontier and succeeded in destroying the Greco-Bactrian empire, in strongly menacing the existence of the house of Arsakes, and in landing crowds of Central Asian invaders within the borders of India. In the latter half of the fourth century A.D., a brach of them, the White Huns, or Ephthalites, flooded the South of Asia; and ‘about the time when the last legions of Rome shattered on the plains of Chalons, the motley hordes of Attila, the White Huns had begun to tread Sassanian Persia under the hoofs of their horses, and were soon to smash the Indian empire of the Guptas into pieces’.^120 In A.D. 484 the Hūṇas killed the Sassanian ruler of Persia. Towards the close of the fifth century A.D. they ruled over a vast empire with their principal capital at Balkh.^121 We know of a Hūṇa-deśa placed to the South of the Kāma-giri and to the North of Maru-deśa, i. e., the desert called the land of heroes. The Harṣacarita places the Hūṇa country in the Punjab region practically suggesting the same area.^122 In the middle of the sixth century A.D., the Sassanian king of Persia made an alliance with Western Turks against the Hūṇas and smashed their rule from the Oxus by killing their king sometime between A.D. 563 and 567.^123 We know of Toramāṇa from his Eraṇ Boar Inscription^124 and of Mihirakula from his Gwalior Inscription.^125 These two are generally taken to have been Hūṇa chiefs. There is another inscription found at Kura (Salt range in the Punjab) refering to Rājādhirāja Mahārāja Toramāṇa-Ṣāhi-Jau (bla), whom some scholars identify with king Toramāṇa mentioned in the Eraṇ Inscription,^126 but others regard the two as quite different.^127 Here it must be pointed out, none of these inscriptions describes any of these kings as Hūṇas nor contains any reference to the Hūṇas. We find an interesting account of Toramāṇa in the Jain work, Kuvalayamālā, composed to 700 Śaka (A.D. 778).^128 Here Toramāṇa is stated to have lived on the bank of the Candrabhāgā (Chenab river). His guru Hari-gupta, who himself was a scion of the Gupta family, also lived there.^129 Both Toramāṇa and Mihirakula are referred to in the Rājataraṅgiṇī, but there is no mention of their being the Hūṇas. It is doubtful whether Toramāṇa and Mihirakula were Hūṇas or Kuṣāṇas. Sir Aurel Stein, Jayaswal^130 and Fleet^131 held that Toramāṇa was a Kuṣāṇa. But Sten Konow^132 holds that Toramāṇa was, in all probability, a Hūṇa, as is generally assumed, and not a Kuṣāṇa. It is not unlikely that the Hūṇas and the Kuṣāṇas were ethnically allied and were later merged into a new nation, which came to be known as Hūṇa in India.^133 There are several stray references to the Hūṇas in Indian literature. D.C. Sircar^134 opines that the Indian names Hūṇa, Hārahūṇa or Hārahūra, supposed to be associated with the Chinese name Hiung-nu and ‘the White Hun’ of the European writers, are mentioned in a few late passages of the Mahābhārata and in the geographical sections of the early Purāṇas, can be roughly assigned to the 4th century A.D. A sūtra-vṛtti in the Candra Vyākaraṇa has the sentence ‘ajayad-gupta (or Japto or Jarto) Hūṇān’ as an illustration of the use of the imperfect to express an event which occurred within the life-time of the author.^135 In the Mandasor inscription of Yaśodharman^136 a reference is made to the chiefs of the Hūṇas, but they are not named. The inscription simply says that Yaśodharman possessed countries which not even the Guptas and the chiefs of the Hūṇas could subdue.^137 The inscription also refers to Mihirakula “who had earlier bowed only to the god Sthāṇu (Śiva) and whose forehead was pained through being bent low down by the strength of the arm of Yaśodharman in the act of compelling obeisance”.^138 With the fall of Yaśodharman, which probably took place not long after, Mihirakula again came to the forefront. In the early part of the sixth century A.D. Śākala become his capital.^139 The Gupta king who then occupied the imperial throne was probably Narasiṁha-Gupta Bālāditya. He was temporarily overwhelmed by the victorious raids of Yaśodharman, and Mihirakula evidently took advantage of this imperial crisis to extend his power. Narasiṁhagupta, according to Hiuen Tsang, was forced to the humiliating position of paying tribute to Mihirakula but finally triumphed over his rival.^140 The defeat of Mihirakula appears to have finally crushed the political supremacy of the Hūṇas in India who ceased to be even a disturbing element in Indian History.^141 The Purāṇas place the Hūṇas in the extreme west, with the Sauvīras, Saindhavas, Śākalas and Madras.^142 In the Raghuvaṁśa, Kālidāsa mentions Raghu defeating the Hūṇas on the banks of the Vaṅkṣu or the Oxus^143, the (pale) faces of whose wives spoke of the bravery of their husbands (who died in the battle).^144 Varāhamihira^145 mentions them under the jurisdiction of Ketu and places them in the North.^146 Dr. Upendra Thakur^147 remarks that about the sixth century A.D., the Hūṇas almost lost their original name of Hiong-nou or Huns. Later the powerful Turks give its name to the entire Hūṇa nation by which they were further known in the neighbouring nations. Afterwards they were submerged in the Mongols under the influence of the powerful Mongol Chief Chengiz Khan. Thus, the Hiong-nou or Huns received different names in different periods beginning with their origin to their advancement in other countries. In spite of the copious references to the Ephthalites in the accounts of the different countries, it is very difficult to determine their exact origin and ethnic affinities. We can partly agree with Dr. Thakur as regards their merger in the area later dominated by the Turks and Mongols but the Hūṇas find their mention in the Harṣa-Carita of Bāṇa (a seventh century work) and they remained a potent force in the social and political life of the Punjab-Rajasthan-MalwaGujarat region during the early medieval period as evidenced by a large number of epigraphical and literary records, and also proved themselves as a source of danger to the Pāla kings of Bengal^148

काकस्
6. Kākas (No. 1, L. 22): One of the tribes who paid homage to Samudragupta. The Kākas are mentioned in the Mahābhārata^149 and are associated with the Vidarbhas, a well-known people occupying tracts of territory in modern Madhya Pradesh.^150 V.A. Smith connects them with Kākanāda near Sāñcī;^151 while the Bombay Gazetteer identifies them with Kākupur near Bithur. ^152 They may have been neighbours of the Sanakānīkas.^153

खरपरिकस्
7. Kharaparikas (No. 1, L. 22): One of the tribes who were subjugated by Samudragupta. D.R. Bhandarkar^154 takes them to be the Kharparas mentioned in the Batihagadh Inscription^155 of the Damoh district of M.P. Kharpara^156 means a thief, a rogue or a cheat. The name Kharaparika does not occur elsewhere in inscriptions or literature. The Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa^157 mentions a tribe called Khara-sāgara-rāśīs,^158 along with the Gandharas and the Yaudheyas; and the Matsya Purāṇa^159 refers to a country named Kharapatha, watered by the river Nalinī. It is difficult to say whether Khara-sāgara-rāśī and Kharapatha had anything to do with the Kharaparikas.^160 K.P. Jayaswal expresses the probability of the identification of the Kharaparikas with the five Karpaṭas of the Mahābhārata.^161

कोतस्
8. Kotas (No. 1, L. 14): The Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta mentions Samudragupta's capturing a king born in the family of the Kotas.^162 Mookerji equates the Kota-kulaja of the inscription with king Kalyāṇavarman of the play ‘Kaumudī-Mahotsava’.^163 But it is now generally believed^164 that ‘the episode of the Kaumudī-Mahotsava has no bearing whatsoever on the early Gupta History’. The coins of the Kotas bearing their name have been found in East Punjab, and Delhi, and ‘they probably ruled in the Upper Gangetic valley’.^165 Scholars differ in their views about placing the Kotas; some identify it with Kanyakubja while others with Pāṭaliputra.^166 It is known that Puṣpapura or Kusumapura was the name of both the Pāṭaliputra and Kānyakubja.^167 It must, however, be noted that the city of Puṣpa here is connected mainly with Samudragupta and not with the Kota-kulaja,^168 so the location of the city of the Kotas is not to be traced in Kusumapura or Puṣpapura. It is well known that Candragupta I received Magadha through his Licchavi-alliance and it is possible that Samudragupta enjoyed his youth playfully at Pāṭaliputra (Puṣpa-āhvaye krīḍatā). So Goyal's assumption that ‘Hariṣeṇa has referred to Kānyakubja and not Pāṭaliputra’^169 is incorrect. It is only later that Kānyakubja gains the honour of being called Kusumapura when the glory of Pāṭaliputra had started declining.^170 In view of the context of the victory over Kota-kulaja along with the Nāga kings Acyuta and Nāgasena and with the support of numismatic evidence it may be said that the kotas lived somewhere between East Punjab and Delhi.

कुरुस्
9. Kurus (No. 22, L. 7): The Kurus were divided into two branches, the Northern and the Southern.^171 We have here a reference to the Uttarakurus.^172 The Kurus were one of the most ancient and prominent of the Indo-Āryan kṣatriya tribes.^173 In the earliest literature the Kurus do not appear under that name as a people. But mention is made of a prince, Kuruśravaṇa (Glory of the Kurus)^174 and of a Pākasthāman Kauravyāyaṇa.^175 The Atharvaveda^176 refers to Parīkṣita as a king of the Kurus and his son, Janamejaya, is mentioned in the Śātapatha Brāhmaṇa^177 as one of the great performers of the horse sacrifice. Oldenberg^178 seems to be right in suggesting that the Kuru people, as known later, included some of the tribes referred to by other names in the Ṛgveda. Kuruśravaṇa, shown by his name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the Ṛgveda called Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ who is well known as a king of the Purus. Moreover, it is likely that the Tṛtsu-Bharatas, who appear in the Ṛgveda as enemies of the Purus, later coalesced with them to form the Kuru people.^179 Moreover, there is evidence that the Bharatas occupied the territory in which the Kurus were later found. Two of them are spoken of in a hymn of the Ṛgveda^180 as having kindled fire on the Dṛṣadvatī, the Āpayā, and the Sarasvatī<BR> -that is to say, in the sacred places of the later Kurukshetra.^181 In the Brāhmaṇa literature, the Kurus are often connected with Pāñcālas.^182 The territory of the Kuru-Pāñcālas is declared in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa to be the middle country (Madhyadeśa).^183 A group of the Kuru people still remained further north<BR> -the Uttara Kurus beyond the Himalayas.^184 It appears from a passage of the Śātapatha Brāhmaṇa that the speech of the Northerners-that is, presumably the Northern Kurus-and of the Kuru<BR> -Pāñcālas was similar, and regarded as specially pure.^185 There seems little doubt that the Brahmanical Culture was developed in the country of the Kuru-Pāñcālas, and that it spread thence east, south and west. ^186 The Uttara Kurus, who play a mythical part in the Epic and later literature, are still a historical people in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.^187 where they are located beyond the Himalayas (pareṇa Himavantam). In another passege,^188 however, the country of the Uttara Kurus is stated by Vasiṣṭha Sāthavya to be a land of the gods (deva-kṣetra), but Jānṁtapi Atyarāti was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not wholly mythical. It is reasonable to accept Zimmer's view that the northern Kurus were settled in Kashmir, especially as Kurukshetra is the region where tribes advancing from Kashmir might naturally be found.^189 In Buddhist literature, UttaraKuru is very often mentioned as a mythic region, but there are some passages which go to show that there was a faint memory of a country that once had a historical existence.^190 Some time before the fourth century B.C., the monarchical constitution of the Kurus gave place to a republic, for we are told by Kauṭilya^191 that the Kurus were ‘rāja-śabdopajīvinaḥ’, or ‘enjoying the status of rājan’<BR> -i. e. all citizens had equal rank and rights.^192 Shafer^193 shows that only the upper castes of the Kauravas were Āryan, the bulk of the population were probably nonĀryan as is clear from the fact that whereas the Kauravas rallied the support mostly of the non-Āryans, the Pāṇḍavas had the support of Āryans and concludes that the Northern Kurus were Muṇḍic.^194

10. Licchavis (No. 1, L. 29; No. 4, L. 7; No. 10, L. 4; No. 12, L. 18; No. 13, L. 3: No. 21, L. 5; No. 40, L. 4; No. 47, L. 2; No. 49, L. 2; No. 50, L. 2; No. 53, L. 2): The epithet ‘Licchavi-dauhitra’ (daughter's son of the Licchavi) for Samudragupta occurs in all these Gupta records It suggests the importance of Candragupta I's marriage with the Licchavi princess Kumāradevī. The alliance had no social importance but it was important for political gain by virtue of which Candragupta I (Samudragupta's father) gained powerful position in Magadha and the neighbouring countries. In the Candragupta-Kumāradevī-coins, we have no mention of the Guptas but only of the Licchavis in plural ‘Licchavayaḥ’ (the Licchavis). This supports the amalgamation of the Guptas with the Licchavis and we may agree with Majumdar that ‘the epithet Licchavi dauhitra was deliberately given to Samudragupta to emphasize his right of succession to the dual monarchy’.^195 We also know of a house of the Licchavis at Nepal^196 but the separate reference to Nepal as a tributary province in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta^197 proves that it was different from the Licchavi kingdom which Samudragupta had inherited from his mother. The Licchavi kingdom of Kumāradevī may be located in North Bihar with Vaiśālī (modern Basarh in Muzaffarpur district) as its centre.^198 It was a credit for the astute diplomacy of Candragupta to marry the Licchavi princess as we know, in ancient times, the Licchavis of Vaiśālī had been the rivals of the kings of Pāṭaliputra^199 and that they did not marry outside their area.^200 The name of this powerful people has come to us in many different readings: Licchavi, Lecchavi, Lecchai, Lecchaki, Licchvi, Nicchivi, Lichikki and Lichavi. Of these the Licchavi has been most commonly used in literature.^201 The earliest mention of this people is in Kauṭilya's Arthaśāstra,^202 where they are called Licchavis. Here we read that the corporations of Licchivi, Vṛji, Malla, Madra, Kakura, Kuru, Pañcāla and others were ‘rājaśabdopajīvinaḥ’. It is noteworthy that Kauṭilya distinguishes the Licchavis from the Vṛjis though some scholars consider them to be one.^203 H. Pandey^204 says that it appears from the Pali suttas that the names Vajji and Licchavi are interchangeable to some extent. But the accounts of Chinese pilgrims point to a different conclusion. Fa-Hien describes the kingdom of Vaiśālī where ‘Licchavis’ were the people of the country. He does not mention Vṛji or Vajji. Hiuen Tsang describes Vaiśālī and Vṛji as two distinct countries, and Watters is inclined to doubt the accuracy of his description of the Vṛji country.^205 But we know that Vajji was a powerful confederacy of which the Videhas along with the Licchavis, Jñātrikas, Ugras, Bhojas and others were the constituent confederate clans (aṭṭhakula). Of these the Licchavis and the Videhas were the most important, and the Licchavi Capital Vaiśālī was the head-quarter of the confederacy.^206 But Ray Chaudhuri observes: “Vajji was not only the name of the confederacy but also of one of the constituent clans. But the Vajjis like the Licchavis are sometimes associated with the city of Vaiśālī which was not only the capital of the Licchavi clan, but also the metropolis of the entire confederacy”.^207 The Licchavi republic was generally called the saṁgha or gaṇa of the Vajjis. The Licchavis would not possibly have allowed this name, had they not themselves been Vajjians. In one passage, the Licchavi Mahānāma, seeing that a band of young Licchavis who had been out hunting were gathered round the Buddha, is represented as saying, “They (i. e. the Licchavis) will become Vajjians, they will become Vajjians (bhavissanti Vajji bhavissanti Vajji)”! This possibly only means that there was great hope of these Licchavi young men becoming true Vajjians, practising the seven conditions of welfare taught by the Buddha, conditions which endured their prosperity, and leading a more cultured life. Thus the Vajji appears to be a more dignified term. It might have originally been given to the tribe which inhabited what is known as Vajjiraṭṭha (Vṛji-rāṣṭra), i. e., the Vajjian country, in Buddhist literature. Later a separation seems to have taken place among the Vajjis and Licchavis, because the Arthaśāstra (XI. I) mentions the Licchavika and the Vṛjika as two distinct republics.^208 The clan of the Licchavis figures very prominently in the annals of early Buddhism. Buddhaghoṣa, the celebrated Pali commentator has the following story^209: The chief queen of the king of Benaras, at the time of her child-birth delivered lump of flesh, ‘of the colour of lac and of bandhu and Jīvaka flowers’. Fearing the displeasure of the king if he should hear of this, the other queens put the lump of flesh into a casket marked with royal seal and placed it on the flowing waters of the Ganges. The casket was discovered by an ascetic, and taken by him to his hermitage, where he cared for the lump of flesh. After the lapse of some time, tha lump broke up into two pieces of flesh, which gradually assumed shape, till finally one of them became a boy resplendent like gold, and the other a girl. Whatever entered the stomach of these two infants looked as if put into a vessel of precious transparent stone (maṇi) so that they seemed to have no skin (Nicchavi). Others said: ‘the two were attached to each other by their skin (līna-chavi) as if they had been sewn together’; so that these infants came to be designated ‘Licchavis’. We are further told that on coming of age the boy and the girl were married to each other and from this brother and sister union sprang the race of the Licchavis^210 The origin of the Licchavis has been a matter of great controversy. They have been represented as Scythians, Kolarians, Tibetans and Persians by different authorities.^211 Samuel Beal^212 takes the Licchavis or Vajjis to be a branch of the ‘Yue-Chi’ forgetting that the latter came to India in the first century B.C. while the Licchavis were a highly civilized and prosperous people in the sixth century B.C. In the opinion of J.P. Hewitt, there are “very strong indications that the Vajjians, who were certainly the earliest settlers in the country, were of Kolarian race who had lived there long before the arrival of the Dravidians and Āryans”. The learned writer ignores the existence of the pre-Vajjian Āryan dynasty of rulers at Vaiśālī.^213 V.A. Smith^214 found similarities between the customs of the Tibetans and those of the Licchavis in the practice of the exposure of the dead and also in judicial procedure. And hence he came to the conclusion that the Licchavis, the ruling tribe or clan in Vṛji country of which Vaiśālī was the capital, was reallya Tibetan (or Mongolian) tribe which settled in the plains during the prehistoric times. The view has been criticised by B.C. Law, K.P. Jayaswal, H.C. Raychaudhuri and others on the following grounds^215: (1) The custom of the disposal of the dead was prevalent among the Vedic Āryans from whom the Licchavis were descended; (2) In the case of Tibet we have only three courts as against the seven tribunals of the Licchavis; further we know very little about the relative antiquity of the Tibetan procedure which might very well have been suggested by the system expounded in the Aṭṭhakathā. S.C. Vidyābhūṣaṇa^216 suggests a Persian origin for the Licchavis holding that the name Licchavi (Nicchavi of Manu, X. 22) was derived from the Persian city of Nisibis. There is very little in Vidyābhūṣaṇa's surmise except a fancied resemblance between the names Nicchivi and Nisibis. Inscriptions of the Achaemenids are silent about any Persian settlement in the Eastern India in the sixth or fifth century B.C. The Licchavi people were more interested in Yakṣa caityas and the teaching of Mahāvīra and the Buddha than in the deities and Prophets of Iran.^217 The Licchavis have been invariably represented as kṣatriyas in ancient Indian literature. As the Mahāparinibbāṇa-Sutta informs us, they claimed a share of the remnants of the Buddha's body on the ground that they were kṣatriyas like the Buddha himself: “The Exalted one was a kṣatriya and so are we. We are worthy to receive a portion of relies of the Exalted one”. We get many other similar instances.^218 We find that both the Śākyas (to whose race the Buddha belonged) and the Licchavis are described as progenies of brother and sister unions. Like the Śākyas, the Licchavis are also described as kṣatriyas.^219 Manu speaks of the Licchavis as kṣatriyas, though of the Vrātya variety.^220 Regarding the Vrātyas, Manu says: ‘Those (sons) whom the twice-born have by the wives of equal caste, but who, not fulfilling their scared duties, are excluded from the initiation to Sāvitrī, one must designate by the appellation vrātyas’.^221 We know that Mahāvīra, the founder of Jainism, was the very kin of the Licchavis and that he had many followers among the residents of Vaiśālī, even among the highest officers. Then again, between the sixth century B.C. and 200 B.C., the earliest estimated date of the Manusmṛti,^222 the Licchavis had won the good graces of the Buddha as well as of the followers of the religion he preached. During this long interval, when the two great ‘heretic’ faiths flourished in their country, the Licchavis might not have been particular to the ceremonies and practices that the regulations of the orthodox brāhmaṇas required. ‘Hence we can understand how Manu, the great brāhmaṇa law-giver came to refer to the Licchavis as Vrātyas’.^223 But Gokhale^224 takes the term kṣatriya in this context to mean representative of political power rather than a specific caste in the brahminical hierarchy and from the word Vrātya infers that they were outside the pale of the brahminical civilization. Scholars have divergent views about the connotation of the word ‘Vrātya’.^225 Charpentier described the Vrātyas, as a band of people not governed by the rules of caste, probably representing the worst elements of Indian society,<BR> -the thief, the robber, the drunken one, etc. But Keith rejected this view by pointing out that Manu's reference to the Rājanya Vrātyas, e. g. Licchavis and Mallas (X. 22) has no value for Vedic times.^226 Haver in his article ‘Der Vrātya’ derives ‘Vrātya’ from ‘vrata’. Thus the oldest meaning of ‘Vrāta’ is a group of people bound by holy ceremonies, bound by a vow to cultactions being derived from ‘vrata’ which is a vow taken in the service of a god. The Vrātīnas, on the other hand, ‘were Aryans of a more primitive culture and religion, than the orthodox brāhmaṇas, and were organised in cult-unions and both ‘vrātya’ and ‘vrātīna’ being derived from ‘vrata’ are ‘members of the same holy union’. The only difference between them apparently was that the Vrātīna went to the brāhmaṇa countries to perform the Vrātya-work and were paid for it, while the Vrātyas acted in their own homeland.^227 From all these considerations, we can see that the views of Manu and the suggestion of B.C. Law are more tenable. In the Nepāla Vaṁśāvalī, the Licchavis are allotted to the Sūryavaṁśa or solar race of the kṣatriyas.^228 This is quite in agreement with the fact elicited from the Buddhist records that they were Vāsiṣṭhas by Gotra, for we know from the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa^229 that the gotra or pravara (family) of a kṣatriya is the same as that of his purohita or family-priest. The Vasiṣṭha gotra was, therefore, the gotra of their family priest, and we know that the Vasiṣṭhas were the family priests of the kings of the solar race, especially of the Ikṣvākus.^230

11. Madrakas (No. I, L. 22): One of the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta. We also know of Madra as a personal name in No. 15, L. 8. Madras claimed descent from an eponymous king Madraka, son of Śibi Auśīnara, and were septs of the family of Śivi like the Kaikeyas.^231 According to Dr. Buddha Prakash ‘Bhadra’ was another Variant of Madra.^232 But this view is not acceptable to us. The Mahābhārata^233 mentions the Bhadras, but only in the Bombay recension; the Calcutta recension has Madra.^234 We know that Bhadra and Madra had independent existence, as found in the legend of Bhadrā Kākṣīvatī, bride of Vyuṣitāśva.^235 The queen had seven children, three Śālvas and four Madras. ^236 The Candravṛtti on Candra^237 informs us that Udumbara, Tilakhala, Madrakāra, Yugandhara, Bhuliṅga and Śaradaṇḍa, are the divisions of Sālva (or Śālva). The word Śālva literally means an animal like stag or gazelle which bespeaks of Scythian origin.^238 Buddha Prakash connects it with the modern sub-caste Saluja (Skt. Sālvaja). Anyhow, we know that Madras were a branch of Śālvas who were sons of Bhadra. J. Przyluski^239 considers the Madras to have been a section of the Bhadras on the ground that the former had among their ancestress a queen named Bhadrā. Both the Bhadras and the Madrakas are mentioned separately in the Bṛhatsaṁhitā,^240 the Bhadras with the Śālvas in the Madhyadeśa (Middle land) and the Madrakas with the Mālavas in the northern quarter. Nakula and Sahadeva were the sons of Pāṇḍu by his wife Mādrī. The name of their mother Mādrī suggests their connection with the clan of the Madras.^241 Since Bālhiki (Bāhlika stands for the Bactrians) was the title of Mādrī, Madras were of Irano-Bactrian origin; the Madras may represent the Iranian tribe, Māda or Mede.^242 The Madras were an ancient kṣatriya tribe.^243 We do not find their mention in the early Vedic Saṁhitās but the Vaṁśa Brāhmaṇa (of the Sāmaveda) tells us of a Vedic teacher named Madra-gāra Śauṅgāyani (‘descendant of Śuṅga’) whose pupil was Kāmboja Aupamanyava.^244 Zimmer^245 concludes, with probability, that these names point to a connexion of the Kambojas and the Madras. We know from the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa^246 that the Madra country was the chief centre of Vedic learning. We know of a Kāpya Patañcala amongst the Madras who was a famous teacher of Vedic lore.^247 The Uttara Madras, the ‘northern Madras’ are referred to in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa^248 as living beyond the Himalaya (pareṇa himavantam) in the neighbourhood of the Uttara Kurus, probably, as Zimmer^249 conjectures, in the land of Kashmira. The Madras mentioned in the Upaniṣads were, like the Kurus, probably settled somewhere in Kurukshetra in the Madhyadeśa or ‘Middle Land’.^250 Pāṇini^251 mentions two divisions of the Madras, Pūrva (eastern) and Apara (Western). In the Bṛhatsaṁhitā they are mentioned twice; firstly as Madra situated in West in Vāyavya Koṇa,^252 and secondly as Madraka with Mālava in the North.^253 In the Rāmāyaṇa, we read that Sugrīva sent monkeys to the Madrakas and other tribes in quest of Sītā.^254 The Madra tribe or kingdom^255 is mentioned in the Bhīṣmaparvan of the Mahābhārata (chap. IX) and in Pāṇini's grammar (II, 3, 73; IV, 4, 67). The Madras held the Central portions of the Punjab;^256 they appear in the Epic period to have occupied the district of Sialkot, between the rivers Chenab and Ravi,^257 or according to some between the Jhelum and the Ravi.^258 S.B. Chaudhuri^259 says that the Madras held the portion in the Doab between the Chenab and the Ravi, possibly comprising even a portion of the country between the Jhelum and the Chenab, and thus abutted on Kaikeya on the West. We get a clue to the inhabitance of the Madras from a verse in the Karṇaparvan of the Mahābhārata^260 which refers to a Madra, who had come to live among the Kurus, as yearning for his return to his native place beyond the Śatadru and the Irāvatī to enjoy the company of charming women. Śākala (Pali-Sagala, modern Sialkot) was the capital of the Madras identified^261 with Sanglawala-Tiba, to the West of the Ravi. From the Milinda-pañho, we learn that king Milinda (Menander) a Graeco-Bactrian king, who became a convert to Buddhism, was ruling over the Madda country with Sagala as his capital which according to a Buddhist lexicon, was one of the twenty ancient cities.^262 The brahminical name^263 of the Madra Capital was Śākala mentioned by Pāṇini^264 as Sānkala. In the Mahābhārata^265 and the Jātakas^266 Śākala is described as standing on the bank of the Āpagā in a tongue of land between two rivers, called the Śākaladvīpa, which corresponds to the Rechna Doab. We know from the Mahābhārata about Śalya, king of the Madras (Madrarāja). ^267 After severe fighting, and many vicissitudes, the Madra soldiers were killed by Arjuna.^268 The Madras are mentioned in the Purāṇas as well.^269 The Viṣṇu Purāṇa^270 refers to the Madras along with the Ārāmas, Pārasīkas, and others and in the Matsya Purāṇa^271 with Gāndhāra, Yavana and others. The latter^272 mentions king Aśvapati of Śākala in the kingdom of the Madras. The Madras, according to the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya^273 were a corporation of warriors and people enjoyed the title of rājan (rājaśabdopajīvinaḥ).^274 Madra women were noted for their beauty. ^275 The Jātakas bear ample testimony to the fact that the Madra princesses were sought in marriage by the great kṣatriya house of North India.^276 The Mahābhārata tells us that it was a family custom of the Madras to receive a fee from the bridegroom when they gave their daughters in marriage.^277 Some scholars identify the Madras with Vāhlika (or Vāhīka).^278 Śākala as a Vāhīkagrāma is also mentioned by Patañjali.^279 From the references in the Mahābhārata, Vāhīka would appear to have stood for the whole of Punjab.^280 The Vāhīka-grāmas of Śākala and Pātanaprastha, as referred to in the grammatical works,^281 imply the inclusion of Madrajanapada in the Vāhīka country. The Madras are known as low, barbarous^282 and sinful people.^283 They are mentioned as base, impure and contemptible.^284 “Amongst the Madrakas all acts of friendship are lost”^285 and so it is said: “Neither one should create enmity, nor friendship with a Madraka”.^286 The Rājataraṅgiṇī also records similar views.^287 But the advent of the Jarttikas or Jartas (modern Jāṭs) who spread over the whole of Punjab was responsible for the degeneration of the Madras.^288 The legend of Sāvitrī and Satyavan is connected with the Madra country, for Sāvitrī was the daughter of Aśvapati, king of Madra.^289 In the Udyogaparvan the camp of Śalya is described as full of warriors, whose strange armours, bows and banners, unfamiliar trappings, vehicles and equipment and local costumes, ornaments and deportment presented a unique spectacle in the country of the Kurus. ^290 In the early part of the sixth century A.D. the Madra country passed under the rule of the Hūṇa conqueror Mihirakula (A.D. 515-535) who ruled from Sialkot. The Madras continued to flourish even up to the time of the Pāla king Dharmapāla in the 9th century A.D.^291

12. Mālava (No. 1, L. 22; No. 17, L. 19; No. 32, L. 11): We know Mālava as a tribe which was subjugated along with some other tribes by Samudragupta (No. 1). No. 17 refers to the Mālava-gaṇa^292 which has been translated by Fleet as ‘the tribal constitution of the Mālavas’ in the sense of the event of some formal establishment of the Mālavas’ as a tribe.^293 Fleet fixes it up as 57-56 B.C.^294 Thomas^295 translates the expression as “the continuance (sthiti) of the tribal constitution (gaṇa) of the Mālavas” and adds “It was to gaṇa-sthiti, not to gaṇa, that I gave the meaning of ‘tribal constitution’; and I did not introduce the idea of ‘Continuance’.” My amended translation is “the usage of the Mālava tribe.”^296 Thus the expression ‘Mālavānām gaṇa’ refers to the Mālavas as a tribe. No. 32 speaks of the Mālava-vaṁśa which has been translated as ‘the race of the Mālavas,^297 but it would be better to translate it as “the dynasty of the Mālavas”.^298 It seems that this tribe had established independent rulership and so we find the word ‘vaṁśa’ used where the word ‘gaṇa’ could also be used^299 Dr. Buddha Prakash holds that Madras and Mālavas were the same, in Prakrit Madra becomes Malla, as ‘dra’ is changed into ‘ll’. He identifies Malla with the Malloi of the Greeks and Mālava of the Epic. He points out that the sons of Aśvapati, king of the Madras, were called Mālavas after their mother, according to decree of Yama which shows that Madra and Mālava were identical.^300 But we venture to disagree with the learned scholar. The Bṛhatsaṁhitā mentions Madraka and Mālava separately but side by side as people of the North.^301 At the time of Samudragupta, the Mālavas possibly lived in Rajasthan and West Malwa^302 consisting of Mewar, Tonk and adjoining regions of south-east Rajasthan.^303 They setteled in various localities in Western India after having migrated from the Punjab where they had fought with Alexander on the lower banks of Ravi.^304 Their original home was in Jhang District, Punjab. ^305 Subsequently they became the inhabitants of Malwa and the Vikrama era derived its original appellation from them.^306 That the Mālavas had migrated to the Jaipur region (Rajasthan) from the Punjab is supported by the fact that the legend on some Mālava coins found in Rajasthan reads from right to left as in Kharoṣṭhī, which was prevalent in the Punjab and the north-west from very early times.^307 The Sikhs of Ferozpur, Ludhiana, Patiala, Jind and Malerkotala are still known as Mālava Sikhs, probably, because these regions were populated by the Mālavas in ancient times.^308 Mālava and Mālavaka are also to be differentiated, the former is Mālava proper while the latter is lesser Mālava with the diminutive suffix ‘ka’.^309 Mālava is the same as Malloi of the Greeks.^310 Pāṇini does not mention them by name, but his sūtra, V. 3. 117 speaks of ‘āyudhajīvī saṁghas’, or tribes living by the profession of arms, and the Kāśikā says that amongst these saṁghas were the Mālavas and Kṣudrakas.^311 The Mālava tribe is actually mentioned in the Mahābhaṣya of Patañjali.^312 The Mahābhārata couples the Mālavas with the Trigarttas,^313 as well as with the Śivis and Ambaṣṭhas.^314 But soon they migrated southwards and settled somewhere in Rajasthan where we find them at the time of Samudragupta.^315 Many coins found at Nagar, 45 miles north of Kota, have the legend. “Mālavānām jayaḥ” (victory of the Mālavas) in letters belonging to the period from 250 B.C. to A.D. 250. According to Cunningham these coins show that the existence of the Mālavas as a recognised and important clan, long before their tribal constitution led to the establishment of their era.^316 The Mālavas came into conflict with Nahapāna's son-in-law Uṣavadāta who subdued them.^317 According to the Purāṇas^318 the Mālavas are associated with the Saurāṣṭras, Avantis, Ābhīras, Śūras, and Arbudas, dwell along the Pariyātra mountains. Thus they seem to have occupied other territories besides the Punjab or Rajasthan. Pargiter points out that even according to the Purāṇas the Mālavas lived in a ‘mountanious’ country, and were nowhere near present Malwa. Mālava king were taken as vrātya and mostly śūdra in the Purāṇas.^319 The Bhīṣmaparvan of the Mahābhārata mentions the western (pratīcya) and northern (udīcya) sections of the Mālavas.^320 But the Rāmāyaṇa locates the Mālavas in the east. ^321 Kāmasūtra's commentator Jayamaṅgala, who flourished later than the fourteenth century, says that Āvantika, which is identical with Ujjayinī-deśa, is apara-Mālava.^322 This has led some writers to suggest that Mālava proper is Daśārṇa. But Jayamaṅgala's geographical knowledge was not perfect.^323 His remark on Mālava is to be rejected as it runs counter to earlier authorities. Rājaśekhara mentions Mālava, Avanti and Vidiśā and the Mañjūśrī mentions Mālava, Vidiśā and Daśārṇa side by side^324 Modern Malwa is the region around Ujjayinī and Bhilsa. The influence of the Mālavas in the Mandasor region is proved by the fact that they could impose their tribal era upon the Mandasor princes.^325 An inscription describes the subjugation of Sapta-Mālava by Daṇḍanāyaka Anantapāla, a feudatory of Vikramāditya VI.^326 The Harṣacarita of Bāṇa refers to the ‘wicked Mālava king’ generally identified with Devagupta, who killed Grahavarman Maukhari, but was himself defeated by Rājyavardhana. B.C. Law places the kingdom of Devagupta between Prayāga and Bhilsa which is identical with Pūrva-Mālava.^327 Thus the Mālavas originally belonged to Jhang District in Punjab (now in Pakistan), from where they spread all over Punjab and by the time of Samudragupta had migrated to Rajasthan. The Mālavas had emerged in 250 B.C. as an independent tribal state. But they came under the subservience of the Śakas in the Ist century B.C., to the western kṣatraps from the 2nd to the 4th centuries A.D. and to Samudragupta in the 4th century A.D., but this typical native state exerted itself again.^328 In the period after about A.D. 550 they seem to have migrated further to the east and covered the region from Bhilsa (Eastern Malwa) to Prayāga.^329 During the rule of the Pālas of Bengal they seem to have migrated still further east; for the copper plates of the Pāla kings (excepting Dharmapāla), refer to the Mālavas as mercenary troops in their army.^330 The name of the tribe survives in the modern province of Malwa (a transformation of the word Mālava), and in the brāhmaṇa castes called ‘Mālavīs’ or ‘Mālavikas’. They are the brāhmaṇas of Mālava proper and the adjoining country, but are found also in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.^331

13. Mleccha (No. 14, L. 4): According to Sircar^332 Fleet conjectures the reading to be Mleccha. The last few letters in line 4 after ‘ni’ are not legible. So how Fleet could take this reading without putting any doubt is really surprising. Mlecchas were amongst the enemies defeated by Skandagupta in this inscription (No. 14). The war with the Mlecchas probably refers to his fight with the Hūṇas which is specifically referred to in the Bhitari Pillar Inscription. Whether the Mlecchas are the same as Hūṇas or were a different tribe, both the records (No. 13, No. 14) claim that Skandagupta completely defeated these enemies.^333 The fact that in both the inscriptions, the reference to the fight with the Hūṇas and Mlecchas is preceded by a reference to the falling fortunes of the family supports the identification. We also find a reference to the oppression of the earth by the Mlecchas in the epilogue of the play Mudrā-Rākṣasa written by Viṣākhadatta where it is prayed that ‘The earth may now be protected by “His Highness” along with relatives and retinue by king Candragupta’. It is probable that the play was written after the Rāmagupta episode and probably the word Mleccha in this context alludes to the Śakas who were suppressed by Candragupta II in the guise of the Gupta queen Dhruvasvāminī. D.C. Sircar^334 is of the view that Mleccha is the name applied to the Muhammadans and other foreigners. In the Sanskrit language originally there does not appear to have been any general term for a foreigner. But as the Dāsa, Dasyu, Barbara, and Mleccha became more or less absorbed in Āryan civilization and the original specific meaning of these terms was no longer remembered, these words came to be used for any foreigner.^335 The word Mleccha was used to refer to both the eastern and western Ānavas. In course of time it came to be used for almost any non-Āryan and even for Āryans of impure speech. Subsequently the term meant something like “foreigner”, but that was after most of the Ānavas had become assimilated.^336 When not used in association with the foreigners the word Mleccha is used for one who is impure, dirty or uncultured. It is derived from the root §mlich~mlech,^337 meaning to speak indistinctly (like a foreigner or barbarian who does not speak Sanskrit). We find the use of root in Mahābhāṣya.^338 The Sanskrit term Mleccha, referring to the indistinct speech of some non-Āryans, is taken from proto-Bodish (protoTibetan) mltśe “tongue”, Old Bodish ltśe, Kukish generally mlei, the combination of initial consonants (mltś<BR> -) being simplified in various ways in different Tibeto-Burmic languages. Aspiration cannot occur after I in old Bodish; and the protoBodish form may have been mltse for all we know, so the ‘cch’ of Sanskrit “Mleccha may come nearer the primitive affricate than anything preserved in the Tibeto-Burmic languages. Since ‘mleche’ would be an impossible combination in Sanskrit, mleccha would be as close as a Sanskrit speaker could come to it”.^339 Mleccha^340 occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa^341 in the sense of a barbarian in speech. Here the brāhmaṇas are forbidden to use barbarian speech. The example^342 given of such speech is “he' layo”, explained by Sāyaṇa as “he' rayaḥ”, “ho, foes”. The barbarians referred to were Āryan speakers, though not speakers of Sanskrit, but of a Prakrit form of speach.^343 An ancient tradition regards the Andhras, Pulindas and Śabaras as dog-eaters or Mlecchas.^344 The Jain Prajñāpanā records two divisions of the people of India<BR> -Milikkha and Ārya, and enumerates 53 people in the former group, some of which are the Saga, Javana, Sabara, Vavvara, Hoṇa, Romaya, Pārasa and Khasa.^345 The Mahābhārata^346 states that the Mlecchas dwelt in the Yavana, Cīna and Kamboja countries. In a dual between Karṇa and Śalya, Karṇa highly condemns the people of the Vāhīka and especially of the Madra Country and describes them as the Mleccha, the dirt among the human beings.^347 They belong to unpious countries and are totally ignorant about the Dharma (righteous conduct).^348 At another place, it is stated that the Yavanas are the Mlecchas, though they follow their own ways (i. e. not following the Vedic Orthodoxy) yet they are full of knowledge and brave but the Vāhīkas and the Madras are condemned as utterly foolish.^349 This makes it clear that the people not following the righteous conduct according to the Āryan beliefs, whether indigenous or foreign, were labelled as the Mlecchas. The Mahābhārata^350 shows that the coastal regions were the favourite resort of the Mlecchas and that they were dreadful. The Epic describes the Mlecchas as being impure because they were of bovine extraction and describes them as fierce and cruel.^351 In the Manu-Smṛti^352 the king is advised to exclude at deliberation time, the foolish, dumb, blind, and deaf, birds, the aged, women; the Mlecchas (the impure), diseased and deformed. At another place in the Manu-Smṛti where the girls bearing the names after a star, a tree, (or) a river, one called after the Antyas or a mountain, one called after a bird, snake, or slave or with a terrifying name are forbidden for marriage, Kullūka, the commentator on Manu explains the word Antya as representing the Mlecchas.^353 From the Manu^354 it is clear that the Mlecchas spoke a different language than the Āryans. The Vāyu, Matsya and Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇas state that the seven Himalayan rivers pass through the Mleccha countries.^355 In the Varāha Purāṇa, a place named Lohārgala is stated to be ruled over by the Mleccha kings.^356 The Amara-kośa^357 describes the Kirātas, Śabaras and Pulindas as the Mlecchajātis. The Bṛhat-Saṁhitā^358 places them in the West and describes them as unrighteous. It places them under the jurisdiction of Maṅgala graha^359 and assigns them the region of Rāhu graha, inhabiting the mountain-tops, low-regions or the caves.^360 In the ‘life’ of Hiuen Tsang, all places to the north of Lamgham district have been described as Mi-li-ku, i. e. frontier or Mleccha lands.^361 In the Ārya-mañjūśrī-Mūla-kalpa, the Mlecchas frequently appear as the companions of robbers.^362 In the KathāsaritSāgara,^363 the Mlecchas are connected with Sindh. They are stated to have killed brāhmaṇas, interfered with sacrifices, and carried off the daughters of hermits.^364 The Rājataraṅgiṇī^365 mentions the Mlecchas as issuing forth from the valleys adjoining the Himalayas. In medieval inscriptions, the name Mleccha has been applied indiscriminately to all foreigners.^366 The Mleccha army of the Gwalior Praśasti of Bhoja consisted of the Arabs.^367 The Mlecchas of the inscriptions of the medieval period refer to Muhammadans and the people of Baluchistan.^368 The Siddhānta-Kaumudī^369 describes the Kṣudhunas as the Mlecchas. In the Śaktisaṅgama Tantra (a work of the 17th century), we get reference to the Mleccha (verse 24), Mahāmleccha (verses 28, 30) and Mleccha-mārga (verse 31) where they are mentioned along with Pāñcāla, Kāmboja and Bāhlīka and the Khurāśan country is described as the Mleccha-mārga.^370

14. Muruṇḍas (No. 1, L. 23): Muruṇḍa is mentioned in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta along with the terms Daivaputra, Ṣāhi Ṣāhānuṣāhi and Śaka as one compound expression.^371 Fleet takes Śakas and Muruṇḍas as two separate tribes. They were one of the foreign potentates who came of their own accord to offer allegiance to Samudragupta. According to Sten Konow ‘muruṇḍa’ is the later form of a Śaka word meaning ‘lord’ or ‘master’. The term ‘ŚakaMuruṇḍa’ therefore possibly stands for those Śaka lords or chieftains who were ruling in the regions of Surāṣṭra and Ujjain at the time of Samudragupta.^372 But we find in the Khoh plates of Mahārāja Sarvanātha the names ‘Muruṇḍadevī’^373 and Muruṇḍasvāminī^374 which shows that Muruṇḍa was the name of a tribe and not a title. On the basis of Khoh plates, Smith^375 suggested that “the Muruṇḍas may possibly have been settled in the hill country of Riwa along the Kaimur range or more probably further south in the Vindhya or north Dekkan or possibly in the Chhotanagpur”. According to R.K. Mookerji,^376 the people called here as the Muruṇḍas are to be distinguished from the Śakas and may be identified with the Kuṣāṇas, as earlier suggested by Sten Konow.^377 We know that the term Daivaputra in the inscription has been used to refer to the Kuṣāṇa kings, and Śakas are mentioned separately. So we cannot equate Muruṇḍas with the Kuṣāṇas as suggested by R.K. Mookerji. Some scholars regard Muruṇḍa as the name of a powerful foreign tribe, ruling in the upper Ganges valley.^378 According to the Chinese authority, the Capital of Meou-lun (a word equated with Muruṇḍa) was 7,000 li from the mouth of the Great River, which was undoubtedly the Ganges. Allan is, therefore, not right in suggesting that the Chinese description of the capital refers to Pāṭaliputra.^379 Jayaswal took ŚakaMuruṇḍa to denote the smaller Śaka rulers like the ‘Shalada, Shaka and the Gadahara chiefs as well as the Western Satraps’.^380 In the Abhidhāna-Cintāmaṇi^381 and the Vaijayantī^382 the Lampākas are identified with Muruṇḍas. The Lampākas are the same as the Lambatai of Ptolemy.^383 The Purāṇas,^384 mention Lampākas, the people who were residing in Lampāka, the modern Laghman in Afghanistan. Rājaśekhara seems to be referring to Lampāka as Limpaka.^385 The Muruṇḍas seem to be a foreign tribe. Muruṇḍa is clearly a non-Āryan word and can have no Āryan derivation.^386 Ptolemy (2nd century A.D.) mentions the Muruṇḍas for the first time under the name Moroundai and places them on the western border of the ‘Gangaridai’. They seem to have occupied an extensive territory, probably the whole of North-Bihar on the east of the Gaṅgā, as far as the head of the delta. They had six important cities, all to the east of the Gaṅgā: Boraita, Koryagaza, Kondota, Kelydna, Aganegora and Talarga. These places are difficult to identify but to Saint-Martin Kelydna appeared to have some relation with Kālinadī or Kālindī river, and Aganagora with Aghadip (Agradvīpa) on the eastern bank of the Ganges, a little below Katwa.^387 According to Cunningham, the name of the Marundai is still preserved in the country of the Muṇḍas, a hill tribe scattered over Chhota-Nagpur and Central India.^388 But M.S. Pandey^389 opposes the view on the ground that the Muruṇḍas dwelt in the north-west with other foreign tribes. The evidence is strong enough to show that the Muruṇḍas had not spread so far to the east as to occupy the Chhota-Nagpur region. However, barbarous and pastoral the Muruṇḍas might have been before their immigration into India, when they held the sceptre in their hands they must have been endowed with the quality and capacity to rule over a people who were highly civilized. Such a race could hardly have sunk to a position so low as that of the Muṇḍas of the modern times. Moreover, the Muṇḍas are a dominant division of the aboriginals of the Chhota-Nagpur region. Had they been the descendants of the Muruṇḍas, we should have found them in other parts of Central India also, and not confined to this small region so far from their place of origin.^390 M.S. Pandey^391 disagrees with the Puranic account on the basis that many discrepancies have crept in owing to the mistakes of the copyists.

15. Prārjūnas (No. 1, L. 22): A tribe subdued by Samudragupta who are said to have obeyed his imperial commands and paid all kinds of taxes. Vincent Smith^392 places the Prārjūnas in the Narasiṁhapur district of the Central Provinces, but a more plausible location is Narasiṁhagarh in Central India,^393 as much as three other tribes which are coupled with Prārjūnas, the Sanakānīkas, Kākas and Kharaparikas, seem to have occupied regions more or less within the bounds of Central India^394 The tribe, associated with the name of Arjuna, existed in the Punjab and north-west before the advent of Gupta power in the fourth century A.D.^395 Kauṭilya knows of a people called Prājjunaka (Prārjunaka).^396

पुष्यमित्रस्
16. Puṣyamitras (No. 13, L. 11): The Bhitari Stone Pillar Inscription^397 records Skandagupta's victory over a powerful enemy called the Puṣyamitras, who possessed a strong army and a rich treasury: he (Skandagupta) placed (his) left foot on a foot-stool which was the king (of that tribe himself).^398 H.R. Divekar suggested the reading Yudhy-amitrān in place of Puṣyamitrān. But, as pointed out by R.D. Banerji,^399 the proposed reading is impossible. There are several views about the identification of the Puṣyamitras. (i) Fleet identified them with the people mentioned in the Purāṇas as Paṭumitras and located them on the Narmadā.^400 (ii) V.A. Smith^401 regarded them as a people of the North. (iii) Hoernle believed that they were the same as the Maitrakas.^402 (iv) R.D. Banerji^403 regarded them as the first wave of the Hūṇas. (v) N.K. Bhattasali has suggested that the Puṣyamitras were the descendants of king Puṣyavarmā of Assam.^404 Bhattasali says that a pun (śleṣa) has been used for “the descendants of Puṣyavarman of Assam who had so long been mitras or friends of the Guptas, but had change into foes by their desire for conquest and had invaded the Gupta empire from the east and made it totter”. But as remarked by D.C. Sircar, “there is no grammatical, lexicographical, or literary support, for this interpretation of the name Puṣyamitra”.^405 Bhattasali opines that Mahendravarman, whom he assigns to the period A.D. 450 to 490 who performed two horse-sacrifices must have been powerful enough to launch an attack on the Gupta empire in the reign of Skandagupta. We know that the definite limits of Skandagupta's reign are from A.D. 455 to 467. The period of the rule of Mahendravarman, however, cannot be so definitely fixed because we do not possess any dated records of his reign. As a matter of fact the entire chronology of the kings of Assam can be settled approximately only by means of synchronisms and rough calculations. The attack on the Gupta empire by the Varmans of Assam in the reign of Skandagupta is an impossibility.^406 The Puṣyamitras cannot be a branch of the Hūṇas as held by R.D. Banerji. The Hūṇas have been mentioned separately in the Bhitari Inscription.^407 “By whose (Skandagupta's) two arms the earth was shaken, when he, the creator (of a disturbance like that) of a terrible whirlpool, joined in close conflict with the Hūṇas”. Hoernle's view that “the Puṣyamitras were the same as Maitrakas who some years later under the leadership of Bhaṭārka established themselves in Valabhī probably with the help of the Hūṇa ruler Toramāṇa”;^408 is also not acceptable as the Maitrakas remained subservient to the Imperial Guptas from the time of Bhaṭārka to that of Droṇasiṁha.^409 Therefore, they cannot be the same as Puṣyamitras who rebelled against Skandagupta. The Purāṇas mention a people called Puṣyamitras, whose rule commenced after the end of the dynasty of the Vindhyakas. In the Viṣṇupurāṇa MSS. consulted by Prof. Wilson we have the following statement: “and Puṣpamitras, and Paṭumitras and others to the number of thirteen will rule over Mekalā”.^410 Prof. Wilson has added the following note, “It seems most correct to separate the thirteen sons or families of the Vindhya princes from these Bāhlikas and then from the Puṣyamitras and Paṭumitras who governed Mekalā, a country on the Narmadā”.^411 A similar statement is to be found in the Vāyupurāṇa, according to which ‘the Puṣyamitras and Paṭumitras are grouped with the rulers of Mekalā, whose seven kings have not been named.^412 The mention of Vindhyakas, evidently a people of the Vindhya region, and of Mekalā, points to the south rather than to North. So the view of V.A. Smith that the Puṣyamitras were a people of the North is not acceptable. Thus the view of Fleet that the Puṣyamitras are to be placed in Central India somewhere in the country along the banks of the Narmadā, seems to be most reasonable.^413 This is supported by numismatic evidence, a hoard of coins brought to light by D.B. Diskalkar,^414 from the village of Bamnala, 24 miles to the south of the Narmadā, indicates that there was a serious disturbance of peace in the vicinity of Mekalā, in the middle of the fifth century A.D. and we may connect it with the rising of the Puṣyamitras in that region.^415

साहानुषाहि
17. Sāhānuṣāhi^416 (No. 1, L. 23): Ṣāhānuṣāhis are also mentioned to have paid homage to Samudragupta along with other tribes. The Ṣāhānuṣāhis are to be identified with the Sassanids or the Sassanian kings. The title ‘Sāhānuṣāhi (śahān-śāh) has frequently been used by the Sassanian kings.^417 The contemporary Sassanian emperor was Shahpur II (A.D. 309-379).^418 The Sassanians are known to have been the rulers of Persia from A.D. 211 to 651.^419 According to tradition the dynasty is named after its founder Sassan. His son and successor Papaka, seized power by a coup d'etat against his suzerain, the Parthian king and his accession was the starting point for a new cra (A.D. 208).^420 Goyal^421 confuses the Sassanians with the Pārasīkas of Kālidāsa. But they were different from the Pārasīkas. The Sassanians had founded a powerful kingdom in Persia, but they had not yet conquered the whole of Persia.^422 The Pārasīkas of Kālidāsa were the Ṣāhis.^423 Though the possibility of a Kuṣāṇa-Sassanian coalition may not be ruled out it seems that at the time of Samudragupta,^424 three kings the Daivaputra (the Kuṣāṇas), the Ṣāhi (the Persians or the Pārasīkas of Kālidāsa), and the Ṣāhānuṣāhi (the Sassanians) were ruling independently.^425 Buddha Prakash^426 traces the Khatri sub-castes Sahni and Osahan as the remnants of the title ‘Ṣāhānuṣāhi’. But this is far-fetched. So far as Sahni is concerned it is to be connected with Sādhanika the name of an officer in the administration of the early medieval period.^427 It may be noted that the Sassanian title Śahan-Śāh was used for the Great Emperor in Mughal period, which usage continues. In popular parlance the term is used for calling or receiving some person respectively.

षाहि
18. Ṣāhi^428 (No. 1, L. 23): The Ṣāhis are said to have paid homage to Samudragupta. From the appendix it is clear that Daivaputra is not an adjective of Ṣāhi as Goyal^429 has surmised and has identified it with Kidāra Kuṣāṇa of the Great Kuṣāṇa family. Daivaputras have been interpreted to denote the Kuṣāṇas; so Ṣāhis cannot be identified with the Kuṣāṇas. They must have been an independent and separate tribe, and may be identified with the Persians mentioned in the Raghuvaṁśa in connexion with the North-Westren conquests of Raghu.^430 Goyal^431 identifies the Sassanians with the Pārasīkas of Kālidāsa. But Pārasīkas can never be identified with Sassanians. The word ‘Pārasīkas’ itself clearly be speaks of the Persians and is identical with the modern Parasis. Moreover, Ṣāhānuṣāhis are to be identified with the Sassanians whereas Ṣāhis refer to the Persians. Even now the king of Persia (Iran) is known as ‘Shāh of Iran’. Ṣāhi is an Iranian or Persian word and seems to have some relation with Sanskrit root §śās to rule, which when formed a noun means ‘a ruler’. ^432 The Śāhi dynasty of Kabul was ousted by the brāhmaṇa minister of the last king. The new dynasty was also known as the Śāhis and has been mentioned by Al-Beruni and Kalhaṇa. The word Śāha or Sāhu, often used for banias in villages, is not connected with Ṣāhi or Śāhi but is to be derived from Sanskrit ‘sādhu’.^433

19. Saiṁhalaka (No. 1, L. 23): Inhabitants of Siṁhala or Ceylon. They are mentioned along with the Daivaputras, Ṣāhis, Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas and Muruṇḍas, and all (other) dwellers in islands (probably the islands of Southern Sea such as Jāvā and Sumātrā)^434 who paid homage to Samudragupta by offering themselves for services, bringing presents of maidens, praying for charters bearing the imperial Gupta Garuḍa seal (Garutmadaṅka) by which they would be left undisturbed by the emperor in the enjoyment (bhukti) and administration (śāsana) of their respective territories.^435 If literally interpreted the inscription will suggest that the people mentioned here were really tributaries under Samudragupta. When we see from the inscription itself that the Tamil states were left undisturbed, the inclusion of even distant Siṁhala (Ceylon) and all other islands in this category raises great doubts about this interpretation, and we shall hardly be justified in taking the words of the Court-poet in their literal sense without corroborative evidence.^436 But the question arises that was the conquest of Tāmraparṇī (Siṁhala) by Aśoka in his Rock Edict II also a simple boast of this kind?^437 So far as Ceylon is concerned, we have fortunately an independent evidence of its political relation with Samudagupta. We know that after the death of king Mahāsena (A.D. 334<BR> -62) of the Lambakarṇa clan his son Sumeghavarṇa (chi-mi-kiapo-mo = “cloud of merit”) became king of Ceylon who was a contemporary of Samudragupta (San-meou-to-lo-kin-to).^438 He, according to a Chinese text, sent two monks to Bodh-Gayā to visit the sacred spots, but they were put to great inconvenience for want of suitable accommodation. To remove this difficulty for future pilgrims to the holy place, Meghavarṇa decided to found a monastery there. He accordingly sent a mission to Samudragupta with rich presents and asked for permission, and the Ceylonese king built a splendid monastery to the north of the Bodhi tree.^439 By the time of Hiuen Tsang it had developed into a magnificant establishment, with more than 1,000 priests, and the pilgrim has described the rich decorations and massive grandeur of the buildings. Referring to the old history of its foundation Hiuen Tsang says that the Ceylonese king ‘gave in tribute to the king of India all the jewels of his country’. “It is likely that Samudragupta's courtier also regarded the rich presents as a tribute, and construed the Ceylonese king's prayer for permission to build a monastery into an ‘application for charter confirming him in the enjoyment of his territories’, one of the forms of homage paid by the category of states into which Siṁhala is included”.^440 Siṁhala is generally identified with Laṅkā. But Varāhamihira^441 mentions both of them separately as situated in the South. Laṅkā has been identified differently by various scholars with Laṅkā of Madhyadeśa,^442 with Maldives,^443 with the northern part of the Andhra country on the shores of the Bay of Bengal,^444 and with an island off the south-east Coast of Ceylon.^445 All these theories are refuted by S.B. Chaudhuri^446 who remarks that the assumption that Laṅkā is not Ceylon is gratuitous.^447 He points out that in the Rāmāyaṇa Rāvaṇa while entreating Sītā to be his wife says: “Laṅkānāma samudrasya madhye mama mahāpurī sāgareṇa parikṣiptā niviṣṭā... ”^448 Hanuman makes a similar statement in describing the strategical position of Laṅkā: Sthitā pāre samudrasya dūrapārasya.^449 Kālidāsa in his Raghuvaṁśa in connexion with ‘Purīm Laṅkām’ writes: “Mahārṇava parikṣepam lankāyāḥ parikhālaghum”.^450 With regard to the bridge built by Rāma Kālidāsa notes: sa setuṁ bandhayāmāsa plavaṅgairlavaṇāmbhasi.^451 In the Skanda Purāṇa^452 and in the Kathāsaritsāgara, we have similar references to Laṇkā.^453 All these passages point distinctly to the great sea on the other side of which was situated the great city of Laṅkā. The separate mention of Siṁhala and Laṅkā in many Sanskrit texts is quoted to show that Laṅkā was distinct from Ceylon.^454 This is hardly convincing for the separate mention of Mathurā and Śūrasena, Sāketa and Kosala, Gāndhāra and Takṣaśilā, Avanti and Ujjainī, did not imply any material geographical difference as they were treated only as convertible terms in geographical texts of the Purāṇas. In the Puranic lists, Laṇkā is a territorial name and Siṁhala is an ethnic name. As the name of a city in the island of Siṁhala, Laṅkā passed off as a dvīpa, and the two names were used in the same geographical sense. A passage in the Rāmāyaṅa runs thus: “Siṁhalān barbarān mlecchān ye ca laṅkānivāsinaḥ”.^455 Hiuen Tsang also mentions Seng-ka-lo (Ceylon) which included Leugka (Laṅkā).^456 As pointed out by B.C. Law, the Mahāvaṁśa and its commentary show that Laṅkādvīpa (the lower portion) was one of the main divisions of the island of Ceylon.^457 It is a valid presumption, therefore, that the ancient name Laṅkā referred to Ceylon.^458 We may assume further, as seems very likely, that Laṅkā was the early name of Ceylon and its literary name as well. Mention is made of Laṅkādvīpa even in medieval inscriptions.^459 The Madras museum plates of Jaṭilavarman refer to the beautiful island of Laṅkā as Ilangai.^460 Epigraphic evidence, however, shows that Siṁhala, another name of ancient Ceylon, was equally well known. Thus the Kanhad plate of Kṛṣṇa III refers to the island of Siṁhala.^461 In another inscription the king of Siṁhala is described as waiting on the shore.^462 In other inscriptions Siṁhala is variously designated as Siṅgala-deśam,^463 Sīlam^464 and Sihala.^465 All this evidence favours the suggestion that as territorial names Siṁhala and Laṅkā were convertible terms, although the latter is also used as the name of a city. Priaulx remarks and probably, correctly, that Laṅkā was the old mythological name for Ceylon, and that later on it was supplanted by Tāmraparṇī, and subsequently when the Periplus was written, by Palaesimundus or Palaesimoundon which itself was transformed into Salike, Sereṇdiva derived from Pali Sihala or Sihala dīpa.^466 The name Palaesimoundon is very plausibly based on “pāre samudrasya”,^467 in the description given of Laṅkā as noted above. Ptolemy's Simoundon^468 also refers to that name. But in Ptolemy's Geography the island is called Salike which responds to Siele diba of Kosmas Indicopleustes^469 both of which have their sources in Sihalam “the Pāli form of Sanskrit Siṁhala” or Ceylon. To this source may be traced its other names such as Serendib, Zeilan, Sialan,^470 the last one yielding to Ceylon. Marco Polo's Seilan^471 is a nearer approach to the modern name. Van-der-turk suggests that the name may have been derived from Sela or ‘precious stone’, hence the island was anciently called Ratnadvīpa.^472 An Arab historian called it the “Island of Rubies”. The Chinese name for the island also implies reference to gems. The name Sailān also occurs in the works of Rashiduddin, Hayton and Jordanus.^473 Al-Beruni called it Singaldīb.^474 Siṁhala is perhaps so called as once abounding in lions.^475 We may note here that there are references to another Siṁhala quite different from Ceylon.^476 It was placed to the east of Marudeśa and to the south of the Kāmādri. It is evidently in the Punjab-Rajasthan region and reminds us of the kingdom of Siṁhapura mentioned by Hiuen Tsang.

20. Śaka (No. 1, L. 23): One of the tribes which is said to have paid homage to Samudragupta. As we have already discussed in connexion with the Muruṇḍas, the expression, ‘Śaka-Muruṇḍa’ should not be translated to mean Śaka-lords. Following Fleet^477 we may better split the expression into two distinct names, the Śakas and Muruṇḍas. The Śakas in the time of Samudragupta (4th century A.D.) must be the Śakas of Western India belonging to the Satrapal family of Caṣṭana and Rudradāman. In this period the Śaka ruler was Rudrasiṁha II and his successor Rudrasiṁha III, whose coins come up to A.D. 390, was killed by Candragupta II.^478 Other persons of that nationality were ruling in and about Sāñcī.^479 The Scyths, whom Indians named as Śakas, were originally living on the borders of Bactria. A nomadic people called Yueh-Chih by the Chinese forced them to move from that place. Eventually in the beginning of the first century B.C., the Śakas moved on from Bactria to attack first the Parthians of Iran, and then the Greeks in India.^480 By the middle of the Ist Century B.C. there remained only a few petty Greek chiefs in India, and the power of the Śakas reached Mathurā. The Śakas continued the earlier practice of issuing coins with bilingual legends in Greek and Prakrit. The earliest Śaka king in India was Maues (about C. 80 B.C.)^481 Towards the close of the first Century A.D., the Sātavāhanas were pushed out from the North-West Deccan by the invading Śakas of the Kṣaharāta clan; but the Śatavāhanas under the greatest of their rulers, Gautamīputra Śātakarṇin recovered their lands about A.D. 130. After this event nothing more is heard of the Kṣaharātas.^482 Another Śaka dynasty, called the Kārddamaka family but generally known as the “Western Satraps”, gained control of Kathiawar and Malwa at about the same time, and ruled roughly upto A.D. 400, and at the hight of their power governing much of Rajasthan and Sind also. The greatest ruler of this dynasty was Rudradāman, who has left the earliest important inscription in correct Sanskrit,^483 a long panegyric which records his martial exploits, and his reconstruction of a great artificial lake at Girnar in Kathiawar, which had been excavated under Candragupta and improved in the time of Aśoka. This inscription is among the earliest certainly dated records of ancient India, and proves that Rudradāman was reigning in A.D. 150.^484 Samudragupta's main effort was in the direction of the West, where the Śakas had ruled for over 200 years and which was enriched by the lucrative western trade. The Śakas at that time controlled Malwa and Kathiawar and were a power to be reckoned with. ‘Though the Allahabad Pillar Inscription claims that Samudragupta received homage from “the Śaka lords”, it is probable that he did not measure swords with them’.^485 It is clear that the Śaka homage to Samudragupta was not at all sincere and reliable since it was not tendered to his successor,^486 and Candragupta II had to conquer the Śakas once again. There is indeed a tradition that on the death of Samudragupta the Śakas succeeded in shaking the Gupta Empire, and forced the weak king, Rāmagupta, to conclude a dishonourable peace.^487 Most authorities reject the story, and deny the historicity of Rāmagupta, but the recent discovery of copper coins bearing his name^488 strengthens the suggestion that the tradition has a basis of fact.^489 It was Candragupta II (C. 376-415), the son of Samudragupta and younger brother of the shadowy Rāmagupta, who finally defeated the Śakas, soon after A.D. 388^490 So he is rightly remembered as ‘Śakāri’ ‘the enemy of the Śakas’.^491 The trousers were introduced into India by the Śakas and seem to have been in vogue among the ruling classes during the Gupta times, for Gupta kings often appear on their coins as wearing trousers.^492 The Śakas were notorious drinkers. It is said that Cyrus defeated the Śakas, when they were maddened by wine.^493 It has been suggested by Buddha Prakash that as a result of the influence of the Śakas, the vogue for excessive drinking spread. Strabo^494 speaks of a Bacchanalian festival of the Persian, in which men and women, dressed in Scythian style passed day and night in drinking and wanton play.^495 We know of similar drinking bouts in the Mahābhārata.^496 Probably the Scythians and the Iranians popularised drinking in the Punjab. The people of the Gangetic country, sticking to pristine ideals of moderation did not relish the exotic drink ing bouts popularised in the Punjab, under Śaka and Persian influence. Baudhāyana in his Dharmasūtra, Karṇa in the Mahābhārata, and the Buddha in his discourses denounced drinking and laid down a prohibition against it.^497 But all this is not agreeable since Buddha and Baudhāyana belong to a period before the coming of the Śakas. Āryans have been great lovers of drinking. We can find sufficient evidence for the drinking before Śakas. We may here refer to the Śaka Era (A.D. 78), which is very popular in India even to-day. Traditionally this era is known to have been founded by a Śaka king who occupied Ujjayinī 137 years after Vikramāditya. The era may in fact have been founded by Kaniṣka. It was certainly used early in the 2nd Centuary A.D. by the “Western Satraps”, who ruled Malwa, Kathiawar and Gujarat. Thence, the use of the era spread through the Deccan and was exported to South-East Asia.^498 Because of its long association with the Śaka Satraps the era may have earned its present name. The Śakas came to be included in the category of the martial classes of ancient India. Manu^499 refers to the warlike people on the fringes of Āryan civilization, including the Greeks (Yavana), the Scyths (Śaka), and the Parthians (Pahlava), as kṣatriyas who had fallen from grace through their neglect of the sacred law, but who could be received once more into Āryan fold by adopting the orthodox way of life and performing appropriate penitential sacrifices.^500 The Śakas were a white-skinned tribe or race of people; in the legends which relate the contests between Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, the Śakas are fabled to have been produced by the cow of Vasiṣṭha, from her sweat, for the destruction of Viśvāmitra's army.^501 Buddha Prakash^502 traces the Śaka invasion on the basis of literary and linguistic considerations. The name of the capital of the Madras, Śākala, and that of the region between the Ravi and the Chenab, Śākaladvīpa, are based on the word Śaka and are indicative of a Śaka invasion. Likewise, the name of the clan Śākya, to which Buddha belonged, enshrines a reminiscene of the word Śaka. Moreover, the place-names ending in kanthā existing in the whole of the Punjab from the Bannu valley to the Kankhala region and even beyond suggest an intrusion of the Śakas long before the time of Pāṇini,^503 who is known to have flourished one century before the invasion of Alexander, the Great. Kanthā is a Śaka word for city^504 and is akin to kadhāvara or kanthāvara of Kharoṣṭhī inscriptions, Kand of Persian, Kanthā of Khotanese, Kandh of Sogdian, Kandai of Pushto, Kanda or Koent of the dialect of the Ṛṣikas. It is significant that the land beyond the Oxus, the Urheimat of the Śakas, abounds in Kanthā-ending place names, such as Samarkand, Khokand, Chimkand, Tashkand, Panjkand, and Yarkand. The reference to the stepped-well, called Śakandhu after the Śakas, together with that worked by Persian Wheel, known as Karkandhu after the Karkians, in a vārttika of Katyāyana^505 also leads to the same conclusion. At the time of Alexander's invasion the Śakas lived at the north-western borders of India. That this tide of Śaka invasion, descending from the north-west, touched the eastern extremity of India, is manifest from the traditions of the Purāṇas that the Śakas advanced to Ayodhyā during the reign of King Bāhu and that his son Sagara checked and repelled them.^506 In the Mahābhārata the Śakas are stated to have constituted along with Cūlikas, Tuṣāras and Yavanas, the right wing of the Krauñcavyūha formed by Bhīṣma on the sixth day of the battle. ^507 Caraka in his medical treatise^508 refers to them in the context of Central Asiatic tribes, viz. Bāhlika, Pahlava, Cīna, Yavana and Śaka.^509 Buddha Prakash also tries to trace the remnants of the Śakas in modern times.^510 The Śakas came into Punjab after the Yavanas or the Greeks. During their long rule they contributed a great deal to Indian culture and ultimately became one with the Indian people.^511 The depth of their influence on Indian society is manifest from the word thakura, which implies the ideas of nobility and divinity and stands for the Rajputs in the Punjab and is derived from the word thagora, taugara or tukhara.^512 The name Tukhāra itself survives in the name of the Tokhi caste found in the North-West.^513 Another caste called Khosla is a survival of Kusulaka, the surname of the Kṣaharāta chiefs Liaka Kusulaka and his son Patika Kusuluka. Analogous to this word is the name of Kuzula Kadphises the first Kuṣāṇa emperor to advance towards the Punjab. Hultzsch has equated this word with Turki güjlü meaning ‘strong’, and Sten Konow has compared it with Turki guzel, meaning ‘beautiful’, but Lüders has shown that it is the name of a family or clan of the Śakas.^514 So the name of Khosla is a remnant of this tribe.^515 Besides the Thakuras and Tokhis of the Punjab, there are caste-groups of Soi and Sikka, which are reminiscent of the Śakas.

सनकानीक
21. Sanakānīka (No. 1, L. 22; No. 3, L. 2): In Inscription No. 3 it occurs with the short ‘i’ in the fourth syllable, i. e. as ‘Sanakānika’.^516 The Sanakānīkas were also subjugated by Samudragupta along with other tribes who payed him all kinds of taxes, obeyed his orders and were coming to perform obeisance.^517 In the Udayagiri Cave Inscription of Candragupta II, of the Year 82 (A.D. 401) (No. 3), we know of a Mahārāja of the ‘Sanakānīka’ tribe or family, who was a feudatory of Candragupta II and who is stated to have recorded his gift on a Vaiṣṇava Cave temple at Udayagiri.^518 Udayagiri is a well-known hill about two miles to the north-west of Bhilsa, ancient Vidiśā.^519 Thus we can say that the Sanakānīkas lived in the neighbourhood of Bhilsa.^520 D.R. Bhandarkar mentions them to have held the province of Vidiśā but he also locates Gaṇapatināga's kingdom (one of the kings subjugated by Samudragupta) in Vidiśā.^521 So his view seems to be inconsistent. It may be noted that the Sanakānīka feudatory chief of Candragupta II, as well as his father and grandfather, bore the title Mahārāja. This may suggest that the Sanakānīkas, and probably other tribes mentioned along with them in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription were not tribal republics, as is generally supposed, but were ruled by hereditary chiefs.^522 The name of the grandfather of this Sanakānīka feudatory chief of Candragupta II, is given as Chagalaga ‘which looks like a foreign name’;^523 but his father bears a purely Hindu name: ‘Viṣṇudāsa’. Of course the present chief's name is illegible in the inscription (No. 3).^524 But considering the trend it may be surmised that his name also was a Sanskrit name.^525 It seems that the tribe which originally consisted of aboriginal people was gradually coming under the influence of Sanskrit culture.

वाह्लिक
22. Vāhlika (No. 20, L. 2): The Meharaulī Pillar Inscription (No. 20) describes the digvijaya of a king named Candra (i. e. Candragupta II) in the first verse as stated below: “He, on whose arm fame was inscribed by the sword, when, in battle in the Vaṅga countries, he kneaded (and turned) back with (his) breast the enemies who, uniting together, came against him;<BR> -he, by whom, having crossed in warfare the seven mouths of the (river) Sindhu, the Vāhlikas were conquered;<BR> -he, by the breezes of whose prowess the Southern ocean is even still perfumed”.^526 We find various readings of the name Vāhlika in literature which are: Vāhlika, Bāhlika, Vāhlīka and Bāhlīka. In our inscription (No. 20) ‘Vāhlikāḥ’, i. e. Vāhlika in plural denotes the people of Vāhlika i. e. Bactria (modern Balkh) region on the Oxus in the northern part of Afghanistan.^527 Mislead by a verse in the Rāmāyaṇa,^528 D.R. Bhandarkar^529 places Vāhlikas in the close proximity of the Vipāśā, the modern Beas. The reading Vāhlīkān in the passage quoted from the Rāmāyaṇa is a mistake for Vāhīkān. Numerous passages can be quoted from the Epic, Puranic and classical Sanskrit literature to prove that the Punjab = Pañcanada, ‘the land of five rivers’, was in ancient times called the Vāhīka country.^530 ‘Vāhīka’ was, in fact, a general term for the whole of Punjab. We know Śākala as Vāhīka-grāma from Patañjali and also Pātanaprastha which is modern Pathankot by the same term. Moreover, Vatsyāyana in his Kāmasūtra and Rajaśekhara in his Kāvya-mīmāṁsā mention the people of Bāhlīka and Punjab as two separate entities. ^531 There is, however, one verse in the Karṇaparvan of the Mahābhārata which suggests that Vāhīka was originally the name of a country or people on the Vipāśā, (the Beas): “In the Vipāśā, there were two Piśācas named Vahi and Hika; their descendants are called Vāhīkas who are not the creation of Prajāpati”.^532 Later on the sense of the word expanded to cover all the tribes living in the Punjab. It is interesting to note that the Māhābhārata sometimes uses the terms Vāhīka, Madra, Jartika, Āraṭṭa and Pañcanada synonymously. It appears that the lands of these tribes which lived close to one another became in course of time moulded into a big kingdom under the powerful kings of Śākala (Sialkot). As Vāhīka was beyond Kurukshetra and, therefore, outside the boundary of Brahmāvarta, its analogical connection with the word ‘bahis’ may have been another cause of the expansion of its geographical sense.^533 This is also reflected in the Vārttikas of Katyāyana who derives the word ‘Vāhīka’ from ‘vahis’ or ‘bahis’, meaning ‘outside’ (the pale of Āryandom).^534 Some scholars^535 rely on the description of the Bāhlikas as the offspring of two Piśācas, Bahi and Hika, as given in the Mahābhārata. Buddha Prakash holds that fresh stream of the Bactrian people which swooped over the Punjab came to be known as Bālhikas; their name which became a general designation for the people of Punjab was later corrupted as Vāhīka.^536 But we have already shown that the two were separate entities. We know that the Vāhīkas were the people living within the boundaries of the five rivers including the sixth Sindhu (Indus),^537 but according to the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription Candragupta conquered Vāhlikas after crossing the seven months of the (river) Indus (sapta mukhāni sindhoḥ).^538 So Vāhlika of our inscription is certainly Balkh in the extreme north of Afghanistan.^539 Bajpai^540 opposes it on the ground that Candragupta could not have gone to so far off a place as Bactria which is situated across the Hindukush and rejects the older contention of scholars that the Kuṣāṇas were ruling in Bactria during king Candra's campaign and that he crossed the Hindukush to crush them. But the view of Bajpai is not tenable since it is clear from the lines in our inscription^541 that king Candra had conquered the Vāhlikas after crossing the seven mouths of the river Indus. So far as the literary evidence is concerned we find that Bālhika is the name of a people in the Atharvaveda;^542 here the fever (Takman) is called upon to go to the Mūjavants, the Mahāvṛṣas, and the Balhikas. The Mūjavants are quite certainly a northern tribe, and though the passage may contain a pun on Bālhika as suggesting ‘outsider’ (from bahis, ‘without’),^543 still there is no doubt that the name was chosen from a northern tribe.^544 The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇā^545 mentions a Kuru king named Balhika Prātipīya. It seems that Balhika was a descendant of Pratīpa. But there is no evidence to show why he bore the name Balhika.^546 He is perhaps the same as Mahārāja Bāhlika Prātīpeya of the Mahābhārata.^547 The Rāmāyaṇa shows that the Royal Kuru family originally migrated from the Bāhlīka country. The passage in question^548 says that Ila, son of the Prajāpati Kardama, who was the king of the Vāhli country, gave up Bahlika in favour of his son Śaśavindu, and founded a new city Pratiṣṭhānapura in the Madhya-deśa, where his other son Pururava Aila continued to rule. This links up the Ailas, the progenitor of the Kurus, with the Kardama royal family of Bāhli. H.C. Raychaudhuri^549 suggests that Kārddama, the name of the ruling family of Vāhlika, was obtained from the river of that name in Persia, and thus infers that the home of the Kārddama king is to be identified with Bahlika or Balkh in Iran. This view was earlier advocated by Roth^550 and Weber.^551 But Zimmer^552 rightly shows that there is no need to assume any Iranian influence.^553 We know Vāhlīka from the Puranic list of peoples^554 The Account of fifty-six countries^555 is interesting as it mentions them with the Hūṇas, Kauravas, Gāndhāras and Vidarbhas among others. In the Śaktisaṅgama Tantra^556 Bāhlīka is described as famous for horses and situated to the east of Mahāmlechha and beginning with Kamboja. B.C. Law on the basis of reference in the Mahābhārata^557 places the Vāhlikas in the neighbourhood of Gandhar and Kamboja.^558 Katyāyana (4th century B.C.)^559 mentions Bāhlāyana and derives it from the word Bāhli, a country also mentioned in the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya.^560 The Vāyu Purāṇa, Śiva Purāṇā, Kāvya-Mīmāṁsā of Rājaśekhara and the Rāmāyaṇa^561 place the Vāhlika country in the northern division.^562 Bāhlika is the name of a person in the Viṣṇu-Purāṇa.^563 The Nāṭyaśāstra^564 of Bharata says that Bāhlikabhāṣā was spoken by the northern people (Udīcyas). A similar reference is also to be found in the Sāhitya-darpaṇa.^565 In the Kāmasūtra of Vatsyāyana,^566 Bāhlīka is grouped with Strīrājya, which occurs in the list of North-Western division. The peculiar custom in Bāhlika of several young men being married to a single woman as in strīrājya (strīrājye ca Bāhlike...), appears to be an outlandish custom prevaiting in the regions to the west of India.^567 The Jayamaṅgalā commentary also says that Bāhlīka was in Uttarāpatha.^568 We find the word Vāhlika occurring in the Amara-kośa in two ways:

बाह्लिक
1. Bāhlika^569

बाह्लीक
2. Bāhlīka^570 The Amarakośa shows that Bāhlīka was famous for horses, saffron and Ferula Asafoetida (hiṅgu). The reference to saffron leads us to the filaments of saffron on the banks of Vaṅkṣu (oxus) where Raghu gave defeat to the Hūṇas as described in Kālidāsa's Raghuvaṁśa.^571 The reading Sindhu of the passage^572 is plainly a mistake for Vaṅkśu which is corroborated by Kṣīrasvāmin, the earliest commentator of Amara who clearly shows that the Bāhlīka country was bordered on the Oxus.^573 The Bṛhatsaṁhitā^574 places Bāhlīkas in the jurisdiction of the Sun. Ancient tradition connects the Bāhlikas with the Dhārṣṭakas, a Kṣatriya clan which occupied the Bāhlīka country.^575 We know that Bāhlīkī was another name of Mādrī, queen of the Madras.^576 Buddha Prakash suggests that the Vedic school of the Bhāllavins enshrined the memory of the Bāhlīkas; the modern sub-castes of the Barasarin sub-group of the khatris Bhalla and Behl represent the ancient Bālhīkas, and the Jāṭ clans of Bhālār and Bhalerah, found in Multan, the Baloch tribe Bhalkā, living in Sindh, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan and the clan Bhallowana, found in Shahpur, are remnants of the far-flung Bāhlika tribes.^577 There is a possibility of the Bāhlīkas migrating from their original home Balkh to the Punjab.^578 When Hieun Tsang visited Balkh, it was a centre of Buddh ist faith,^579 but after the overthrow of the Sassanid kingdom by the Arabs, the ancient Bactria along with the adjoining territories passed under the control of Khorasan, the seat of the Muhammadan power.^580

यौधेय
23. Yaudheya (No. 1, L. 22): The Yaudheyas are included among the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta. In his time, they seem to have occupied northern Rajputana and south-east Punjab, and their territory extended up to the confines of the Bahawalpur State where their name survives in the name of the tract called Johiyawar.^581 Their earliest reference in the inscriptions is found in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradāman I (A.D. 150)^582 which mentions the victory of Mahākṣatrapa Rudradāman over the Yaudheyas who were ‘proud of their heroism’. The Bijayagadh Inscription^583 which is a record of the Yaudheyas (in Brāhmī characters of the second-third century A.D.)^584 connects them with Bharatpur State in Rajputana. It refers to one Mahārāja Mahāsenāpati, the ruler of the Yaudheya-gaṇa.^585 Literally the word Yaudheya means ‘a warrior’ which corresponds with the Ossadü of Arrian, the Sambastae of Diodorus and the Sambracae of Curtius, who made their submission to Alexander.^586 They were a powerful nation and their forces consisted of 60,000 foot, 6000 horse, and 500 chariots.^587 We get three different versions about the origin of the Yaudheyas: (i) In the Mahābhārata^588 it is stated that Yudhiṣṭhira married the daughter of the Śaivya King Govāsana named Devikā and begot a son from her named Yaudheya. Buddha Prakash^589 and M.K. Sharan,^590 on this basis, have been tempted to connect the Yaudheyas with Yudhiṣṭhira, the eldest of the Pāṇḍava brothers. D.K. Gupta questions the foundations of this theory on this solitary basis in the absence of a more solid or a positive evidence;^591 but on the other hand he himself has indulged in connecting the Ārjunāyanas with the epic hero Arjuna.^592 (ii) The Viṣṇu-Purāṇa gives a contrary view of the same story. It states that Yaudheyī was the queen of Yudhiṣṭhira from whom he had a son named Devaka^593 (iii) The Harivaṁśa^594 and the Vāyu Purāṇa^595 state that King Uśīnara of the Puru dynasty had five queens named Nṛgā or Mṛgā, Kṛmī, Navā, Darvā and Dṛṣadvatī who gave birth to five sons named Nṛga, (or Mṛga), Kṛmi, Nava, Suvrata and Śibi (or Śivi) respectively. Śibi was the lord of the Śibi people or of the city of Śivapura, while Nṛga (or Mṛga) was the ruler of the Yodheyas or of Yaudheyapura. The other three sons of Uśīnara, viz., Nava, Kṛmi and Suvrata, were the lords respectively of Navarāṣṭra, Kṛmilāpurī and Ambaṣṭhapurī.^596 According to Pargiter, King Uśinara established the Yaudheyas, Ambaṣṭhas, Navarāṣṭra, and the city of Kṛmilā, all on the eastern border of the Punjab; while his famous son Śivi Auśīnara originated the Śivis or Śrbis in Sivapura.^597 It is very difficult to reject or accept the Puranic tradition without any further evidence. However, as regards their connection with Uśīnara, we may say that scholars are somewhat confused by differing versions by varied text with regard to the territory ruled over by him.^598 The Ṛgveda, the Jātakas as well as the accounts of Fahien and Hiuen Tsang connect the Uśīnaras with a region farther to the north-west in Swat Valley, a part of the ancient Mahājanapada of Gandhāra; while the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, the Kauśītakī Upaniṣad and the Kathāsaritsāgara associate them to the region north of Haridwar near the source of Ganges at Kanakhala. It is possible that originally they were settled in the Swat Valley but by the passage of time, they migrated to other places as well. For example, we find that the Śibis were known to Alexander's followers, living between the Indus and the Akesines (Chenab).^599 In the Mahābhārata,^600 the Yaudheyas are described as having been defeated by Arjuna, along with the Mālavas and Trigarttas. In the Sabhāparvan,^601 the Yaudheyas together with the Śibis and the Trigarttas are represented as having paid homage to Yudhiṣṭhira. In the Droṇaparvan,^602 we find that an epithet ‘Adrija’ meaning ‘mountain-born’, is used for the Yaudheyas. The Yaudheyas were one of the republican tribes of the Punjab. Pāṇini^603 includes them among the āyudhajīvī saṁghas together with the Parśus who are considered to be Persians by Dr. Buddha Prakash.^604 Pāṇini mentions the Yaudheyas in another Sūtra also.^605 Kauṭilya also refers to the Yaudheya as a warrior clan of the Punjab.^606 The Bṛhatsaṁhitā^607 places them in the northern division of India and describes them as being in the region of Bṛhaspati.^608 In the Sāhityadarpaṇa of Viśvanātha, they are described as interested in gambling (dīvyatām) and speaking the Southern Vaidarbhī.^609 Yaudheya coins have been found all over the area from Saharanpur to Multan. In the Ludhiana district have been unearthed their votive tablets. A rich find of their coin-moulds was brought to light by B. Sahni at Khokrakot near Rohtak where there seems to have existed a regular mint.^610 Their new currency^611 depicting their tutelary deity Kārttikeya which replaced the Kuṣāṇa currency in these regions, shows that they played a leading part in the extermination of Śaka rule in India.^612 The findings of the Yaudheya coins in large number at Saharanpur, Dehradoon, Delhi, Rohtak and Kangra attest the fact that they had driven out the Kuṣāṇas from these areas and had re-established themselves firmly, in the 3rd-4th century A.D.^613 One of their seals, bearing the legend “Yaudheyānām jayamantradharāṇām”^614 shows that they were held in high esteem among the warrior-clans of the Punjab. Some scholars seem to be confused about its interpretation. Shobha Mukerji^615 opines that their coins were issued in the name of the gaṇa as well as the Mantra-dharas. M.K. Sharan^616 explains the word “Mantradhara” to mean the members of the Executive Committee “those vested with the policy of the state”. He is of the opinion that one set of the Yaudheya coins is struck in the name of the “Mantradharas” and the “Gaṇa”, while the other set is struck simply in the name of Gaṇa.^617 He seems to have wrongly substituted the reading “Mantradhāra” for “Mantradhara”. He has been arbitrary in separating “Jaya” from Mantradharāṇām”^618 which forms a compound by the combination of the two words. Further he rejects the view of some historians who consider the word “Mantradharāṇām” to mean ‘those who were in possession of Victory Charm’. But he contradicts himself at another place while explaining a seal^619 found at Naurangabad with the remarks: “This seal indicates the bravery of the tribe and that they were never defeated as they had adopted the title of ‘जयमन्त्रधराः’”. Actually the expression may mean ‘the Yaudheyas who knew the secret of victory’. It is symbolic of their victory and pride that they never got defeated. Another word which has raised some controversy among the scholars is “Darma” found on some of the Yaudheya coins. Some scholars take it to mean Dharma while others take it for ‘Dama’ or ‘Darma’ to be a Sanskritised form of Greek<BR> -“Drachma”.^620 Again some controversy arose whether it was a Copper one or of silver.^621 The word ‘Damma’ or ‘Dramma’ has been used for a gold coin.^622 It may be remarked that the word borrowed from some foreign language may not strictly be used in the original sense and hence it may simply mean coin.^623 The Kuṣāṇas had introduced gold-coins which were later on adopted by the Guptas. But the Yaudheyas seem to have never adopted the gold currency since so far we have found no gold coin belonging to them. This may speak of their weaker economic condition; surely they could not compare with powerful monarchies. On some of the Yaudheya coins, we have the mysterious words, “dvi” (two) and “tri” (three) after the legend “Yaudheyagaṇasya jayaḥ” which may point out their making a confederation with other tribes, viz., the Ārjunāyanas and the Kuṇindas.^624 They seem to have controlled the area lying on the banks of the river Sutlej up to the borders of the Bahawalpur State which is still called Johiyawar. The word ‘Johiya’ is apparently an abbreviation of ‘Jodhiya’, which is the Sanskrit Yaudheya.^625 Cunningham, however, takes the words ‘dvi’ and ‘tri’ of the above-mentioned coins to signify ‘the money of the second and third tribes of the Yaudheyas’.^626 M.K. Sharan^627 has enlisted about twenty-four types and Symbols on the coins of the Yaudheyas which may point to their religious leanings as well bear out some aspects of their social life. They are as follows: 1. Bull 2. Elephant 3. Deer 4. Peacock 5. Tree-in-railing 6. Human figure standing (warrior) 7. Lakṣmī 8. Cobra 9. Scythic-like object (Yūpa) 10. Stūpa 11. Triśūla 12. Nandipada 13. Shell 14. Svastika 15. Vase or Maṅgala Kalaśa 16. Tribal sign or Ujjayinī Symbol 17. Two ‘s’ with a line in between probably representing two hooded snakes 18. Triangular-headed symbol or more probably a Yūpa 19. Zig-Zag line depicting snake or river 20. Circles with dots around, probably representing the sun 21. Curved object within railing, probably a representation of the Yūpa 22. Hill so-called Caitya 23. Six-headed Ṣaṣṭhī or Kṛttikā^628 24. Śiva. 

राष्ट्र
Rāṣṭra^1 (from §rāj): It is the oldest and biggest territorial term. In the Ṛgveda^2 and later Saṁhitās,^3 it denotes ‘kingdom’ or ‘royal territory’. It is considered to be one of the Prakṛtis (constituents)^4 and refers to a country.^5 It was the name of a Commissioner's division under the Rāṣṭrakūṭas.^6 In South India, under the Pallavas, Kadambas, and Sālaṅkāyanas also it denotes only a district, if not a tehsil.^7 The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra^8 says that ‘all the rāṣṭra including nagara is called deśa or maṇḍala while nagara is excluded in janapada’. It divides rāṣṭras into three kinds:<BR> -(i) Big: It consists of nine thousand and ninety villages, but some scholars say that the nine thousand and sixty four villages make a big rāṣṭra.^9 (ii) Middle: It consists of five thousand, three hundred and eighty four villages.^10 (iii) Small: It consists of one thousand, five hundred and forty eight villages.^11 It further discusses that seven cities should be established in each rāṣṭra.^12 In place-names rāṣṭra is changed into:^13 (a) Rāṭhā, as Mahārāṣṭra, Marāṭhā (b) Rāṭ, at Mayarāṣṭra, (= Mayarāṭ), Mirāṭ It also changes into raṭṭa, Cf. Nāgiraṭṭa. Walde also derives it from §rāj-(n. sg. rāṭ) Sk. rāṣṭra: AV. rāstar<BR> -,^14 In ancient Indian history extending over several centuries, we do not find uniformity in the nomenclature of the different territorial and administrative divisions in the various kingdoms flourishing in different centuries and provinces. In the small kingdoms like those of the Pallavas, the Vākāṭakas and Gāhaḍavālas we usually find reference to only one territorial division, the district variously called viṣaya or rāṣṭra.^15 Following are the names with this ending:

देवराष्ट्र
1. Devarāṣṭra (No. 1, L. 20): It has been mentioned as ruled by Kubera one of the kings ruling in Southern Region who were subdued by Samudragupta. Dey^16 identifies it with the Maratha country (i. e. Mahārāṣṭra). Fleet and Smith are also of the same opinion. G. Ramdas slightly differs from them when he identifies Devarāṣṭra with modern Devagiri in the Dharwar district.^17 According to R.D. Banerjee^18 Devarāṣṭra is the name of a district or province in Kaliṅga. B.C. Law^19 identifies it with Yellowmanchili taluka of the Vizagapatam district, which is also the view of H.C. Raychaudhuri,^20 S.B. Chaudhuri,^21 Dubreuil and Bhandarkar.^22 This view is generally accepted at present. Earlier scholars held that Samudragupta made a round of the South crossing from the eastern to the western coast of India. But this involves serious difficulties about his potential relations with the Vākāṭakas. Now, scholars describe southern campaign of Samudragupta as confined to the eastern coast. Thus it becomes apparent that Devarāṣṭra was conterminous with Kośala (Sirpur). Tāmralipti may have been included in Devarāṣṭra.^23 2. Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa (No 28, L. 2, L. 8, L. 15): L. 2 of the inscription mentions a maṇḍala (sub-division) called Nāgiraṭṭa (Nāgiraṭṭa-māṇḍalika) and later on refers to MūlaNāgiraṭṭa which seems to have been the headquarters of this maṇḍala. It is clear from the inscription itself that MūlaNāgiraṭṭa was situated in the neighbourhood of Nitva-Gohālī.^24 Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa literally means ‘Nāgiraṭṭa Proper’. The word Nāgiraṭṭa is the Prakritic form of Nāgarāṣṭra meaning ‘a country of the Nāgas’.

सुराष्ट्र
3. Surāṣṭra (No. 14, L. 8, L. 9): In L. 8 Surāṣṭra is used in plural^25 while in L. 9 it is an adjective of avani (land).^26 In this inscription great importance has been attached to Surāṣṭra. After his conquests, Skandagupta deliberated for days and nights together as to whom should be entrusted important task of guarding the land of the Surāṣṭras.^27 At last he was satisfied by appointing Parṇadatta as a governor over this western^28 region. Surāṣṭra corresponds with Southern Kathiawar with its Prakrit name Soraṭh.^29 Literally the name means a good country. It was so named probably on account of the natural fertility of the land, Soraṭh is well known for rich crops of all kinds, and splendid cattle.^30 Surāṣṭra^31 is mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradāman I (A.D. 150). It was governed by Puṣyagupta, under Candragupta Maurya and by a Yavana Tuṣāspa under Aśoka.^32 The Purāṇas^33 and the Kāvyamīmāṁsā^34 mention it a country in the west while the Bṛhatsaṁhitā^35 mentions it as a country in the South. It may be due to the different geographical units made by the authors of the Kāvyamīmāṁsā and the Bṛhatsaṁhitā. Under Gupta emperors Bāmanasthalī (modern Banthali) was the capital of Surāṣṭra, before Valabhī became its capital.^36 The name Surāṣṭra also occurs in the Mahābhārata, the Jātakas^37, and several times in the Rāmāyaṇa.^38 It is also mentioned in Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya.^39 In Kauṭilya's Arthaśāstra, Surāṣṭras are mentioned as one of the corporations of warriors who lived by agriculture and trade.^40 According to the Arthaśāstra the elephants of Surāṣṭra were inferior to those belonging to Aṅga and Kaliṅga.^41 In the medieval period,^42 in three directions, Bhavanagar, Porabandar and Somanath (the famous temple) were the limits of Surāṣṭra. Place-names ending in Bhukti

भुक्ति
Bhukti (from §bhuj) Literally it means ‘enjoyment’ or possession.^43 Bhukti denoted an administrative division smaller than a modern Tehsil or Taluka in the Deccan and M.P., but in Northern India under the Guptas and Pratihāras it denoted a unit as large as the Commissioner's Division in modern times.^44 Thus Pratiṣṭhānabhukti consisted of only 12 and Koppārakabhukti of 50 villages in the Deccan under the Rāṣṭrakūṭas,^45 whereas under the Guptas the Puṇḍravardhanabhukti comprised of the districts of Dinajpur, Bogra and Rajshahi, and Magadhabhukti included the districts of Gayā and Pāṭaliputra.^46 Śrāvastibhukti under the Pratihāras included several districts in northern U.P.^47 The Bhuktis under the Pratihāra empire appear to have been rather Commissioners' Divisions than provinces.^48 Bhukti is changed into huti as Jejakabhukti, Jejahuti.^49 The unit bhukti which so often appears in the inscriptions of the Gupta period as the designation of an administrative unit is not frequently found in the early medieval period.^50 The mention of a Nagara-bhukti is also made in Deo-Baranark Inscription of Jīvitagupta II.^51 We find only one place name with the suffix bhukti which is detailed below: Puṇḍravardhana (No. 28, L. 1; No. 33, LL. 1-2; No. 34, L. 2; No. 35, L. 2; No. 36, L. 2; No. 37, L. 2; No. 43, L. 14): This bhukti is mentioned in the Gupta epigraphs ranging from the years 124 to 224 of the Gupta era, i. e. from A.D. 443 to 543. It formed an integral part of Gupta empire during this period. According to Inscription No. 37, a noble man (kulaputra) Amṛtadeva by name belonging to Ayodhyā approached the local government of Koṭivarṣa of which Svyambhudeva was the governor, under the provincial government of Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti, during the reign of Bhānugupta, and prayed that he might be given, by means of a copper-plate document in accordance with the prevailing custom, some rent-free waste lands. His prayer was granted. General Cunningham^52 identifies Puṇḍravardhana with the extensive ruins known as ‘Mahāsthāngarh’, 8 miles north of the town of Bogra. The river Karatoyā was the dividing line between Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti and Kāmarūpa.^53 According to Wilson, the ancient kingdom of Puṇḍradeśa included the districts of Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Malda, Bogra and Tirhut.^54 It seems to have been the biggest administrative division or province of the Gupta empire, divided into several viṣayas and maṇḍalas of which twenty-four^55 are mentioned in known epigraphs. In short Puṇḍravardhana signified North Bengal. Puṇḍravardhana, as the name suggests, was a settlement of the Puṇḍras.^56 The first reference to the Puṇḍras is found in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.^57 The earliest literary reference to Puṇḍravardhana is to be traced in the Buddhist work, the Divyāvadāna, where it is mentioned as the easternmost city of India.^58 The Pauṇḍra country is mentioned also in the Bṛhatsaṁhitā,^59 as situated in the east.^60 The Kāvyamīṁāṁsā also mentions it as a Janapada in the east. In the inscriptions of Bengal the name Puṇḍravardhana was changed into Pauṇḍravardhana in the early part of the 12th century, when it occurs first in the Manahali grant of Madanapāla and remained in use till the end of the Sena rule. The Rājataraṅgiṇī mentions Puṇḍravardhana as the capital of Gauḍa which is also proved by a reference in Puruṣottama's lexicon (11th century A.D.)^61 The city lost its importance from the third quarter of the 12th century A.D. as the later Sena kings shifted their capital to Gauḍa in the Malda district. Towards the end of the 13th or the beginning of the 14th century A.D. Puṇḍravardhana was occupied by the Muhammedans.^62 Place-names ending in Viṣaya

विषय
Viṣaya According to Monier Williams it means a dominion, kingdom, territory, region, district, country, or abode and in plural it meant lands or possessions.^63 In the Aṣṭādhyāyī^64 it denotes regions or provinces, called after their inhabitants, e. g. Śaiba, the region of the Śibis; Mālavaka, the region of the Mālava people; Rājanyaka, of the Rājanya tribe and so forth. ‘The names according to Viṣaya seem to be based on the ethnic distribution of population over particular areas for the time being without reference to the form of government’.^65 The word Viṣaya in the sūtra Viṣayo deśe^66 is significant. Jainendra, Śākaṭāyana and Hemacandra take it as rāṣṭra, and Vardhamāna as Janapada. The Kāśikā takes it as grāma-samudāya. Kātayāyana and Patañjali interpret Viṣaya as being identical with janapada in some cases, but their comments give the impression that even such geographical units as were not a janapada were called Viṣaya.^67 If Viṣaya and Janapada had been identical, Pāṇini would not have treated the former under a separate heading.^68 A Viṣaya denoted both a bigger unit having the status of a Janapada, and a smaller area which was but an estate. In the Rājanyādi gaṇa, viṣaya denotes janapadas, while in the Bhauriki and Aiṣukāri gaṇas,^69 it is landed property, the share of estate which was the source of livelihood. In the post-pāṇinian period, distinction between Janapada and viṣaya was lost, both being called by the same names, for example Aṅgāḥ, Vangāḥ, Sumhāḥ, and Puṇḍrāḥ. In some Janapadas like Rājanya, the distinction was retained, as Rājanyaka denoted a viṣaya and Rājanyāḥ, the Janapada of the Rājanya tribe. Similarly we have Vāsātaḥ, Vāsātayaḥ; Gandhāraḥ, Gāndhārayaḥ; and Śaibaḥ, Śibiyaḥ. Other smaller units were only viṣayas or estates like Bailvavanaka, Ātmakāmeyaka, Bhaurikavidha and Aiṣukāri-bhakta.^70 The viṣaya usually corresponded with the district of the modern administration.^71 Minor bhuktis, maṇḍalas and the viṣayas were used to denote the same administrative division in many cases.^72 The district administration was well organised in the Gupta period. Some of the land-grant charters bear the seals of the district administration.^73 Sealings of the district administration of Rājagṛha and Gayā have been found at Nālandā, showing that their correspondence to outsiders bore the impress of their official seals.^74 We have the following place-names ending in Viṣaya:

गया
1. Gayā (No. 21, L. 7): A village named Revatikā belonging to the Gayā viṣaya was granted as an agrahāra to a brāhmaṇa, ostensibly by Samudragupta.^75 Gayā is at present headquarters of the Gayā district, 60 miles due south of Patna. It comprises the modern town of Sahebganj on the northern side and the ancient town of Gayā on the southern side.^76 Much has been written on Gayā,^77 all of which is not possible to discuss here. We will confine ourselves to the origin of the name Gayā and the importance of Gayā. In the Ṛgveda Gaya is a proper name applied to a composer of hymns.^78 In the Atharvaveda^79 Gaya appears to be a wonder-worder or sorcerer along with Asita and Kaśyapa who later on transformed himself into Gayāsura.^80 According to the Vāyu Purāṇa,^81 the city was named Gaya after an Asura, Gaya by name (Gayāsura). Viṣṇu killed this demon but granted him a boon that this city would be held highly sacred. According to R.L. Mitra,^82 this story is an allegorical representation of the expulsion of Buddhism from Gayā which was the headquarters of the Buddhist faith. Aurṇavābha in explaining ‘idam Viṣṇur-vī Cakrame tredhā nidadhe padam’^83 in the Nirukta^84 holds that the three steps of Viṣṇu were placed on Samārohaṇa, Viṣṇupada and Gayaśiras. The Māhabhārata (III. 95 and VII. 64) describes the performance of sacrifices by Gaya^85 references to which^86 are also found in the Rāmāyaṇa,^87 Bhāgavata Purāṇa^88 Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,^89 Agni Purāṇa,^90 Viṣṇu Purāṇa,^91 Vāmana Purāṇa,^92 etc. Aśvaghoṣa's Buddhacarita^93 (I or II cent. A.D.) speaks of the Buddha's visit to the hermitage called ‘the city of the royal sage Gaya’, who was later conceived as a great giant.^94 We can find evidence of the importance of Gayā growing in the period subsequent to A.D. 750. At Gayā while we have only one inscription belonging to the Gupta period, we get numerous inscriptions belonging to the Pāla period.^95 But these records are of not much use for the history of the town, they simply show that till the end of the twelfth century A.D. it was under the Pālas.^96 The city played no major role in polities at any period of history but it was certainly a centre of religious movements of Buddhist and the Brahmanical Hindus.^97 Gayā which was the headquarters of Buddhist faith passed to the Hindus between the second and fourth centuries of the Christian era and by A.D. 637 when Hiuen Tsang visited the city it had become a thriving centre of Hindu Brahmanical religion.^98 The religious importance of Gayā is met with in the Māhābhārata,^99 Rāmāyaṇa^100 and Purāṇas.^101 The Gayā has a special religious importance with reference to the Śrāddha ceremony.^102

खाद्पार
2. Khād(ṭā)pāra^103 (No. 29, L. 7): The inscription came from a place Dhanaidaha in the Natore subdivision of the Rajashahi district (in Puṇḍravardhana).^104 So this viṣaya may be assigned to the Puṇḍravardhana bhukti. The name of the district cannot be read with certainty. Sen^105 suggests three readings: Mahā-Khushāpāra, Khādā(ṭā) pāra, or Khusaspāra. Banerji gives the reading ‘Mahā-khuṣāpāra.^106

कोटिवर्ष
3. Koṭivarṣa (No. 34, L. 3; No. 35, L. 3; No. 36, L. 3; No. 37, L. 3): It has been described as a viṣaya under Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti. This reference clearly shows that the size of a viṣaya was smaller than that of a bhukti. The viṣaya of Koṭivarṣa occurs frequently in the epigraphic records of the Pālas and Senas.^107 It seems to have comprised the southern part of the Dinajpur district, the northern portion of Rajashahi and probably also the eastern tracts of the Bogra district.^108 Its head-quarters was Diw-kot (Devakoṭa or Devīkoṭa).^109 Yādavaprakāśa identifies Koṭivarṣa with Devīkoṭṭa.^110 The Vāyu Purāṇa also refers to a city of the name of Koṭivarṣa.^111 The Prakrit lexicon Pāia-sadda-mahaṇṇavo describes it as the capital of Lāṭa country.^112 The name is known to the Jain Prajñāpanā in which it is placed in Lāḍha or Lāṭa.^113 Hemacandra^114 says that Koṭivarṣa, Bāṇapura, Devīkoṭa, Umāvana and Śoṇitapura are identical. Puruṣottama^115 agrees with Hemacandra with the only difference that he mentions Uṣāvana in place of Umāvana. Bāṇapura is represented by Bāngarh in the Dinajpur district, which still preserves the extensive ruins of a citadel known as Damdamaḥ said to have been the fort of Devīkoṭa associated with the exploits of the mythical king Bāṇa.^116 Diw-koṭa or Devīkoṭa (wrongly read as Dihikota in the A-In-i-Akbarī) was a mahal under the Sarkar of Lakhnautī (Lakṣaṇavatī).^117 The termination varṣa is significant. It denotes a division of the earth as separated off by mountain ranges.^118 From the Purāṇas we know of such names as Harivarṣa, KiṁpuruṣaVarṣa and Bhārata-Varṣa.^119 Varṣam in Pāṇini^120 means the rainy season. We know that rains are connected with the mountains. So originally the divisions might have been made according to the rains in different areas. Rains being very important for agriculture affect the inhabitants of a certain area throughout the year. Later on the semantic development of the word came to denote a year. In India the seasons have been regarded to be important and hence they had often been used to denote the year.^121

कृमिला
4. Kṛmilā (No. 40, L. 5): The Viṣaya or district of Kṛmilā also spelt as Krimilā is mentioned in inscription No. 40. According to D.C. Sircar “as the charter is spurious and seems to have been forged a few centuries after Samudragupta's time, it may or may not prove the existence of a viṣaya and therefore of a city of the above name in the fourth century.^122 But certain old seals found at Nālandā prove the existence of Kṛmilā before the Pāla occupation of Bihar.^123 The village Kavāla in the Krimilāviṣaya known from one such seal can be identified with modern Kawāli not far from Valgūdar.^124 The viṣaya or district of Kṛmilā is also mentioned in the records of the Pālas of Bengal and Bihar.^125 According to a tradition recorded in the Harivaṁśa,^126 Vayu Purāṇa^127 and the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa^128 Kṛmi, the son of king Uśīnara of the Puru dynasty, born of his second queen Kṛmi, was the lord of Kṛmilāpurī.^129 In the Buddhist literature, we get various forms for the city of Kṛmilā: Kimilā, Kimmilā and Kimbilā. The name of an inhabitant of the city is given as Kimila, Kimmilā or Kimbilā. Malālasekera^130 recognises the spellings Kimilā or Kimbilā and Kimila or Kimbila, but prefers the forms Kimbilā and Kimbilā. Kimilā can be the Pali form of Sanskrit Kṛmilā (or Krimilā), and Kimmilā can be derived from the other Sanskrit variant Kirmilā.^131 Two Suttas, the Kimilāsutta and Kimilasutta, were preached by the Buddha when he was camping at the city of Kimilā (Kṛmilā) said to have been situated on the bank of the Gaṅgā. The river is now at a short distance from the villages of Valgūdar and Rajauna, on the site of which the ancient city stood.^132 M.S. Pandey^133 opposes the identification of Kṛmilā with Valgūdar on the ground that there is not sufficient evidence to prove this identification. Though Kṛmilā is not referred to in early Pali literature, we find a city named Kṛmilā mentioned in the Aṅguttara Nikāya Commentary.^134 According to this commentary, the city stood on the bank of the Gaṅgā. But now-a-days, the Gaṅgā flows at some distance from this region which may be due to a change in the course of the river during so many centuries. The city was not very important and may have gradually disappeared. At present we do not find any traces of the city: it may have been washed away by the Gaṅgā. According to Pandey^135 the name of the modern village Kiul has some resemblance with the name Kṛmilā and it is not unlikely that the city may have been somewhere in that locality. Sircar is himself not sure about the identification of Kṛmilā with Valgūdar^136 and seems to prefer the claim of modern Kawali not being far from Valgūdar Kṛmilā.^137 But in the district Gazetteer of Monghyr it is the village of Kiul which is mentioned and not Kawali. Hence we prefer the view of Dr. Pandey. The word Kṛmilā means “a fruitful woman” or “a place full of worms” and the word Kṛmi forming its first part is sometimes also written as Krimi.^138

लाट
5. Lāṭa^139 (No. 17, L. 3) The district or viṣaya of Lāṭa is here described as “pleasing with choice trees that are bowed down by the weight of (their) flowers, and with temples and assembly-halls of the gods, and with vihāras, (and) the mountains of which are covered over with vegetation”. The country south of Mahī or at times south of the Narbadā up to the Pūrva or so far as Daman, was called Lāṭa and ‘it corresponded roughly with Southern Gujarat’.^140 It comprised the collectorates of Surat, Bharoch, Kheda and parts of Baroda territory.^141 According to Prof. Bühler, Lāṭa is Central Gujarat, the district between the Mahī and Kim rivers and its chief city was Broach.^142 Lāṭa has been identified with Central and Southern Gujarat in the Rewah Stone Inscription of Karṇa.^143 We also find the Lāṭa kingdom mentioned in other epigraphical records.^144 Lāṭarāṣṭra^145 is identical with the old Lāṭa kingdom of Gujarat, the capital city of which is stated in the Dīpavaṁśa to have been Siṁapura (Sīhapura).^146 In the early days of the imperial Guptas, the Lāṭa country was formed into an administrative province in the Lāṭaviṣaya.^147 The Śaktisaṅgam Tantra places the Lāṭa country to the west of Avanti and to the northwest of Vidarbha.^148 Lāṭa is the same as the Larike of Ptolemy which lay to the east of Indo-Scythia along the sea-coast.^149 The word Lāṭa is derived from Sanskrit Rāṣṭra.^150 The Nāgara brāhmaṇas of Lāṭa (Gujarat) are said to have invented the Nāgarī character which is believed to have been derived from the Brāhmī alphabet.^151

वैव्य
6. Vaivya^152 (No. 40, L. 4): In this inscription the viṣaya of Vaivya is mentioned. The word Vaivya is inexplicable. We may, however, suggest that the term was possibly derived from Prakrit Vevva^153 which means ‘fear’ and hence Vaivya would mean ‘fearful’ or ‘dreadful’. Place-names ending in Maṇḍala

मण्डल
Maṇḍala Maṇḍala is a territorial unit which is found in the inscriptions of many dynasties of the early medieval period. Originally it denoted in the Arthaśāstra and other legal texts,^154 a diplomatic circle of twelve neighbouring kings, some friendly and others unfriendly, in relation to a king desirous of conquest. The term could also be used for the territory under the possession of a feudatory. But in the Gupta period maṇḍala is used for some kind of administrative division though in early medieval period its use was in feudalistic association.^155 In Cālukyan records, the governor of a maṇḍala was usually called a Maṇḍaleśvara or Mahāmaṇḍaleśvara.^156 In the records of the Imperial Guptas it denoted a unit smaller than a Vīthī.^157 Literally meaning a circle or round it denotes a district, province, country in general or it may signify a surrounding district or neighbouring state.^158

नागिरट्टमण्डल
1. Nāgiraṭṭamaṇḍala (No. 28, LL. 1-2): Nāgiraṭṭamaṇḍala formed a part of Dakṣiṇāṁśakavīthi in Puṇḍravardhana, the headquarters of the province of the same name. Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa seems to have formed the headquarters of the Nāgiraṭṭamaṇḍala^159 Nāgiraṭṭa is a Prakritic form of Nāgarāṣṭra.

उत्तरमण्डल
2. Uttaramaṇḍala (No. 52, L. 7): Literally it means ‘the Northern Maṇḍala’. The province might have been divided into four maṇḍalas in the four directions from the point of view of administration. The village Kānteḍadaka is described to have formed a part of the Uttaramaṇḍala as mentioned in the record.^160 Place-names with the suffix Pradeśa

प्रदेश
Pradeśa Fleet translates it as ‘place’^161 but the term has a specific use as an administrative division. Here it connotes a division^162 or may correspond with the word viṣaya used in the same context in the Eraṇ Stone Boar Inscription of Toramāṇa.^163 In modern usage pradeśa signifies a province. In our inscriptions we find only one place-name termed as Pradeśa.

ऐरिकिण
Airikiṇa (No. 2, L. 25): It has been described here as the bhoga-nagara of the king (svabhoga-nagara).^164 In this context the use of the phrase ‘Svabhoganagara’ is important. K.P. Jayaswal^165 interprets ‘sva bhoganagara’ as a town that had, since the victory scored by the Gupta king at Eraṇ, become his direct personal possession. Fleet translates it as ‘the city of his own enjoyment’.^166 Daśaratha Sharma^167 explains it as analogous to the word ‘Ekabhoga’ defined in the Mānasāra as a town or village inhabited by a single land-holder along with his dependants.^168 It is ‘Svabhoga’ for the master and ‘Ekabhoga’ for others’. Sharma connects this ‘Svabhoga’ with a feudatory ‘who lived therein with his family and dependants, and on whom Samudragupta, pleased by his ‘devotion’, policy, and valour’ conferred the litle of Rājan and the accompanying glories of consecration, etc. described in verse 4.^169 But Sharma seems to be incorrect in associating the inscription with a feudatory, the inscription belongs to Samudragupta himself which is clear by further description in subsequent verses.^170 No doubt in the Eraṇ Stone Boar Inscription of Toramāṇa^171 the word ‘sva-viṣaya’ an adjectival clause of Airikiṇa is used to refer to a feudatory, which is very clear from the inscription. The editor^172 also, following Sharma, is misled and explains the term ‘Svabhoga’ as implying a grant, or something like it by the governor of the province, who had for his own salary the revenues of the city of Airikiṇa allotted to him.^173 But the term ‘Svabhoganagara’ is significant in connoting royal status, higher than that of a feudatory chief and can mean ‘the capital city’ where the king himself was residing. In contrast, in the Earṇ Stone Boar Inscription of Toramāṇa^174 the term ‘Sva-viṣaya’ has been used for the feudatory Dhanyaviṣṇu (of king Toramāṇa) who may have been a viṣayapati, the administrator-incharge of Eraṇ. Airikiṇa is the same as modern Eraṇ, the ancient Airikiṇa, a village on the left bank of the Bina, in Sagar District of Madhya Pradesh. From the Copper Coins of the Aśokan period found at Eraṇ, we get an earlier Pali or Prakrit form of the name which is Erakaña or Erakana or Erakaṇa.^175 It is thus clear that Erakaña or Erakaṇa is the simplified form of Erikiṇa: to simplify still more the medial letter ‘k’ has been dropped by the process of elision.^176 The meaning of the word Erikiṇa is a puzzle but its connexion with erakā ‘a kind of grass,^177 found in that area may be accepted as a hypothesis. Place-names ending in Deśa

देश
Deśa It means a province, country, kingdom.^178 Sometimes it is used as a technical territorial term. But its exact meaning and bearing are difficult to explain due to the fact that sometimes it is described as bigger and at others smaller than other geographical divisions, such as maṇḍala, rāṣṭra and viṣaya.^179 We find only one reference each in the Brāhmaṇas^180 and the Vājasaneyī Saṁhitā.^181 The passage in the Vājasaneyī Saṁhitā is significant in as much as here for the first time, deśa is used in the sense of a ‘country’. We find a reference to the river Sarasvatī as flowing in the Madhyadeśa or ‘Middle Country’. The term was much in vogue in the Upaniṣad and Sūtra period denoting therein the meaning ‘land’.

म्लेच्छदेश
1. Mleccha-deśa (No. 14, L. 4): There is a mention of the Mleccha countries in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Skandagupta (No. 14). But the record does not refer to any boundary of the Mlecchas.^182

सुकुलिदेश
2. Sukuli-deśa (No. 5, L. 4): It will literally mean ‘a country possessing noble families in it’. It seems to have been a place near Sāñcī in Madhya Pradesh. Place-names ending in Rājya

राज्य
Rājya Rājya means a kingdom, country, realm (= rāṣṭra).^183 In the Vedic period the term ‘Rājya’ regularly denoted sovereign power. In addition to this there were other expressions referring to sovereign power.^184 In the ritual of the Rājasūya, the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa^185 gives a whole series of terms: Rājya, Sāmrājya, Bhaujya, Svārājya, Vairājya, Pārameṣṭhya, and Māhārājya. We find only one name ending with this suffix in our inscriptions which is given below:

ऐरावतगोराज्य
Airāvata-go-rājya (No. 35, L. 9): The name is not clearly legible. But D.C. Sircar takes the reading to be ‘Airāvata-go-rājye’. Airāvata-go-rājya may literally mean ‘a kingdom where elephants and cows are found’.^186 It was situated in the viṣaya of Koṭivarṣa which formed a part of the Puṇḍravardhana bhukti.^187 Place-names ending in Vīthi

वीथि
Vīthi It is spelt both as vīthi and vīthī and means a row, line, road, way or street.^188 But in the inscription it has been used to refer to an administrative division. It seems to have been smaller than a viṣaya (district) and bigger than a maṇḍala.^189 We find only one name with this suffix in one inscription which is given below:

दक्षिणांशकवीथि
Dakṣiṇāṁśaka-vīthi (No. 28, L. 1): Literally it means ‘a road forming the southern part’ of the city. It seams to have formed part of the Puṇḍravardhana district and Nāgiraṭṭamaṇḍala was included in it.^190 Place-names with the suffix Patha

पथ
Patha (footpath) ‘Patha’ in Zend. The sanskrit spelling (th) is loaned from Iran. Greek relatives are patos (path) and pontos (mariners' path, sea-route: sea). Initial p is dropped in old Irish: pathin (path) and pons (bridge) recur as ath (ford)’. Russian pant (path) and pent (ford).^191 Monier Williams derives it from §panth to go, to move. It means a way, path, a road or route.^192 In the Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra^193 we find the word ‘Jaṅghā-patha (foot-path)’. The suffix ‘patha’ has been used as early as the later Vedic period.^194 Originally patha meant ‘a path’, ‘a road’ but later on it came to denote ‘a country’. Even now-a-days, the suffix ‘road’ is used for inhabitations and localities. Following are the place-names ending in this suffix:

आद्यपथ
(1) Ādyapatha (No. 43, L. 23): It was situated to the east of a village called Gulmagandhikā.^195 Literally Ādyapatha means ‘the first route’. It seems to have beena small area like a mohalla.

दक्षिणापथ
(2) Dakṣiṇāpatha (No. I, L. 20): According to inscription No. 1 all the kings of the region of the north were conquered by Samudragupta who attained great fame by liberating them.^196 The kingdoms specifically named as included in the southern region are: Kosala, Mahākāntāra, Kurāḷa, Piṣṭapura, Koṭṭūra, Eraṇḍapalla, Kāñcī, Avamukta, Veṅgī, Palakka, Devarāṣṭra and Kusthalapura.^197 “The earliest epigraphical mention of the Dakṣiṇāpatha is found in the Nānāghaṭ Cave Inscription (Second half of first Century B.C.)^198 It later appears in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradāman (A.D. 150)^199 as also in the Nasik Cave Inscription of Vāsiṣṭhīputra Pulumāvi (A.D. 149).^200 Literally it means ‘the path or road leading to the south’ and in short the ‘south country’. As a designation of the Deccan,^201 the term is found as early as the Baudhāyana Dharmasūtra.^202 A similar expression is Dakṣiṇā padā, ‘with southward foot’, occurring in the Ṛgveda,^203 and refers to the place to which exiles are expelled.^204 Thus the term denoted ‘South’ beyond the limits of the recognised Āryan world. In the Buddhist literature originally the name seems to have been restricted to a remote settlement on the Upper Godāvarī.^205 Some hold that it was situated to the south of the Narbadā and was identical with the Dakhinabades of the Greeks.^206 According to the Yādavaprakāśa, Dakṣiṇāpatha is the name of the country to the south of the Vindhyas and includes Pāṇḍya, Kuntala, Cola, Mahārāṣṭra, Kerala, Kulya, Setuja, Kulakālaka, Iṣīka, Śabara, Āraṭṭa and other countries.^207 Rājaśekhara places it ahead of Māhiṣmatī. Countries situated in it are: Mahārāṣṭra, Māhiṣaka, Aśmaka, Vidarbha, Kuntala, Krathakaiśika, Sūrpāraka, Kāñcī, Kerala, Kavera, Murala, Vanavāsaka, Siṁhala, Coḍa, Daṇḍaka, Pāṅḍya, Pallava, Gāṅga, Nāśikya, Koṅkaṇa Kollagiri, Vallara, etc.^208 Thus we see that Dakṣiṇāpatha in later times came to represent more or less the whole of the south. Place-names with the suffix Pura

पुर्
Pur or Pura Pur is a word of frequent occurrence in the Ṛgveda.^209 The early Vedic Āryans were not city builders. Puras^210 which are mentioned from the context seem to have been always associated with the dasyus and the enemies of the Āryans.^211 Pura, the oldest Sanskrit word denoting city, is usually derived from the Dravidian ur. From what we read in the Ṛgveda about Puraṁdara's exploits in connection with the destruction of the ninety-nine puras of the Asuras who had been causing havoc to the gods, these puras seem to refer to the cities of the Indus Valley pre-Āryans.^212 But the word ur is not available in Dravidian lexicons: on the contrary it is pura which is mentioned by them.^213 The word ur is not to be traced in the I. E. languages.^214 We find Ur only as the name of a town in Babylonia.^215 In Tamil country, in the inscriptions of the Chola dynasty (A.D. 900-1300) the word ‘ur’ is used to refer to ‘The Primary Assembly of the villagers’ in the case of ordinary villages while in the same context the word Sabhā is used in case of Agrahāra villages, mostly tenanted by learned brāhmaṇas.^216 In the later Vedic literature^217 the word Pur meant ‘rampart’, ‘fort’, or ‘stronghold’. The meaning of Pura as ‘city’ developed later and was not at all in vogue in the Vedic literature. Lexicons define it as a place containing large buildings surrounded by a ditch and extending not less than one Kośa in length, if it extends for half that distance it is called a kheṭa; if less than that, a karvaṭa or small market town, any smaller cluster of houses is called a grāma or village.^218 The Sama rāṅgaṇasūtradhāra describes puras as being of three kinds<BR> -Big, middle and small which have different measurements for their ditches, buildings, streets and road-ways.^219 The big one possesses a circumference of four thousand arcs, the middle of two thousand arcs and the small of one thousand arcs.^220 T. Burrow derives pura from §pri to fill Piparti ‘fills’: pur ‘city’: Lithuanian pilis (l becomes r).^221 We find the word being spelt in two ways pur^222 and pura^223 Pur (city), from puru (much) and pūrṇa (full) means ‘plentitude’ or multitude of settlers. Similarly Greek polis (city) from poly (much): Latin populus (population, people) from plenus (full), and English folk from full. Pur is the city and puruṣa the citizen. Greek polites (citizens), is preserved in politics (civic concerns), police (city administration), and cosmopolitan (citizen of the world): Lithuanian pilis (fort, castle).^224 In modern times the word purā (from pura) is used for mohalla in India. It seems to be the result of Muslim contact.^225 Pura, where it does not retain the original from pur, is changed into the following^226: (a) Wār: as Purushapura, Peshawar; Nalapura, Narwar; Matipura, Madwār; Śalwapura, Alwar; Candrapura, Candwar. (b) Urs or ur, as Māyāpura, Mayura; Siṁhapura, Siṅgur; Juṣkapura, Zukur (c) Or, as Traipura, Tcor; Candrādityapura, Caindor (d) Ora, as Ilbalapura, Ellora (e) Ore, as Lavapura, Lahore (f) Ola, as Āryapura, Aihole (g) ar, as Kusumapura, Kumrār (h) aur, as Siddhapura, Siddhaur (i) Own, as Hiraṇyapura, Hindoun or Herdoun There are many names with the suffix Pura in the Aṣṭādhyāyī, Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya and the Kāśikā.^227 The word Mahāpura in the Yajurveda Saṁhitās^228 and the Brāhmaṇas^229 denotes a great fortress. Probably the only difference between the Pur and Mahāpura was in their size.^230 Following are the place-names ending in the suffix pura:

अजपुर
(1) Ajapura (No. 12, L. 25): In Inscription No. 12, we find the mention of the town of Aja pura. The name of the viṣaya of which it was a part has been damaged. Since the column bearing the inscription was originally found in front of the northern gate of the odl fort of Bihar,^231 we can easily identify Ajapura with the modern village of the same name in the Rājagṛha viṣaya which is not very far from Nālandā.^232 The name of the viṣaya which included this town can possibly be restored as Rājagṛha in the damaged part of the inscription.

चन्द्रापुर
(2) Candrāpura^233 (No. 16, L. 5): It is the name of Indrapura. See Indrapura.

दशपुर
(3) Daśapura (No. 17, L. 4, L. 16): In this inscription L. 4 refers to the migration of a guild of silkweavers from Lāṭa viṣaya (Central and Southern Gujarat) to the city of Daśapura. The guild came to this city attracted by the virtues of its kings.^234 The inscription refers itself to the reign of king Kumāragupta, under whom Bandhuvarman, the son of Viśvavarman^235 was the governor at Daśapura. L. 16 of the inscription records that it was under the governorship of Bandhuvarman (in Mālava era 493 = A.D. 437)^236, that a lofty temple of the Sun-god was caused to be built by the guild of silk-cloth weavers at Daśapura.^237 Afterwards, under other kings, part of this temple fell into disrepair. And then it was restored by the same guild in the year 529 of the Mālava era (= A.D. 473).^238 Daśapura has been identified with Mandasor in Western Malwa^239 formerly in the Gwalior State. The ancient Daśapura stood on the north or left bank of the Siwana, a tributary of the river Śiprā.^240 We also find it mentioned in the Mandasor Fragmentary Inscription of the time of Ādityavardhana (A.D. 490-500).^241 Under the Imperial Guptas the use of the Mālava or the Kṛta era seems to have been confined to Daśapura.^242 Thus Daśapura may have been the main city of the Western Mālavas. We also get a reference to Daśapura in the Bṛhatsaṁhitā^243 and the Meghadūta^244 of Kālidāsa. The ancient Sanskrit name Daśapura also occurs in an early Nasik inscription of Uṣavadāta,^245 and in one inscription of Vikram Saṁvat 1321 (= A.D. 1264) from Mandasor itself.^246 There are two explanations of the name Daśapura or Dasor. The local explanation is that the place was originally a city of the Puranic king Daśaratha. But, on this view, the name of the city should have been Daśarathapura or Dasrathore. Fleet points out that even now, the township includes some twelve to fifteen outlying hamelets or divisions (Khilcipur, Jankūpurā, Rāmpuriyā, Candrapurā, Bālagañja, etc.) and that ‘when it was originally constituted, it included exactly ten (daśa) such hamlets (pura)’.^247 This view of Fleet is more appealing. Mandasor, the full form of the name of the town by which it is officially known and which is entered in maps, is also explained in two ways: As suggested by Bhagwan Lal Indraji, it may represent Manda-Daśapura, “the distressed or afflicted Daśapura,” referring to the overthrow of the town, and the destruction of the Hindu temples in it, by the Musalmans, in memory of which, even to the present day, the Nāgar brāhmaṇas of the area do not drink water there. This is supported by the fact that some paṇḍits still call it Mannadasor.^248 F.S. Growse suggests that the name combines the two names of Mad and Daśapura: the former^249 being the name of a village (also called Afzalpur) about eleven miles south-east of Mandasor, from which, it is said, were brought, from ruined Hindu temples, the stones that were used in the construction of the Musalman fort at Mandasor.^250 It is very difficult to choose between the two explanations, but the second seems to be more reasonable.

इन्द्रपुर
(4) Indrapura (No. 16, L. 5, L. 6, L. 7, L. 8): The inscription states that an endowment was given by a brāhmaṇa named Devaviṣṇu for the maintenance of a lamp in a temple of the Sun established by the merchants of the town of Indrapura kṣatriyas named Acalavarman and Bhrukuṇṭhasiṁha at Indrapura. In line 5 we get ‘Candrāpuraka-Padmā’ as the reading taken by Fleet^251 and he thus considers it a separate town than Indrapura.^252 But the correct reading should be as ‘Cendrapuraka-Padmā’, since we find a small stroke by the left side of ‘c’. The stroke in other lines for ‘e’ is very clear (e. g. in L. 2) though it is not very clear in L. 5 still we cannot read it simply ‘c’. The reading ‘ce’ for ‘c’ has been suggested by Sircar and Jagannath.^253 Thus we see that the Padmā referred in line 5 of this inscription also belongs to Indrapura. Now we find two different spellings of Indrāpura in lines 5 and 6 and Indrapura in lines 7 and 8.^254 What we can find out here is that the affix ‘ka’ in lines 5 and 6 is very important which seems to have grammatically a succinct purpose here. The vṛddhi of the first vowel ‘i’ was desirable here as is also clear by the use of affix ‘ka’ in the Allahabad Inscription of Samudragupta.^255 So it is a weaker form of the affix ‘ka’, without vṛddhi of the vowel in the first syllable.^256 The writer seems to have used the long vowel (with the last syllable of Indra) instead of vṛddhi in the first syllable to avoid confusion between Aindrapura and Indrapura. We do not find any such example of the elongation of vowel in the classical Sanskrit literature though we find its rare use in Vedic literature.^257 So we shall translate ‘Indrāpuraka Padmā’ as ‘Padmā of (the town of) Indrapura and ‘Indrapurakavaṇigbhyām’ as ‘merchants of (the town of) Indrapura’. This Indrapura is the same as modern Indor,^258 near Dibhāi, Bulandshahr district, U.P.^259 The ancient town of Indrapura was situated on a large and lofty mound about five miles to the north-west of Dibhāi.^260 Now-a-days it is only a kheḍā or deserted mound, and is not shown in maps^261

कर्तृपुर
(5) Kartṛpura (No. I, L. 22): Though the most accepted and correct reading is Kartṛpura, some scholars prefer to read Katṛpura^262 or Kātripura.^263 It is one of the five frontier kingdoms^264 mentioned in the inscription whose kings did homage and paid tribute to Samudragupta. Scholars differ in their views about the identification of this place-name: According to smith,^265 this kingdom ‘occupied the lower ranges of the western Himalayas, including probably Kumaon, Garhwal, and Kangra’. Oldham^266 holds that the kingdom of Kātripura, included Kumaun, Almora, Garhwal and Kangra. Fleet^267 suggests that the name may survive in Kartarpur in the Jullundur district. We prefer the view of Daśaratha Sharma.^268 His contention is that amongst the five frontier kingdoms mentioned in the inscription, the first three belong to the East, the fourth one belongs to the North, hence it will be better to leave aside the northern and eastern sides of the empire and to look for Kartṛpura somewhere to the west of the Gupta dominions. Consequently he finds Karor or Karūr to be a good equivalent for Kartṛpura.^269 Kara here stands for Kartṛ and ‘ur’ or ‘ūr’ would stand here for pura.^270 Karūr, again, is to be perferred to the other alternatives on account of its associations with the Gupta period of Indian History. According to Al-Beruni, an eastern king, called Vikramāditya, put to flight and killed a Śaka ruler in the region of Karūr, between Multan and Loni.^271 This Vikramāditya is to be identified with Candragupta II ‘the enemy of the Śakas’, who disguised as his brother's wife, Dhruvasvāminī, ‘ripped upon the belley of the Śaka ruler’, and destroyed the Śaka army, most probably, in Kartṛpura or Karūr.^272 This was the first encounter between the Śakas and Vikramāditya, and Karūr, Karor, or Kartṛpura was the theatre of the war because of its intermediate position between the Śaka dominions and the Gupta empire.^273

क्रीपुर
(6) Krīpura (No. 52, L. 1): Krīpura was the place from which Vainyagupta issued his landgrant in A.D. 507-08, was evidently the seat of his government.^274 It was the victorious camp full of great ships and elephants and horses (situated).^275 The place is of unknown identity,^276 but is possibly to be looked for in Bengal.^277 Literally the name can mean a ‘market-town’.

कुस्थलपुर
(7) Kusthalapura (No. I, L. 20): Kusthalapura ruled by Dhanañjaya is mentioned as one of the Dakṣiṇāpatha kingdoms subdued by Samudragupta. Smith takes it to be a mistake for Kuśasthalapura,^278 and identifies it with the holy city of Dwarka, the capital of Ānartta, i. e. North Gujarat.^279 Raj Bali Pandey also identifies it with Kuśasthalī (Dwarka)^280 G. Ramdas locates the place in Gujarat following Smith.^281 Monier Williams also indentifies Kuśasthala with the town of Dwarka.^282 Bhandarkar, following Barnett identifies the place with Kuttalur near Polur in North Arcot.^283 This Kuśasthalī is not situated in Gujarat but presumably on the eastern spurs of the Vindhya range near Daksiṇakosala.^284 It was the capital of Kuśa, son of Rāmacandra.^285 But its position in the list of the States of Dakṣiṇāpatha indicates a place a little more to the south. By the process of Haplology,^286 Kuśasthalapura is simplified into Kusthalapura which may be changed to Kuśasthalī or Kuśāvatī in short. The suffix sthala or sthalī is significant: it suggests a highlying country, an eminence, tableland, or dry-land as opposed to a damp low-land.^287 The Mahābhārata, Harivaṁśa, early Jain and Pali literature use the word in this sense.^288 The Mahābhārata mentions both Kuśasthala as well as kuśa-sthalī. The latter is supposed to be another name of Dwarka.^289

पाटलिपुत्र
(8) Pāṭaliputra (No. 7, L. 12; No. 6, L. 4; No. 1, L. 14): It is the same as modern Patna situated to the south of the river Gaṅgā. Inscription No. 7 refers to Pāṭaliputra. Inscription No. 6 mentions Vīrasena, the child of Kutsa, the minister for peace and war under Candragupta II, who knew the meanings of the words, and logic, and (the ways of) mankind, who was a poet and who belonged to (the city of) Pāṭaliputra.^290 Inscription No. 1 mentions a city named Puṣpa where Samudragupta enjoyed playfully while he was young.^291 Apparently, the city was the Gupta capital. We also find the word Pāṭaliputa (Pāṭaliputra) used by Aśoka, in his rock edicts.^292 The city was also known as Kusumapura due to the abundance of flowers.^293 Its name Puṣpapura is also met with in the Raghuvaṁśa.^294 It is mentioned in the Mudrārākṣasa as well.^295 The Kathāsaritsāgara of Somadeva^296 (11th century) describes it as a place of both wealth and education though generally there is a fight between Śrī (lakṣmī) and Sarasvatī.^297 The Kāvyamīmāṁsā of Rājaśekhara (A.D. 900) mentions a tradition that there were assemblies of scholars called brahmasabhās, organised by kings, which examined poets like Kālidāsa, Bhartṛmaṇṭha, Amara, Rūpa, Āryaśūra, Bhāravi and Candragupta in Viśālā (Ujjainī) and where such great masters of grammar as Upavarṣa, Pāṇini, Piṅgala, Vyāḍi, Vararūci and Patañjali were examined in Pāṭaliputra and attained fame.^298 The Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa^299 (A.D. 800) mentions Pāṭaliputra as Nandanagara. This work refers to king Nanda, his learned Council of brāhmaṇa philosophers and to his intimacy with Pāṇini. “After him (Sūrasena) there will be king Nanda at Puṣpa city. In the capital of the Magadha residents there will be brāhmaṇa controversialists and the king will be surrounded by them. The king will give them riches. His minister was a Buddhist brāhmaṇa, Vararūci, who was of high soul, kind and good. His great friend was a brāhmaṇa, Pāṇini by name”.^300 The Kāśikā^301 records two divisions of Pāṭaliputra: 1. Pūrva-Pāṭaliputra (eastern on the Gaṅgā) 2. Apara-Pāṭaliputra (western on the Śoṇa) Patañjali^302 mentions the western Pāṭaliputra. A citizen of Pāṭaliputra was called Pāṭaliputraka.^303 The city is named as Palibothra by Megasthenes, the Ambassador of Seleucus Nicator at the court of King Candragupta Maurya.^304 The Pāla inscriptions refer to it by the name Śrīnagara.^305 The termination ‘Putra’ in Pāṭaliputra is difficult to explain. We find it being used with ‘Brahman’ to denote the river ‘Brahmaputra’. As regards places-names we find the mention of Saitya puta (Satiya-putra) and Kerala-puta (Kerala putra) in Aśokan Rock-edicts.^306 The name Pāṭaliputra is taken to mean “the son (putra) of Pāṭali, i. e. the trumpet flower. The words Puṣpapura and Kusumapura also mean ‘a city of flowers’. The word ‘Śrīnagara’ means ‘a beautiful city.^307 Because of the abundance of flowers the city may have looked beautiful. It was known by other names also, viz., Puṣpapura, Puspapurī and Kusumapura.^308 According to Yuan-Chwang, it had been called Kusumapura (K' u-su-mo-pu-lo) on account of the numerous flowers (kusuma) in the royal enclosure.^309 Later its glory was replaced by that of Kānyakubja which came to be known as Kusumapura.^310 The meaning of ‘Pāṭaliputra’ is explained in the legendary origin of the city. According to the legend: there was a brāhmaṇa of high talent and singular learning. Many flocked to him to receive instruction. One day all his students went out on a tour of observation. One of them looked very sad. When asked, he told that his life was waning without any company. In a joke his friends made the Pāṭali tree, under which they were standing, his father-in-law: in other words he was to marry the daughter of the tree, or a Pāṭali flower (Bignonia Suaveloens).^311 As the Sun was about to set, all the students proposed to return home but the young student fascinated by love stayed there fearlessly. Accidentally, next day he was married with the young daughter of an old couple. After a year his wife gave birth to a son. He declined to stay there fearing the exposure to wind and weather. But the old man (the father of the wife) constructed a house for him and made him stay there. When the old capital of Kusumapura was changed, this town was chosen, and “as the genie built the mansion for the youth the country was named as Pāṭaliputrapura (the city of the son of the Pāṭali tree).”^312 It is not unlikely that originally the name of the city was Pāṭaliputrapura and that later suffix Pura was dropped. The Buddhist literature informs us that Pāṭaliputra was originally a village known as Pāṭaligāma. Ajātaśatru is said to have fortified it in order to check the attacks of the Licchavis who often harassed its inhabitants. The Buddha on his way from Rājagṛha to Vaiśālī, passed through this village on his last journey and is said to have predicted that the village was destined to become a great city.^313 The Vāyu-Purāṇa attributes the real foundation of Pāṭaliputra to Rājā Ajāta-Śatru's grandson, Udaya or Udayāśva. It was he who first removed the capital from Rājagṛha to Pāṭaliputra (during the last part of the 6th century B.C.)^314 Pāṭaliputra had closely been associated with multifarious political and cultural activities right from the fifth century B.C. to the later part of the sixth century A.D.^315 It had the honour to be the capital of the Śaiśunāgas, the Nandas, the Mauryas and the great Imperial Guptas uptil the Hūṇa invasion in the 6th century A.D. when it was ruined. Harṣavardhana (7th century A.D.) made no attempt to restore it.^316 Śaśāṅka Narendragupta destroyed many Buddhist temples and monasteries at Pāṭaliputra.^317 Dharmapāla, the most powerful of the Pāla kings of Bengal and Bihar, tried to restore its glory.^318 Coming to medieval times, we find that it remained deserted for a number of centuries. It was Sher Shah, who, in about A.D. 1541 occupied it again as a royal city and built a fort there. It then came into importance under its modern name Patna (from Skt. Pattana) i. e. the town or city. It is even now the capital of Bihar.^319

पिष्टपुर
(9) Piṣṭapura (No. 1, L. 19): It has been mentioned as one of the southern regions which were first caputred and then liberated by Samudragupta.^320 Mahendragiri is mentioned as its king. Piṣṭapura is the same as the fortress Piṣṭapura captured by the Cālukya king Pulakeśin II. The Tāṇḍivāda grant of Pṛthivī Mahārāja also refers to Piṣṭapura.^321 Piṣṭapura is modern Pithapuram in the Godavari district of the Madras Presidency.^322 It was the capital of Kaliṅga.^323 ‘Kaliṅgādhipati’ Anantavarman issued a grant^324 from the victorious city of Piṣṭapura. This grant records that Anantavarman's grandfather Guṇavarman ruled over Devarāṣṭra with Piṣṭapura as its chief city.^325 In our inscription Devarāṣṭra^326 has been treated separately. It seems that during Samudragupta's time these two States (Devarāṣṭra and Kaliṅga) were separate states but later on under Guṇavarman they were amalgamated. Guha ruled over the whole of Kaliṅga and the neighbouring regions.^327 Guha belonged to the Sālaṅkāyana family of brāhmaṇas. Samudragupta installed him as his viceroy in Kaliṅga.^328 Guha was already reigning over Kaliṅga (with his capital at Piṣṭapura) when Samudragupta conquered him and placed him as his feudatory. ‘Mahendragiri’ may have been another name given to him on account of the extension of his dominion over the Mahendra mountain.^329 It is interesting to note that Kālidāsa^330 refers to Raghu defeating a king named Mahendranātha in the course of his southern campaign. It is tempting to connect Mahendranātha with Mahendragiri. After the victory of Samudragupta, Guha was confirmed in the enjoyment of sovereignty under the imperial tutelage.^331 At Piṣṭapura there is a Vaiṣṇava temple named Kuntimādhava.^332 We get references to Piṣṭapurī or Piṣṭapurikādevī, a form at Mānapura, of the goddess Lakṣmī, in the inscriptions of the Privrājaka Mahārājas and the Mahārājas of Uccakalpa during the Gupta period.^333 This must be a local form of some popular goddess at Piṣṭapura itself.^334 Place-names ending in the Suffix Nagara

नगर
Nagara: Nagara means a town, a city.^335 we find the term being used by Pāṇini (IV. 2. 142).^336 The word Nāgaraka (or Nāgarika)^337 also occurs in Sanskrit literature as standing for ‘an inhabitant of a town’ but sometimes its use was restricted for the chief of a town or a police-officer. In modern times nāgarika is used to refer to ‘a citizen of a state whether living in city or village’. In the early Vedic literature Nagara is found only as the derivative adjective Nagarin, used as a proper name, but it appears in the sense of ‘town’ in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (1. 11, 18: 31, 4) and frequently in the later works.^338 Nagara is an important factor which helps us to distinguish Janapada from rāṣṭra: nagara forms a part of the rāṣṭra but is excluded from the Janapada.^339 Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra uses Nagara and Pura as synonyms.^340 It is significant that the word Nagara is of late occurrence.^341 It is likely that in the early Vedic times city life does not seem to have developed much. In the Epic,^342 there are references to Nagara, ‘a city’: Grāma ‘Village’: and Ghoṣa ‘ranch’. Vedic literature especially of the earlier period is generally confined to the village. The siege of puras is mentioned in the Saṁhitās and Brāhmaṇas. The word Nagara is changed into:^343 (a) Nar as Kuśīnagara, Kusinar, Girinagara, Girnar (b) Ner as Jīrṇanagara, Jooner. In modern times the suffix nagara is sometimes used to denote an inhabitation or Mohalla e. g. Tilak Nagar, Subhash Nagar, Patel Nagar, Jawahar Nagar, Lajapat Nagar. We do not find any place-name with the suffix ‘nagara’ in our records but with a little change in the same sense with the suffix nagarī, which is given below:

पञ्चनगरी
Pañcanagarī (No. 44, L. 1): It was the chief town of the district, where Kulavṛddhi's Court was situated.^344 D.C. Sircar considers it to be modern Pāncbibi in the Bogra District and the same as Pentapolis of Ptolemy.^345 Pañcanagarī literally means ‘a multitude of five towns’. Five small localities might have been collected into one for the smoothness of administration. Place-names ending in Nauyoga

नौयोग
Nauyoga: Literally meaning ‘a place for parking boats’ it signifies ‘a harbour’. Following are the place-names which have been termed as ‘nauyoga’ or harbour.

चूडामणि
1. Cūḍāmaṇi^346 (No. 52, L. 28): Literally meaning ‘a jewel worn by men and women on the top of the head’ it denotes ‘the best or most excellent’.^347 Combined with its epithet nauyuga, Cūḍāmaṇi signifies ‘the best of harbours’.

नगरश्री
2. Nagaraśrī (No. 52, L. 28): Literally Nagaraṣrī means ‘the glory of the town’. Combined with its epithet nauyoga it means ‘the harbour of Nagaraśrī’. It seems to have been an important part of the town.

प्रडामार
3. Praḍāmāra (No. 52, L. 29): It has also been described as a nauyoga.^348 The meaning of Praḍāmāra is difficult to explain. It seems to be the Sanskritised form of the Prakrit Paḍāmāra, i. e. a place where clothes or tents are found in abundance or it may signify ‘a harbour of “pāla-boats”.^349 Place-names ending in Kaṭaka

कटक
Kaṭaka: It is formed from the root §kaṭ to surround, to encompass, to cover and means a ‘royal camp’.^350 There is only one such place-name with the suffix ‘Kaṭaka’ which is as follows: ...Kaṭaka (No. 29, L. 12): The first part is not clearly legible. Sircar takes it to be bhrātṛ^351 but does not seem to be correct as it yields no sense with the word Kaṭaka. The donated land is mentioned to have been given to the Chandoga (Sāmavedin) brāhmaṇa Varāha-svāmin, an inhabitant of this Kaṭaka.^352 Place-names ending in Vāsaka

वासक
Vāsaka: It means an abode or inhabitation.^353 An inhabitation can be big or small. In referring to a big inhabitation it denotes a city. Following are the names with this suffix:

आनन्दपुरवासक
(1) Ānandapuravāsaka^354 (No. 40, L. 1): It has been mentioned as a camp of victory. Ānandapura literally means ‘a city of pleasure’. It has not been identified so far.

अयोध्या
(2) Ayodhyā (No. 21, L. 1; No. 37, L. 6; No. 39, L. 10): In No. 21 the word ‘Ayodhyā-Vāsaka’ occurs^355 while in No. 37 and 39 the word ‘Āyodhyaka’ has been mentioned. In No, 21, Ayodhyā is described as a victorious camp. full of great ships, and elephants and horses. In No. 39 certain brāhmaṇas belonging to Ayodhyā, living in the vicinity of Mahādeva Śaileśvara are named and are mentioned as belonging to various gotras and caraṇas, and as proficient in observants, in sacred duty, in the mantras, the sūtras, bhāṣyas and pravacanas.^356 It has been venerated as one of the most important and holy places of the Hindus.^357 Vinītā was another name for this city.^358 Its other names including Viṇīā (Vinītā) are mentioned in the Vividhatīrthakalpa.^359 Fa-Hsien calls it Sha-che and Ptolemy knew it as Sogeda.^360 Ayodhyā and Sāketa have been treated by many writers as being identical. Csoma de kōrös^361 calls this place as “Sāketan or Ayodhyā” and H.H. Wilson in his dictionary, refers to Sāketa as ‘the city of Ayodhyā’. Several passages in the Raghuvaṁśa^362 confirm it. The Vividhatīrthakalpa mentions Sākeyam (Sāketa) as a synonym for Ayodhyā,^363 but in the Buddhist literature we find separate references to Ayodhyā and Sāketa which creates doubt about their identity and suggests that the two existed separately.^364 V. Pathak quotes a well known verse occurring in the Yuga Purāṇa, a section of Gārgī Saṁhitā,^365 to show that Sāketa is the same as Ayodhyā. But there is nothing in the passage to support the view. The ancient city of Ayodhyā or Sāketa is described in the Rāmāyaṇa as situated on the banks of the Sarayū or Sarjū river.^366 During the Buddhist period, Ayodhyā was divided into Uttara (Northern) Kosala and Dakṣiṇa (Southern) Kosala. The river Sarayū was the dividing line between the two provinces. Ayodhyā was the capital of the latter.^367 Ancient tradition believes it to have been built by Manu.^368 The history of Kośala, with its mighty King Prasenajit and his son Vidudabha pales into insignificance with the emergence of the Magadhan rulers as powerful antagonists. The Nandas, followed by the Mauryas, assimilated Kośala in their empire. Under the Śuṅgas, it was being ruled by a viceroy. An inscription from Ayodhyā mentions Puṣyamitra as having performed two horse-sacrifices. Under the Kuṣāṇas, the city remained more or less in oblivion. Subsequently in the Purāṇas it figures along with Prayāga and Magadha as forming part of the kingdom of the Guptas. The spurious Gayā Plate of Samudragupta (No. 21) mentions it as a seat of a Gupta camp of victory. The history of the city in the postGupta period is wrapped up in obscurity. It was within the empire of the Pratihāras and Gāhaḍavālas of Kanauj. Ayodhyā is described by Muslim historians^369 to have been a wilderness. The Slaves and Khilji rulers held sway over it, and subsequently it received importance as the headquarters of Oudh. It was under the charge of Muslim governors appointed from Delhi, but with the emergence of Jaunpur as a strong kingdom Ayodhyā was completely over-shadowed. It was a mint-town in the time of Akbar, but there is no reference to it in later Chronicles.^370 Ayodhyā is important as a centre of pilgrimage. There are several places in the city connected with different events in the life of Rāma. Rāma was born at a place called Janmasthāna. At Chīrodaka also called Chīrasāgara, Daśaratha performed, with the help of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga Ṛṣi, the sacrifices for obtaining a son. At a place called Tretā-kā-Ṭhākur, Rāmacandra performed the horse sacrifice by setting up the image of Sītā. At Ratnamaṇḍapa, he held his Council,^371 at Swargadwāram in Fyzabad, his body was burnt. At Lakṣmaṇa-kuṇḍa, Lakṣmaṇa disappeared in the river Sarayū. Daśaratha accidentally killed Śravaṇa, the blind Ṛṣi's son, at Majhaurā in the district of Fyzabad.^372 Ayodhyā engaged the attention of the Muslim rulers some of whom set up mosques here, of these the mosques of Babar and and Aurangzeb are notable.^373 At present this city forms a part of the district of Fyzabad.

ईश्वरवासक
(3) Īśvaravāsaka (No. 5, L. 6)^374: It seems to be a village or an allotment of land granted by Āmrakārddava, the son of Undāna, and apparently an officer of Candragupta II to the Āryasaṁgha at the great vihāra of Kākanādaboṭa for the purpose of feeding mendicants.^375 The word Īśvara here is connected with Vāsaka and there is no infix or place-name suffix in between (just as ‘pura’ in Ānandapuravāsaka). Hence vāsaka here has a double purpose. It is meaningful to Īśvara and also denotes the inhabitation. The whole will literally mean ‘an inhabitation of God’.

वन
Place-names ending in Vana We find some place-names with the suffix denoting forest, for example Vindhyāṭavī, and Vṛndāvana. In our inscriptions we come across only three such names, Tumbavana and Vindhāṭavī, and Mahākāntāra. The suffixes vana, aṭavī and kāntāra are synonyms. These are described below:

तुम्बवन
1. Tumbavana (No. 30, L. 6): It has been identified with Tumain in Guna district, the old Gwalior State, now in Madhya Pradesh. It is also mentioned in the Sāñcī Stūpa inscription.^376 The Bṛhatsaṁhitā^377 refers to it as situated in the South. The name suggests that Tumba, the gourd Lagenaria vulgaris was in abundance at this place.

महाकान्तार
2. Mahākāntāra (No. 1, L. 19): It is one of the southern countries subdued by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Vyāghararāja. Literally Mahākāntāra means ‘a great forest’. It has to be distinguished from Sarvāṭavi referred to later on in this inscription.^378 According to Krishnaswami Aiyangar,^379 it must have included the Saugar division of C.P. extending northwards to the Ajaigadh State in Bundelkhanda. But G. Ramdas differs from this view on the ground that Mahākāntāra must be sought in Southern India as it is specifically mentioned as one of the kingdoms of the South conquered by Samudragupta. He suggests that Mahākāntāra must be the same as Mahāvana, a forest region extending northwards into Ganjam Agency and westwards into the tract formerly known as the Chatisgarh States of C.P.^380 This very region has been mentioned by the same name in the Ganj and Nachna inscriptions.^381

विन्ध्याटवी
3. Vindhyāṭavī (No. 28, L. 25): The name appears in one of the verses, quoted from ancient Smṛtis or the Mahābhārata asking people to honour land grants. In the present case it is said that a man who violates the grant is born in the Vindhya forest as a serpent and resides in the dry hollow of a tree.^382 Vindhya forest is the belt of forest at the foot of the Vindhya mountain. Place-names ending in Grāma

ग्राम
Grāma: It means an inhabited place, village, hamlet.^383 It seems that firstly the word grāma denoted the collective inhabitants of a place, community or race. Later on this sense was transferred to an inhabitation and was used in the sense of a village. The earlier usage of this word, which occurs frequently from the Ṛgveda^384 onwards, appears to have been in the sense of a village. The early Āryans must have dwelt in villages which were scattered over the country, some close together, some far apart, and were connected by roads.^385 In the early Vedic literature village is regularly contrasted with the forest (āraṇya) in the evening the cattle regularly returned thither from the forest.^386 The villages were probably open, though perhaps a fort(pur) might on occasion be built inside.^387 Presumably they consisted of detached houses with enclosures, but no details are to be found in Vedic literature. Large villages (mahāgrāmāḥ) were known.^388 The grāma may, however, perhaps be regarded more correctly as an aggregate of several families, not necessarily forming a clan, but only part of a clan (viś), as is often the case at the present day.^389 The head of the village was called Grāmaṇi or ‘the leader of the village’. The king's share in a village is referred to as early as the Atharvaveda.^390 Villages played an important role as a unit of Rāṣṭra or city.^391 Kheṭa was the half of a city and the village was the half of a kheṭa.^392 Cities other than the capital are called Karvaṭa, a little less is Nigama and lesser is grāma and still lesser is a house.^393 Grāma is changed into gaon,^394 as Suvarṇagrāma, Sonārgaon; Kalahagrāma, Kahalgaon. Following are the place-name with this suffix. We have also included here some place-names which are villages though they have not been termed as such with this suffix.

भद्रपुष्करकग्राम
(1) Bhadrapuṣkarakagrāma (No. 40, L. 5): Bhadra means ‘good or auspicious and Puṣkara (modern Pokhara) means ‘a pond or lake’. So literally the name would mean ‘a village possessing an auspicious or good pond’. It has not so far been identified.^395

भारडिदसमद
(2) Bhāraḍidasamada (No. 39, L. 11): It is the name of a village. The name of the place where the liṅga containing the inscription was found is said to be Bhārādhī Ḍīh,^396 Bhāraḍī of our inscription may also be compared with ‘bharaḍiya’ of the Sāñcī stūpa inscription.^397 Samada is possibly Samudra, an epithet for Siva. D.C. Sircar takes ‘Samudra’ to be the ‘nām-aika-deśa of a deity called Samuderśvara’ and suggests that the relevant passage is to be corrected as ‘pārago bharaḍida-samudreśvara’.^398 The meaning of the passage is difficult to explain.

छण्डग्राम
(3) Chaṇḍagrāma (No. 33, L. 3): The village is difficult to identify.^399 Caṇḍa is the Prakritic form of Candra^400 which means ‘the moon’. Thus the village seems to have been named after the Moon-god. But Caṇḍa may also mean ferocious or turbulent and in that case it may have been so named because of its wild looks or its violent population.

चित्रवातङ्गर
(4) Citravātaṅgara^401 (No. 43, L. 24): It is the name of a village. Citra means ‘excellent’ or distinguished^402 and vātaṅgara (from vātaṅkara) means ‘producing wind’. Thus the whole will literally mean ‘which produces excellent wind or air’. The village might have been noted for its healthy and open atmosphere.

दोङ्गाग्राम
(5) Doṅgā-grāma (No. 34, L. 11; No. 36. L. 6): In No. 34 we get a reference to ‘Doṅgā’, but in No. 36, the name appears as Doṅgā-grāma. The Doṅgā-grāma is said to have been situated in HimavacChikhara^403 identified with Barāhachatra (Varāhakṣetra) in Nepal.^404 But scholars^405 are not right in co-relating Doṅgāgrāma with Himavac-Chikhara, Inscription No. 36 clarifies it. There is a long gap between the references to HimavacChikhara and Doṅgā-grāma. Actually Himavac-Chikhara is associated with Kokāmukhasvāmin (a form of the Boar incarnation of Viṣṇu) and Śvetavarāhasvāmin where originally (ādya) these gods were installed in a temple. The name Doṅgā-grāma is used for the place where the lands were donated by Ṛbhupāla for the construction of the two temples having the names of the two deities.^406 The word ‘ādya’ in L. 7 is significant and distinguishes the temples at Himavac-Chikhara from those at Doṅgā-grāma. The writer had to use the word ‘HimavacChikhara’ again in L. 10, with the names of Kokāmukhasvāmin and Śvetavarāhasvāmin in order to avoid confusion between the temples at the two places. For the temple at Doṅgā-grāma the writer uses the word ‘iha’ in L. 11. We also find the word ‘Himavac-Chikhara’ absent in another Dāmodarpur Copper Plate Inscription of the Gupta Year 224 (= A.D. 543), where a person named Amṛtadeva hailing from Ayodhyā donates a land for the repairs and worship, etc., at the temple of Lord Śvetavarāhasvāmin obviously because he was referring to the temple at Doṅgā-grāma and there was now, no question of any confusion or distinction.^407 Thus Doṅgāgrāma does not seem to have any connection with Himavac-Chikhara. This village is to be located somewhere near Dāmodarpur and belonged to the Koṭivarṣa viṣaya as mentioned in the records.^408 But the village was most probably situated in a hilly area which is clear from the wrod Doṅgā itself.^409 The word ‘Atrāraṇye’ (local forest where the temple of Śvetavarāhasvāmin was situated) in No. 37 also attests to it.^410 The village may have consisted of a few huts with bushes and trees all around or the place where the temples were situated was away from habitation. Thus the earlier suggestion that the Koṭivarṣa district included the hilly region bordering on the northern fringe of Bengal,^411 which was rejected by Sircar,^412 seems to be correct.

गोषाटपुञ्जक
6. Goṣāṭapuñjaka (No. 28, L. 2, L. 8, L. 15): In line 2 of the inscription the reading is Goṣāṭapuñjaka while in lines 8 and 15 the reading is Goṣāṭapuñja. Goṣāṭa may be the same as gośālā or a cow-stall^413 and puñja means a multitude.^414 So the village may have consisted of a multitude, of cow-stalls and thus resembled the villages known as gohālīs.

गुल्मगन्धिका
7. Gulmagandhikā (No. 43, LL. 1-2, L. 22): It is the name of a village. It occurs once in lines 1-2 and twice in L. 22.^415 Gulma means ‘a cluster of trees’^416 and gandhikā means ‘having the smell of’.^417 The whole will literally mean ‘a place which is full of a cluster of trees having smell’. We may conjecture that the village originally possessed a few shrubs or small trees which produced fragrance.

गुणेकाग्रहारग्राम
8. Guṇekāgrahāragrāma (No. 52, LL. 18-19, L. 21): In lines 18-19 we get the reading ‘Guṇekāgrahāragrāma while in line 21 the reading is Guṇikāgrahāragrāma. The two names are identical and are the same as modern Gunaighar, 18 miles to the north-west of Comilla, Tippera district<BR> -Bengal, in East Pakistan^418 (now Bangla Desh). Sen considers it to have been a village-name ending with the term agrahāra and suggests that from the standpoint of administration this division was more important and better developed than an ordinary grāma. The expression grāmāgrahāra^419 or agrahāragrāma refers to ‘a process of unification which some of the more fortunate villages underwent through pressure of administrative and economic necessities.^420 Agrahāra (Prakrit aggāhāra) was a village,^421 or consisted of fields which were given to brāhmaṇas.^422 The agrahāras enjoyed exemption from several taxes and had other administrative immunities.

जम्बूदेव
9. Jambūdeva (No. 28, L. 2, LL. 7-8, L. 14): It was the name of a village. It seems that this locality was named after a person named Jambūdeva.^423

ककुभ
10. Kakubha (No. 15, L. 5): Inscription No. 15 informs us that five stone images of Ādikartṛs or Tīrthaṁkaras were set up by Madra at the village of Kakubha. The village was sanetified by its association with holy men.^424 It was also known as Kakubhagrāma,^425 the suffix grāma seems to have been dropped in the present case. Kakubha is identified with modern Kahāum or Kahawan, a village about five miles to the west by south of SalampurMajhauli, the chief town of the Salampur-Majhauli Pargaṇā in the Deoria, Deoriyā or Dewariyā Tehsil or sub-division of the Gorakhpur district in Uttar Pradesh. The grey sandstone column on which the inscription is engraved stands at a short distance on the east of the village.^426

कान्तेडदकग्राम
11. Kānteḍadaka grāma (No. 52, L. 7): It was a village situated in the division called Uttaramaṇḍala.^427 The name cannot be explained but the suffix ‘ḍadaka’ also appears in the name here and Nādaḍadakagrāma mentioned in line 27 of this inscription.

नादडदकग्राम
12. Nādaḍadaka grāma (No. 52, L. 27): It was situated in the Northern direction.^428 The name is difficult to explain.

लवङ्गसिका
13. Lavaṅgasikā (No. 37, L. 15): It is the name of a village based on the Lavaṅga (Clove) tree. Philologically in Lavaṅgasikā one ‘I’ has been dropped: the original and full form should have been ‘Lavaṅgalasikā’ i. e. ‘where Lavaṅga trees play’.

पूर्ण्णनागग्राम
14. Pūrṇṇanāga grāma (No. 40, L. 5): The village belonged to a viṣaya called Kṛmilā in Nālandā, Patna district, Bihar. Literally Pūrṇṇanāga means ‘full of serpents’ and in this respect the name may be compared with the name Kṛmilā of the viṣaya which means ‘full of Kṛmis or worms’.

रेवतिकाग्राम
15. Revatikā-grāma (No. 21, L. 7): The village was situated in Gayā viṣaya.^429 Revatikā is to be identified with Reworu in the Tikari Police area of the Gayā district.^430 It may have been named after a species of plant (the citron tree or cathartocarpus fistula).^431

संगोहलिकग्राम
16. Saṁgohalikagrāma (No. 43, L. 2, L. 20): Saṁgohālika was the name of a village. In L. 2 we get the form Saṁgohāli, while in L. 20, it is mentioned as Saṁgohalikāgrāma.^432 Sircar takes the reading to be ‘Gulmagandhikāgrāma’ in place of Saṁgohālikagrāma.^433 But Saṁgohālikagrāma is the correct form. We can compare Saṁgohāli in L. 2 of this inscription with the letters appearing in L. 20. The first three letters are no doubt not fully legible, but the two remaining are surely ‘lika’. Thus the name can never be Gulmagandhikā, most probably it was Saṁgohālika. Moreover, the context of both the lines 20 and 2 is the same. The word gohālī when joined with the suffix ‘saṁ’ means ‘a good gohālī’. In Inscription No. 28 the word gohālī has in all cases been spelt with long ‘ī’, i. e. gohālī.^434

साटुवनाश्रमक
17. Sāṭuvanāśramaka (No. 37, L. 16): It is the name of a village. The suffixes vana and āśrama are clear but the name cannot be explained due to the word ‘Sāṭu’ the meaning of which is difficult to explain.

वटोदक
18. Vaṭodaka^435 (No. 30, L. 4): It is the name of a village. Vaṭa is probably a Prakritic form of vṛtta meaning ‘surrounded or covered’^436 and the word udaka means ‘water’. So the whole will literally mean ‘a place surrounded by water’. It has been mentioned in the inscription as the abode of good people where lived a person, who bore the distinguished appellation Śrīdeva.^437 Vaṭodaka has been identified with Badoh which is a small village in the Bhilsa district of the old Gwalior State, now in Madhya Pradesh.^438

वायिग्राम
(19) Vāyigrāma (No. 33, L. 9; No. 44, L. 2): It has been identified with Baigram in the Bogra (Bagura) district of Bengal, now in Pakistan.^439 In Inscription No. 44 two localities named Trivṛtā and Śrīgohālī are mentioned as included in Vaigrāma.^440 Vāyi is a Prakritic form of vāyu meaning air or wind and literally Vāyigrāma means ‘a village full of air’. We also know of a town named as Vāyupura.^441 Place-names ending in Pallī

पल्ली
Pallī The suffix<BR> -palli, pallī, pallaka or its diminutive pallikā is derived from §pal to go, to move.^442 It means a small village, (esp.) a settlement of wild tribes (e. g. Triśira-pallī = Trichinopoly).^443 Pallī has been used as meaning a den of thieves in the Uttarādhyanasūtra and other Jain canonical texts,^444 the earliest portions of which are assigned to about 300 B.C.^445 The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra by king Bhojadeva, an eleventh century work, defines Pallī thus: “Where Pulindas^446 live building their huts with leafs, branches and stones etc. is called Pallī and a small Pallī is called Pallīkā”.^447 Its derivation from §pal to go, to move, fits in very well as it was an inhabitation of Ābhīras, thieves and barbarians who moved from one place to another and were usually in small number. It seems to be a Dravidian word loaned in Sanskrit. We find in Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada the word palli meaning hamlet, settlement, small village and in Telugu the words Palli and Palliya denoting ‘a small village’.^448 Pallī^449 is changed into: (a) bal: Āśāpallī, Yessabal (b) Poli, as Triśirapallī (= Trishṇāpallī), Trichinopoly (c) oli, as Ahalyapallī, Ahiroli (also Ahiāri). We have only one place-name ending in this suffix, with a slight variation which is ‘palla’ and is detailed below:

एरण्डपल्ल
Eraṇḍapalla (No. I, L. 19): It is mentioned in the list of countries of Southern region conquered by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Damana. Fleet identifies Eraṇḍapalla with Erandol in the E. Khandesh district of the Bombay Presidency.^450 K.N. Dikshit and Y.R. Gupte agreed with this view.^451 But according to Dubreuil and K.G. Sankar, it is the same as the town Erandpalli near Chicacole on the Coast of Orissa.^452 G. Ramdas opposes Fleet's identification on the ground that Eraṇḍapallī mentioned immediately after the kingdom of Svāmidatta cannot be so far away on the western coast, it must have been in the vicinity of Kaliṅga and Piṣṭapura kingdom.^453 Eraṇḍapallī is mentioned in the Siddhantam plates of Devendravarman of Kaliṅga.^454 Banerjee counts Damana of Eraṇḍapalla among the three chiefs of Kaliṅga who obstructed the passage of Samudragupta through their country.^455 G. Ramdas^456 regards Dubreuil's identification also to be incorrect because Chicacole lies in Kaliṅga which was clearly the country ruled by Svāmidatta. Eraṇḍapallī will have, therefore, to be identified with the village Yendipalli in the Golgonda Taluka of the Vizagapatam district or with the village Eṇḍapalli in Elore Tāluka.^457 But if we suppese that Svāmidatta was the king of Koṭṭūra alone and not of the whole of Kaliṅga, Eraṇḍapallī may well be identified with Chicacole.^458 Palla is the corrupt form of Pallī which means an inhabitation and Eraṇḍa is the castor-oil-plant^459 It seems that the region abounded in eraṇḍa plants. Place-names ending in Gohālī

गोहाली
Gohālī The word gohālī is derived from Sanskrit gośālā which is transformed into goāl in Bengali.^460 It is generally spelt with long ‘ī’ i. e. as gohālī,^461 but in No. 43 it has been spelt with short ‘i’.^462 This suffix has been used with the names of villages. These villages were known as gohālikas,^463 in a similar context the word pradeśa is for villages which were not gohālīs^464 These villages were probably full of cowherds. In Assam such villages are known as goālpāṛā. Following are the place-names with this suffix:

नित्वगोहाली
1. Nitva-gohālī^465 (No. 28. L. 3, L. 9, L. 15): The maning of Nitva is inexplicable.

श्रीगोहाली
2. Śrīgohālī (No. 44, L. 2, L. 8. L. 16): This locality was connected with the village Vāyigrāma, i. e. the present Baigram.^466 The word ‘Śrīgohālī’ means ‘a glorious or beautiful gohālī’. Likewise we have a place name ‘Śrīnagara’ in Kashmir which literally means (a glorious or beautiful city).

वटगोहाली
3. Vaṭa-gohālī (No. 28, L. 2, L. 6, L. 7, L. 12, L. 14): It was a village situated in the Palāśāṭṭa Pārśva within the Nāgiraṭṭa maṇḍala in the Dakṣiṇāṁśaka vīthī. It has been identified with the village of Goālbhīṭā near Pāhāṛpur.^467 Vaṭa is perhaps the Prakritic form of vṛtta meaning ‘surrounded, covered’.^468 The village may have been surrounded by a well or fence. On one hand we find another village named as ‘Trivṛtā’,^469 and on the other Vaṭa-nagara appears as the name of a town and Vaṭodaka as the name of a river.^470 Place-names ending in Pārśvika

पार्श्विक
Pārśvika It means belonging to the side.^471 This suffix signifies the geographical situation of the locality with reference to another place. There is only one name with the suffix, Pārśvika in our inscriptions which is given below:

पलाशाट्टपार्श्विक
Palāśāṭṭa-pārśvika (No. 28, L. 2, L. 12): Palāśāṭṭa may mean ‘an aṭṭa^472 or turret of Palāśa trees’. It is possible that there were many Palāśa trees by the side of a hill and they may have formed a turret on the hill. The locality near such a situation may have been described as Palāṣāṭṭa-pārśvika. Place-names ending in Pāṭaka

पाटक
Pāṭaka Literally meaning ‘a splittler or divider’ it means the half or any part, or a kind of village.^473 Pāṭaka is also the name of a land measure,^474 hence earlier pāṭaka, pāḍaga or pāḍā may have denoted a large but private house, or settlement within a village. Gradually the village and sometimes the city also came to be called after it.^475 There is only one name with this suffix in our inscriptions which is as follows:

स्वच्छन्दपाटक
Svacchandapāṭaka (No. 37, L. 15): Svacchanda in this context may mean uncultivated or wild.^476 So it must be a kind of village with large tracts of barren land. Place-names ending in Pottaka

पोत्तक
Pottaka Pottaka^477 means the site or foundation of a house. It may signify here an inhabitation or locality. We find only one name with the suffix ‘pottaka’ in our inscriptions which is given below:

पृष्ठिमपोत्तक
Pṛṣṭhima-pottaka (No. 28, L. 2, L. 8, L. 14): It seems to be a name based on the goegraphical situation of the place. Pṛṣṭhima literally meaning situated on the backside may here signify ‘a neglected place’. Place-names ending in Vihāra

विहार
Vihāra Literally vihāra means ‘a place of recreation or pleasureground’. With Buddhists or Jains it means a monastery or temple, originally a hall where the monks met or walked about. Afterwards, these halls were used as assembly halls or places of worship. The modern province of Bihar or Behar is so named on account of the large number of Buddhist monasteries in it.^478 We have only one name with the suffix ‘vihāra’ in our inscriptions which is given below:

लोकोत्तरविहार
Lokottaravihāra (No. 32, L. 15): Lokottara vihāra was possibly the proper name of some local Buddhist monastery probably named after the Lokottaravādin sect of the Hīnayāna form of Buddhism. The Buddhist institutions alluded to in this inscription where evidently situated at or in the neighbourhood of Mandasor where the inscription was found, although no place is mentioned in the record.^479 Place-names ending in Kṣetra

क्षेत्र
Kṣetra Originally meaning an agricultural field, in which sense its use survives, kṣetra came to be used as a place-name suffix as we find in the word Kurukṣetra. As a suffix in composition it signified simply a ‘field’ for the word preceding it. For example karma-kṣetra, dharma-kṣetra, raṇa-kṣetra, siddhakṣetra, sureśvarī-kṣetra.^480 The use of this word^481 in the Ṛgveda points clearly to the existence of separate fields^482 carefully measured off,^483 though in some passages the meaning is less definite, indicating cultivated land generally.^484 In the Atharvaveda^485 and later, the sense of a separate field is clearly marked, though the more general use is also found.^486 The deity Kṣetrasya Pati,^487 ‘Lord of the Field’ should probably be understood as the god presiding over each field, just as Vāstoṣpati presides over each dwelling.^488 Kṣetra is changed into:^489 (a) Chatra as Ahikṣetra, Ahichatra (b) Cchatra as Ahikṣetra, Ahicchatra. In Prakrit Kṣetra changes to Kheṭṭa meaning ‘a land for agriculture’, country, village and city, etc.^490 Analogous to Kheṭṭa is the word ‘kheḍa’ or ‘kheṭa’ which means ‘a city surrounded by rivers and mountains’.^491 ‘Kheṭa’ meaning ‘a small hamlet’ is also found in Pāṇini (VI. 2. 126).^492 The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra defines ‘Kheṭa’ as the half of a city and the grāma as the half of a ‘Kheṭa’.^493 According to Monier Williams Kheṭa means a village, residence of peasants and farmers, small town (half of a Pura).^494 Lele^495 considers Kheṭa or Kheṭaka to be the dialectic form of the word ‘Kṣetra’. The original meaning of Kheṭaka or Kheṭa was an enclosure for cattle. In the course of time the pastoral camp grew into an agricultural village, and the word Kheṭaka came to include agricultural village.^496 Here we collect the names of fields appearing in the inscriptions of our study. These names can be attributed to the names of individuals or gods. As the proper names are a part of the names of the fields, we treat them as place-names and do not discuss them in the context of personal-names. Some of the names sound curious and at places the readings are doubtful, the fascimile of the grant supplied by the editor being blurred. It is interesting to note that all these names occur in the same inscription, i. e. Gunaighar Grant of Vainyagupta, year 188 (No. 52). Gunaighar formerly Guṇikāgrahāra,^497 is a village about 18 miles to the north-west of the town of Comilla, a mile and a half to the south west of the P.S. Debidvar in the district of Tippera which is modern Tripur.^498 The area is predominated by Tibeto-Burman tribes. Hence some of the names are full of tribal vocabulary.^499

बुद्धाकक्षेत्र
1. Buddhāka-kṣetra (No. 52, L. 25): Buddhāka seems to be a Prakritic form of Sanskrit Vṛddhārka meaning ‘an old or declining Sun’.^500 A field belongs to a person of this name or else the field was a place of Sunworship.

कालाकक्षेत्र
2. Kālāka-kṣetra (No. 52, L. 25): It is a Prakritic form of Sanskrit Kālārka,^501 i. e. the dreadful Sun at the time of the destruction of the whole world. The field may be connected with Sun-worship. Another alternative is that it was the property of a man with this name.

खण्डविडुग्गुरिकक्षेत्र
3. Khaṇḍaviḍuggurika-kṣetra (No. 52, L. 26): The name is a little puzzling. Its possible Sanskrit form may be ‘khaṇḍavidhugrahika-kṣetra’, i. e. a field belonging to a person who is the owner of house in the shape of half-moon.

जोलारीक्षेत्र
4. Jolārī-kṣetra (No. 52, L. 24): Jolārī seems to be a feminine name. The word Jolā is a Dravidian word meaning a water-course or river.^502 Jolārī may have been a fisher-woman and the field belonged to her.

महिपालक्षेत्र
5. Mahipāla-kṣetra (No. 52, L. 25): This field seems to have belonged to a person named Mahipāla literally meaning ‘a protector of the country’, i. e. a king.

मणिभद्रक्षेत्र
6. Maṇibhadra-kṣetra (No. 52, LL. 26-27): This field belongs to Maṇibhadra literally meaning ‘the excellent jewel’. Maṇibhadra has been the name of a brother of Kubera and king of the Yakṣas (the tutelary deity of travellers and merchants).^503

मिदुविलालक्षेत्र
7. Miduvilāla-kṣetra (No. 52, L. 19): The field belonged to Miduvilāla. The word Midu is a Prakritic form of Sanskrit Mṛdu^504 which means soft, delicate or beautiful. Pāia-Sadda-Mahaṇṇavo^505 takes Vilāla, Birāla, Biḍāla, Bilāḍa and Bilāla as synonymous words meaning ‘a cat’. According to Bhattacharya ‘the word vilāla is evidently derived from vila with its peculiar meaning (a large watery hollow) current in Bengal.^506 D.C. Sircar takes it to be a mechanic caste like vardhaki (carpenter).^507 We find the word Vilāla occurring thrice in the Gunaighar grant (No. 52) which has been translated by the editor of the grant as follows: (a) Miduvilāla-kṣetra (L. 19): The field of Miduvilāla (b) Pakkavilāla-kṣetra (LL. 21-22): The field of Pakkavilāla (c) Gaṇeśvara-Vilāla-Puṣkariṇī (L. 28): the large marshy pond of Gaṇeśvara. All the three names have been explained according to their context in this work. In (a) and (b) the editor takes vilāla as a part of the names Midu and Pakka but in (c) he translates vilāla as ‘a large marshy (place)’. The editor should have taken either Miduvilāla and Pakkavilāla as the adjectives of the fields as in (c) or Vilāla as an adjective of Gaṇeśvara and not that of Puṣkariṇī. Vilāla seems to be a part of the names Midu and Pakka which if left alone yield no meaning, but in the case of Gaṇeśvara vilāla, the word vilāla seems to be an adjective of the name Gaṇeśvara rather than a part of it. Here the word vilāla seems to indicate a professional caste. It is a Dravidian word.^508 The whole sense of the name ‘Miduvilāla’ is not clear.

नखद्दार्च्चरिकक्षेत्र
8. Nakhaddārccarika-kṣetra (No. 52, L. 23): The expression means the field of Nakhaddārccarika. The word Nakhaddārccarika is a puzzle but it can be possibly explained as the worshipper of Nakṣatras, i. e. an astronomer.^509 Nakṣatra changes to nakkhatta^510 in Prakrit. Nakha and ṇakkha are identical,^511 tta in nakkhatta changes to dda in sandhi here. The word ‘arccarika’ means a ‘worshipper’.^512 Stars were regarded as deities to whom regular worship (bhakti) was shown. The names based on stars were unknown in Vedic literature but became popular in the time of Pāṇini and later.^513

नागीजोडाकक्षेत्र
9. Nāgī-joḍāka-kṣetra (No. 52, L. 24): The word Nāgī seems to be a feminine name of the Nāga tribe meaning simply ‘a nāga woman’. The word Joḍāka means a Yugma (two).^514 So the whole will literally mean ‘the field of two Nāgīs’.^515

पक्कविलालक्षेत्र
10. Pakkavilāla-kṣetra (No. 52, LL. 21-22): The expression means field of Pakkavilāla. The word Pakka^516 means a barbarous tribe, a caṇḍāla. Vilāla has already been explained.^517

राजविहारक्षेत्र
11. Rāja-vihāra-kṣetra (No. 52. L. 22): The field belonging to the royal vihāra or monastery. Literally Vihāra means “a place of recreation, pleasure-ground.” With Buddhists or Jains it means a monastery or temple, originally a hall where the monks met or walked about. Bfterwards these halls were used as temples. The province of Bihar ar Behar is also so named because of the number of Buddhist monasteries in it.^518

सूरीनाशीरम्पूर्ण्णेकक्षेत्र
12. Sūrīnāśīrampūrṇṇeka-kṣetra (No. 52, L. 19): The field of Sūrīnāśīrampūrṇṇeka or the Sūrīnāśīrampūrṇṇeka field. The name is inexplicable. 

सूर्य्यक्षेत्र
13. Sūryya-kṣetra (No. 52, L. 25): The field of Sūryya. The field may belong to a person named Sūryya or it may be a place of Sun-worship.

विष्णुवर्धकिक्षेत्र
14. Viṣṇuvardhaki-kṣetra (No. 52, L. 19): The field of Viṣṇuvardhaki. Viṣṇu is the first part of the name based on god Viṣṇu. The second part of his name seems to be dropped and instead his professional epithet ‘vardhakin’ has been added which means ‘a carpenter’.^519 In Sāñcī Stūpa Inscriptions we get the word ‘vaḍakina’ which is the same as Sanskrit ‘vardhakin’ and means ‘carpenter’.^520 In the Aṅgavijjā,^521 we get the word ‘vaṭṭaki’ which denotes a metal worker.

वैद्यक्षेत्र
15. Vaidya-kṣetra (No. 52, L. 22): The field of Vaidya, i. e. a physician.

यज्ञरातक्षेत्र
16. Yajñarāta-kṣetra (No. 52, L. 27): The field of Yajñarāta. Yajña means sacrifice or worship and rāta means ‘given’ presented, bestowed’.^522 The whole will literally mean ‘given by Yajña’. The field may be a place of worship or sacrifice. Because of the performance of Yajña on a certain occasion the field came to be so named as if it was a permanent place of sacrifice or the field might have been named after a person ‘Yajñarāta’. Place-names ending in Puṣkariṇī

पुष्करिणी
Puṣkariṇī Puṣkara means a blue lotus so Puṣkariṇī denotes a lotus pool. It also means a lake or pool in general.^523 The names of some localities associated with pokharās or tanks have survived to modern times. Following are the place-names with this suffix:

दण्डपुष्किणी
1. Daṇḍa-Puṣkiṇī (No. 52, L. 31): Though the reading is Daṇḍapuṣkiṇī, it is to be corrected as Daṇḍa-puṣkariṇī.^524 Daṇḍa meaning punishment or rod seems to be a personal name here and the puṣkariṇī was named after him or else it may have been in his possession.

दोषीभोगपुष्करिणी
2. Doṣī-bhoga-puṣkariṇī (No. 52, L. 20): Doṣī may stand for Sanskrit jyotiṣi meaning astrologer.^525 Bhoga may be a personal name, thus the name may stand for a pond of the astrologer named Bhoga. Another possibility is that bhoga signifies enjoyment. In that case the expression will signify a pond in the possession of an astrologer.^526

गणेश्वरवितालपुष्करिणी
3. Gaṇeśvara-vitāla-puṣkariṇī (No. 52, L. 28): Gaṇeśvara was the name of the person to whom the puṣkariṇī belonged. Vilāla is a professional epithet which denotes a mechanic caste^527 or it may have been the nick-name of the person.^528 Following are the place-names which have got no suffix with them. One-word Place-names

अवमुक्त
1. Avamukta (No. 1, L. 19): The Inscription No. 1 refers to Avamukta as one of the countries in Dakṣiṇāpatha subdued by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Nīlarāja.^529. Avamukta has not been identified with certainty. Some scholars on the basis of the similarity of names identify it with Avimukta another name of Kāśī.^530 But the suggestion cannot be accepted. Avamukta of the inscription was a country in the South while Avimukta or Kāśī is an eastern country. It may be considered to be situated in the Godavari district.^531 According to D.B. Diskalkar it must lay on the Eastern Ghāṭs which lie to the west of Kāñcī or Conjeevaram.^532

दवाक
2. Davāka (No. 1, L. 22): It has been mentioned as one of the frontier states subdued by Samudragupta. According to Fleet it was the ancient name of Dacca.^533 V.A. Smith takes it as corresponding to Bogra, Dinajpur and Rajshahi districts.^531 But as these districts were not actually incorporated in the Gupta dominions, D.R. Bhandarkar suggests that Ḍavāka corresponds to the hill-tract of Chittagong and Tippera.^535 K. L. Barua identifieds it with Kopili valley in Assam.^536 Generally Ḍavāka is identified with modern Daboka in Nowgong district, Assam.^537 It thus corresponds to the valley of the Kapili and the Yamuna rivers in Nawgong district where we still find a place called Doboka.^538

कामरूप
3. Kāmarūpa (No. I, L. 22): It has been mentioned as one of the frontier states which were subordi nate to Samudragupta and whose emperors paid him taxes and all kinds of obeisance. Majumdar^539 identifies it with Upper Assam. Kāmarūpa consisted of the Western districts of the Brahmaputra valley which being the most powerful state and being the first to be approached from the western side came to denote the whole valley.^540 The area of Kāmarūpa was estimated by the Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang to have been 10,000 li i. e. 1667 miles in circuit which shows that it must have comprised the whole valley of Brahmaputra.^541 Śaktisaṅgama describes^542 Kāmarūpa as extending from Kāleśvara to the Śvetagiri and from Tripura to the Nīla-parvata (which is the Nilādri or Nīlakūṭa, the name of the Kāmākhyā hill). According to the Yoginī Tantra, the kingdom of Kāmarūpa included the whole of the Brahmaputra valley together with Rangpur and Cochbihar.^543 The Purāṇas mention Prāgjyotiṣa, identified with Kāmākhyā or Gauhati, as the capital of Kāmarūpa.^544 The Kamauli grant of Vaidyadeva mentions Kāmarūpa as a Maṇḍala of the Prāgjyotiṣa-bhukti.^545 The Abhidhāna, the Vaijayantī and the Trikāṇḍaśeṣa inform us that Prāgjyotiṣa and Kāmarūpa were the same country.^546 In the Raghuvaṁśa,^547 the separate mention of Prāgjyotiṣa and Kāmarūpa may seem to be a little puzzling. But we see that whereas verses 81-82 of the fourth canto refer to the king of Prāgjyotiṣa as terrified, the subsequent verses describe the presentation of elephants and the offer of respects by the king of Kāmarūpa to Raghu. Thus all the four verses are inter-linked and, the context also proves that Prāgjyotiṣa and Kāmarūpa were the same.^548 The Buddhist Chronicle Ārya-mañjuśrī-mūlakalpa describes Kāmarūpa as a country of the east.^549 The Bṛhatsaṁhitā^550 and the Kāvyamīmāṁsā^551 also mention it in the same direction. Chatterji remarks that the tribes living on the frontiers of Kāmarūpa were akin to the Man tribes of South-Western China, a wild Tibeto-Chinese people.^552 The Ahoms of the Shan Tribe came into Assam at the beginning of the 13th century due to the break-up of the Chinese empire by the Moguls and ruled till the British occupation in the beginning of the 19th century.^553

काञ्ची
4. Kāñcī (No. I, L. 19): The earliest epigraphic mention of Kāñcī is to be found in this inscription. The inscription refers to Viṣṇugopa of Kāñcī as one of the kings of Dakṣiṇāpatha defeated by Samudragupta but reinstated in their kingdoms. Kāñcī is the same as Kāñcīpura or modern Conjeevaram in the Chingleput district of Madras Presidency.^554 The kingdom of Kāñcī extended from the mouth of the Krishna to the south of the river Palar and sometimes even to the Kaveri.^555 It is also known as Kāñcīpeḍu.^556 It is mentioned in several early records relating to the ancient history of the Pallavas of Kāñcī (of about A.D. 250 to 355)^557 The Aihole inscription of Pulakeśin, the Cālukya ruler in the 7th century A.D. refers to his conquest of Kāñcīpura.^558 The earliest literary reference to Kāñcī is in the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali.^559 The Mahābhāṣya on Vārttika 26 to Pāṇini IV. 2. 104 mentions Kāñcīpuraka (i. e. a resident of Kāñcīpura).^560 Hiuen Tsang informs us that Kāñcī was 30 li or 5 miles in circuit, and that in the city there were eighty Deva temples and many hereties called Nirgranthas.^561 The Purāṇas attach great importance to Kāñcī.^562 It is included in a list of seven holy cities of India.^563 The Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa^564 associates Kāñcī with Kāśī, the two forming the two eyes of Śiva. It is stated in the Bārhaspatya sūtra^565 that Kāñcī is a Śākta-kṣetra. In the Devībhāgavata^566, Kāñcī is said to be a sthāna of the Devī called Annapūrṇā.^567 The Vāmana Purāṇa^568 mentions it as the best among the cities. The Skandapurāṇa^569 counts it amongst the holy places. The Bhāgavatapurāṇa^570 and the Yoginītantra^571 also mention it. In Daśakumāracaritam^572 it is referred to as a city of the Drāviḍa country. Kāñcī is full of temples and shrines. Śiva Kāñcī and Viṣṇu Kāñcī form the western and eastern parts of the city, while the Jaina Kāñcī is known as Tiruparutti-Kunram.^573 Of the temples at Conjeevaram, the most famous are the Kāmākṣī temple with a Cakra placed in front of the deity, the Vaikuṇṭha Perumal temple of Viṣṇu and the Śhiva temple of Kailāśanātha.^574 Apart from its religious significance Kāñcī has been a famous centre of learning. The Pallava ruler Mahendravarman, the author of the Mattavilāsa-Prahasana; Bhāravi, the author of the Kirātārjunīyam and Daṇḍin, the author of the Daśakumāracaritam are said to have flourished here.^575 The famous Buddhist dialectician Dinnāga came here to satisfy his intellectual and spiritual thirst and about the middle of the fourth century A.D., the brāhmaṇa Mayūraśaraman, who founded the Kadamba line came here for getting recognition in Vedic learning.^576 The Ādi-guru Śaṅkarācārya established here the famous Pīṭha known as Kāmakotipīṭha.^577 Literally Kāñcī means a ‘girdle’. It seems to have been so named because it is situated like a girdle round the sea.

काशी
5. Kāśī (No. 28, L. 6): It is mentioned in Inscription No. 28. According to the inscription a vihāra at Vaṭa-gohālī was inhabited by the disciples of the Nigrantha preceptor (Śramaṇācārya) Guhanandin, belonging to the Pañca-stūpa section (nikāya) of Kāśī.^578 Evidently Vaṭagohālī was a seat of Jain monks who had their major seat at Kāśī. The name Kāśī is derived from the root Kaś ‘to shine’. The Skandapurāṇa^579 says that the city of Kāśī became famous by that name because it sheds light on (the way to) nirvāṇa or because, that indescribable refulgence, viz. god Śiva shines forth here.^580 B.C. Law connects it with Ti-miao meaning ‘read sprouts’, a Chinese translation of the word and this links it with a certain kind of grass.^581 It has been known for centuries under five different names, viz., Vārāṇasī (modern Banaras), Kāśī, Avimukta, Ānandakānana and Śmaśāna or Mahāśmaśāna.^582 The earliest mention of the Kāśīs as a tribal people occurs in the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda.^583 Vārāṇasī was the capital of the people of Kāśī.^584 Thus it seems that geographically Kāśī represented a larger area than Vārāṇasī, the latter being the capital of the former. But in medieval times the position became just the reverse. Vārāṇasī comprehended the entire district and Kāśī generally represented only a small place. In a grant of Mahārāja Vināyakapāla we get a reference to a village of Tikkarikā situated in the Pratiṣṭhāna-bhukti, and attached to Kāśī-pāra-Pathaka which belonged to Vārāṇasī viṣaya.^585 Kāśī pāra-pathaka represented the site of the ancient city of the Kāśī.^586 The Vividhatīrthakalpa^587 also mentions Kāśī as a janapada in the Vārāṇasī City. The ancient kingdom of Kāśī was bounded by Kośala on the north, Magadha on the east, and Vatsa on the west. The Cedis and Karuṣas lived to their south.^588 At the time of Buddha, the kingdom of Kāśī was absorbed by the kingdom of Kośala.^589 We know that Lord Buddha gave his first discourse near Kāśī in the Deer Park at Sārnāth. Kāśī was an important Buddhist centre and was a seat of monastic establishments in the time of Aśoka.^590 During the period of Gupta rule it was on its way to become a strong centre of Śiva worship with the mahāliṅgas set up in different parts of the city.^591 The Purāṇas include the region in the Gupta empire.^592 It was a great centre of trade and commerce. Patañjali in his Mahābhāṣya^593 mentions Kāśī cloth. The Buddhist literature gives us many accounts of the merchants of the city.^594 Kāśī has been a place of much improtance for Hindu pilgrimage. Its religious importance has been discussed at length in the Kāśīkhaṇḍa of the Skanda Purāṇa. Lord Śiva never leaves it, hence it is known as Avimukta. A man who dies here is believed to get emancipation.^595

कोसल
6. Kosala (No. 1, L. 19): It is spelt both ways with the dental as well as with the palatal sibilant. It is included in the list of the Dakṣiṇāpatha kingdoms whose kings were conquered but reinstated by Samudragupta. At that time Mahendra was its ruler. It has been identified with South Kosala corresponding to modern district of Raipur, Sambalpur and Bilaspur of M.P. and Orissa.^596 Its old capital was Śrīpura (modern Sirpur), 40 miles north-east of Raipur.^597 It is the same as Mahā-kosala^598 which forms the largest unit among the three component parts of the State of Madhya Pradesh.^599 The recent excavation at Eraṇ has thrown a flood of new light on the early history of eastern Malwa and Mahākosala between the period 1900 B.C. and A.D. 600. During the Gupta period several Brahmanical temples were built in this region. In the early medieval period i. e. from A.D. 600 to 1200, the Candellas and Kalacuris were the two chief ruling dynasties in the Mahākosala area. In the period of Muslim rule followed by Maratha supremacy, many forts and fortresses were built by the ruling chiefs^600 in different parts of Mahākosala. Dakṣiṇa Kosala is mentioned in the Ratnāvalī (Act IV) as having been conquered by Udayana, king of Vatsa.^601 N.L. Dey^602 identifies Dakṣiṇa Kosala with Tosalī of Aśoka's inscription (Tosala) at Dhauli, which is situated near Bhuvaneśwar in the Puri district, Orissa. Sylvain Levi suggests an Austric origin for this wold. ‘Kosala changing to Tosala is an apparent variation of the initial due to the formative prefix’^603 in the Austric languages. The country of Tosala also, like Kosala, had two divisions: Uttara Tosala and Dakṣiṇa Tosala.^604 Dakṣiṇa Tosala consisted of a maṇḍala of the name of Koṅgoda. In some cases by mistake the reading Dakṣiṇa kosala is given in place of Dakṣiṇa Tosala.^605 But it is clear from other evidence that Tosala and Kosala were two separate entities. The purāṇas mention them separately.^606 The Kāvyamīmāṁṣā also makes a separate reference to the two.^607

कोट्टूर
7. Koṭṭūra (No. 1, L. 19): It is mentioned as one of the Southern kingdoms conquered by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Svāmidatta. It has been identified by N. Dubreuil with Kothoor in Ganjam.^608 Banerjee counts Svāmidatta of Koṭṭūra among the three chiefs of Kaliṅga who obstructed the passage of Samudragupta through their country.^609 According to Fleet Koṭṭūr (from Koṭṭapura) being a very common Dravidian name, may be looked for in any Koṭṭūra of note, in a mountainous part of Southern India, e. g. possibly Koṭṭūr in the Coimbatore district, at the foot of one of the passes in the Anaimalai Hills.^610 R. Sathianathaier proposes to identify Koṭṭūra with Koṭṭūra near Tuni (E. Godavari district) and maintains that Samudragupta did not pass through Orissa, Ganjam and Vizagapatam^611 There is another Koṭṭūra in the Vizagapatam district.^612 But the generally accepted view is to indentify it with Kothoor in Ganjam.

कुराल
8. Kurāla (No. I, L. 19): It has been mentioned as one of the kingdoms of Dakṣiṇāpatha subdued by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Maṇṭarāja. Fleet suggests that Kaurālaka is a mistake for Kairalaka, denoting the well known province Kerala in the South of India.^613 D.R. Bhandarkar^614 identifies this Kerala with the Sonpur territory in C.P. round about Yayātinagara where the author of the Pavanadūta locates the Keralas. Barnett identified it with modern village Korāḍa in South India.^615 Kurāḷa is taken by Kielhorn^616 to be the same as Kunāla mentioned in the Aihole inscription of Pulakeśin II^617 and identified with the Kolleru lake between the Godavari and the Krishna.^618 But D.R. Bhandarkar^619 objects to this view on the ground that the Kolleru lake must have been included in the kingdom of Veṅgī mentioned later on^620 in the same list in the inscription. G. Ramdas^621 seems to be right when he observes that Kurāḷa must be the plain country of the Ganjam district to the north-east of the Mahendra hill now chiefly occupied by the Oriyas.

नेपाल
9. Nepāla (No. I, L. 22): It is mentioned as one of the border states which accepted the subordination of Samudragupta. Some take it to refer to Tippera^622 which is doubtful.^623 The city is said to have been founded by Ne ṛṣi who performed his religious services at the junction of the Bāgmatī and Kesāvatī and who also ruled over the country.^624 The Nepāla valley originally contained a lake called Nāga Bāsa or Kālihrada, in which lived Nāga Karkoṭaka. It was fourteen miles in length and four miles in breadth^625 The former name of Nepāla was Śleṣmātakavana.^626 The famous temple of Paśupatinātha on the western bank of the Bāgmatī river, is situated about three miles north west of Kathmandu in the town of Devipatan said to have been founded by Aśoka's daughter Cārumatī.^627 The Śaktisaṅgama Tantra describes the country of Nepāla as placed between Jaṭeśvara and Yoginī.^628 Sircar equates Yoginīpura with Delhi and Jaṭeśvara with Jalpeśvara, the famous Śiva of the Jalpaiguri district in North Bengal.^629 Nepāla was a buffer state in the 7th century A.D. In the 8th century A.D. she shook of its domination by Tibet.^630 According to the Deopara inscription, Nānyadeva, the ruler of Nepāla, is said to have been defeated and imprisoned with many other princes by Vijayasena, about the middle of the 12th century A.D.^631

10. Palakka (No. I, L. 20): It has been mentioned as one of the kingdoms of Southern India whose kings were first conquered and then released by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Ugrasena. Palakka has been identified with Palakkaḍa, the capital of a Pallava viceroyalty and was situated in the Nellore district.^632 Law is inclined to identify Palakkaḍa with Palakalūru in the Guntur taluka.^633 Allan and G. Ramdas locate it in the Nellore district.^634 Smith places Palakka in the Nellore district.^635 Dubreuil, however, identifies Palakka with a capital of the same name which was situated to the South of the Krishna and which is mentioned in many Pallava Copper Plates.^636 The kingdom of Palakka might have extended westwards beyond the region now occupied by the districts of Auddepal and North Arcot.^637 It was perhaps situated to the west of Kāñcī on the Eastern Ghāṭs.^638

प्रत्यन्त
11. Pratyanta (No. 1, L. 22): It is mentioned in Inscription No. 1 that the kings of frontier (or border) states ‘Samataṭa, Ḍavāka, Kāmarūpa, Nepāla and Kartṛpura’ gratified the imperious commands of Samudrgupta, by giving all (kinds of) taxes and obeying (his) orders and coming to perform obeisance.^639 We also find a reference to Pratyanta in the Girnar Rock Edict No. 2. of Aśoka.^640 Law^641 contrasts between Āryāvarta and Pratyanta. He takes Pratyanta to mean the Mleccha country and quotes the Amarakośa, Divyāvadāna, Abhidhānacintāmaṇi and Smṛticandrikā.^642 But in the inscription^643 the contrast is between Dakṣināpatha and Āryāvarta while the word Āṭavikarāja breaks the link between Āryāvarta and Pratyanta. Moreover, all the border states mentioned in the inscription could not have been Mleccha and inhabited by Kirātas.^644 The word Pratyanta and its substitutes in the Aśokan edicts also refer to the frontier states.

समतट
12. Samataṭa (No. 1, L. 22): It is one of the frontier kingdoms which offered their submission to Samudragupta.^645 Sen^646 remarks that Samudragupta reduced the king of Samataṭa to the rank of a subordinate prince who had to part with most of his powers and was ‘allowed to rule over a much reduced dominion as a vassal of the emperor’. Retaining only the control of its internal administration, he had to pay various kinds of taxes to Samudragupta, attend his durbars, render obeisance to him and gratify his imperious commands.^647 Samataṭa is the only territory in Bengal to be referred to in the Allahabed Praśasti.^648 The first epigraphic reference to Samataṭa is to be found in this inscription.^649 Literally the name means ‘the shore country’ or ‘Level country’.^650 ‘Samataṭa in the Gupta period denoted a territory lying to the east of the Brahmaputra’. The Bṛhatsaṁhitā mentions it as a country situated in the East.^651 The Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang proceeded from Kāmarūpa southwards and after a journey of 1,200 or 1,300 li (6 li1 mile) reached the country of Samataṭa. According to him, this country was on the seaside and was low and moist and was more than 3,000 li in circuit.^652 From Samataṭa, the pilgrim journeyed towards the West for over 900 li and reached Tanmolihti,^653 or Tāmralipta, the modern Tamluk in the Midnāpur district.^654 Samataṭa, therefore, must have been the South-eastern part of the Bengal presidency corresponding to the Dacca, Faridpur, Backerganj, Jessore and Khulna districts.^655 It is known from the Baghaura Inscription^656 that the Tipperah district was in Samataṭa. The Ārya-Mañjuśrī Mūlakalpa states that Samataṭa was situated to the east of the Lohitya.^657 The Yādavaprakāśa equates Bhaurika with Samataṭa.^658 Epigraphical evidence, however, shows that Samataṭa comprised the districts of Comilla, Noakhali and Sylhat.^659 Its capital Karmmanta has been identified with Baḍ-Kāmatā, 12 miles west of Comilla district.^660 After the rule of the Guptas, Samataṭa was successively under the Khaḍga, Candra, Varman and Sena dynasties.^661

वेङ्गी
13. Veṅgī (No. 1, L. 20): Inscription No. 1 mentions it with its king Hastivarmman who was subjugated by Samudragupta. It seems to be an abbreviated form of Veṅgīpura by dropping the suffix Pura.^662 It is identified with Vegī or Peḍḍa-vegī, a village near Ellore Taluka between the Krishna and the Godavari rivers.^663 Banerjee describes it as one of the Pallava kingdoms of South.^664 But the capital of the Pallavas was Kāñcī. Veṅgī was the capital of the Cālukyan kings^665 and was also known as Vengai-nāḍu.^666 NAMES OF LOCALITIES

अवडर
1. Avaḍara (No. 46, L. 10): Kaivartti-śreṣṭhin is mentioned as the resident of Avaḍara.^667 Avaḍara is the only geographical name mentioned in the inscription. It appears to have been a locality near modern Supia, in Old Rewah State, from where the inscription has been found. The name is difficult to explain.

हिमवच्छिखर
2. Himavacchikhara (No. 36, L. 5, L. 10): Literally meaning ‘the peak of the Himalayas’ it has been identified with Barāhachatra (Varāhakṣetra) in Nepal,^668 which is the same as the Kokāmukha tīrtha mentioned in the Mahābhārata and the Purāṇas.^669 The original temples of the gods Kokāmukha and Śvetavarāha referred to in the record^670 along with Himavac-Chikhara, were situated at this place.^671

नष्टी
3. Naṣṭī (No. 5, LL. 4-5): The second part of the word is not legible. It seems to have been the name of a town in the Sukuli deśa. The meaning of the word is not clear. It must have been a place near Sāñcī in the Madhya Pradesh.

पञ्चकुल्यवापक
4. Pañcakulyavāpaka (No. 37, L. 16): The Dāmodarpur Copper Plate Inscription of the time of Bhānugupta (No. 37) records that one kulyavāpa of land was purchased to the north of Pañcakulyavāpaka. Literally it means ‘a plot of land five kulyavāpas in area: It seems to refer to a village or locality comprising five kulyavāpas of land.^672 A kulyavāpa is ‘an area of land requiring one kulya measure of seed grains to be sown’.^673 This land measure differed in different ages and localities. Maity^674 gives this area of five kulyavāpas in terms of modern measurements as follows: 5 kulyavāpas = 1 pāṭaka = 192-240 bighās = 72-88 acres and believes the lower figures to be more correct.

परस्पतिका
5. Paraspatikā (No. 37, L. 16): It seems to be the name of a locality. The metathesis of two letters ‘s’ and ‘p’ seems to have worked here. Its correct Sanskrit form should have been ‘Parapastikā’. The word ‘prapasti’ means a house, habitation or abode.^675

त्रिवृता
6. Trivṛtā (No. 44, L. 2, L. 8, L. 15): In L. 2, two localities named Trivṛtā and Śrīgohālī have been mentioned as connected with the village named Vāyigrāma.^676 Literally it means ‘surrounded or covered by three sides’. It seems that when the locality was founded the city was surrounded by some natural boundary on its three sides. This may have been in the form of rivulets or streams or hillocks. TRIBAL PLACE-NAMES Following are the place-names which have tribal associations without any mention of the specific boundary:

आर्यावर्त्त
1. Āryāvartta (No. 1, L. 12): Samudragupta is stated to have violently exterminated many kings of Āryāvarta such as Rudradeva, Matila, Nāgadatta, Candravarman, Gaṇapatināga, Nāgasena, Acyuta, Nandin and Balavarman.^677 We also find references to Āryāvarta in other epigraphic records.^678 Literally Āryāvarta^679 means ‘the abode of the Āryas, or excellent or noble people’. The word ‘Ārya’ here is significant. It has been interpreted in two ways: some scholars derive the word Ārya from the root §Ar, to plough, and suggest that the Vedic Āryans were so called because they despised the pursuits of agriculture and remained shepherds and hunters.^680 “If Ārya were purely a racial term. a more probable derivation would be Ar, meaning strength or valour, from §ar to fight, whence we have the name of the Greek war-god Ares, areios, brave or warlike, perhaps even arete, virtue signifying, like the Latin virtues, first physical strength and courage and then moral force and elevation”.^681 “Intrinsically, in its most fundamental sense, Ārya means an effort or an uprising or overcoming. The Āryan is he who strives and overcomes all outside him and within him that stands opposed to the human advance.”^682 Wilson says that a variety of ancient designations of which ‘Āria’ is a component element (cf. Ariāna) are connected with the term Ārya. The Zend name for the country to the west of the Indus was ‘Eriene-veejo’, that is the Sanskrit Āryāvarta.^683 In defining the boundaries of Āryāvarta, Vasiṣṭha and Baudhāyana in their Dharmasūtras lay stress on the word Ārya and explain it to mean śiṣṭa. Patañjali also in his Mahā bhāṣya first explains the meaning of śiṣṭa in order to draw attention to the cultural basis of the name Āryāvarta. He remarks that correct conduct is found in Āryāvarta and then mentions its boundaries.^684 In the Brāhmaṇa period the centre of Āryan culture and civilization shifted to the Gangetic Doab “Āryāvarta came to be treated as conterminous with the region between the Gaṅgā and Yamunā.^685 In the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka^686 special honour is assigned to those who dwell between the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā. In the Śutra period Āryāvarta extended from the hills of Central Rajasthan to the hills of Central Bihar.^687 At the time of Patañjali,^688 Āryāvarta was bounded on the north by the Himalayas, on the south by Pāriyātraka, on the west by Ādarśāvalī and on the east by Kālakavana (Rajmahal hills) ‘Black Forest’ or rather Kanakhala, near Hardwar.^689 Thus it seems that Āryāvarta bore a sacerdotal sense and denoted a particularly limited area where Āryan institutions were the basis of social order.^690 What was originally called Āryāvarta was later named as Madhya-deśa and Āryāvarta came to include the whole of Northern India. This is related to the gradual spread of Āryanism.^691 Brahmāvarta and Brahmarṣideśa lost their identity in the Madhya-deśa and combined with Prācya, Pratīcya and Udīcya (Uttarāpatha) became the equivalent of Āryāvarta.^692 Both Udīcya and Prācya were taken as the home (loka) of standard Sanskrit both in Pāṇini's time and earlier. In the time of Patañjali, Āryāvarta came to be regarded as the home of the Śiṣṭas (persons proficient in the Śāstras) whose language set the norm.^693 By the second century A.D., the last limit of the composition of the Manu-smṛti, the wider outlook of Āryāvarta was popular. It was the name of the tract extending from the Eastern to the Western Ocean, and bounded on the north and south by the Himalaya and Vindhya respectively.^694 This is supported by the Kāvyamīmāṁsā of Rājaśekhara.^695 Rājaśekhara speaks of the river Narmadā as the dividing line between Āryāvarta and the Dakṣiṇāpatha.^696 In Inscription No. 1, L. 29 Āryāvarta is contrasted with Dakṣiṇāpatha, ‘the southern region’.^697 The wider sense of Āryāvarta is also supported by references in the Abhidhāna-cintāmaṇi^698 and the Rājataraṅgiṇī.^699

काकनादबोट
2. Kākanādaboṭa (No. 5, L. 1; No. 23, L. 2): In both the inscriptions, we find reference to a grant to the Ārya Saṁgha or the Community of the faithful, at the great Vihāra, or Buddhist convent of Kākanādaboṭa,^700 for the purpose of feeding mendicants and maintaining lamps. D.C. Sircar takes ‘Kākanādaboṭa’ to be the old name of Sāñcī.^701 Fleet is of the view that the Kākanādaboṭa convent is the Great Stūpa itself. According to him the word Boṭa is another form of Poṭa which means ‘the foundation of a house’.^702 Fleet further writes that the name ‘Kākanāda’ lit. ‘the noise of the crow’ was the ancient name of Sāñcī itself which is proved by its occurrence in two inscriptions in Mauryan characters found at Sāñcī.^703 Thus, it is clear that Kākanāda was the ancient name of Sāñcī in the Bhopal State, now Raisen district, Madhya Pradesh, well-known for its Buddhist topes.^704 The word ‘boṭa’ is thus a surplus and joined by ‘Kākanāda’ will refer to the great stūpa itself. Its form Poṭa meaning the foundation of a house is untenable because the word ‘vihāra’ in that very sense appears in the inscriptions. The word ‘boṭa’ has been used here in the sense of an ascetic cult.^705 It is a Prakrit word which has been used here to refer to ‘the Buddhist cult’. Thus the relevant expression means ‘in the holy great vihāra of the Buddhist cult (assembly) at Kākanāda’. Fleet is wrong in translating the word Kākanāda to mean ‘the noise of the crow’.^706 K.P. Jayaswal's rendering ‘the praise of the Kākas’^707 is more to the point. We know of the Kākas, an autonomous community mentioned in the Allahabad Inscription of Samudragupta.^708 In Eastern Malwa we have two ancient place-names connected with the Kākas. One is the hill now called Sāñcī hill (the ancient) Kākanāda. The other is an ancient village called Kāka-pura, some 20 miles north of Bhilsa, and full of ancient monuments.^709

उत्तरकुरु
3. Uttara Kuru (No. 22, L. 7): A person named Śaṁkara is described in the inscription as born in the region of the north, the best of countries, which resembles (in beautitude) the land of the Northern Kurus.^710 The Kurus had two branches, the northern and the southern. Uttarakuru or the country of the Northern Kurus, is supposed to be a region beyond the most northern range of the Himālaya mountains, and is described as a country of everlasing happiness.^711 We have discussed in details, the Kurus, in the section on tribes. The Bṛhatsaṁhitā^712 mentions it as a country situated in the North. In the later period the Uttarakurus had only a mythical or legendary existence.

वङ्ग
4. Vaṅga (No. 20, L. I): In this inscription, king Candra, “on whose arm fame was inscribed by the sword, when in battle in Vaṅga countries, is stated to have kneaded, back with his breast the enemies who, uniting together, came against him”.^713 This is taken by scholars^714 to be the first epigraphic mention of Vaṅga. The Vaṅgas here mean the ‘Vaṅga country’ the eastern Bengal of modern times. Bajpai is of the opinion that the Vaṅgas of the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription of Candra (No. 20) are the people living in the Makaran coast of Baluchistan.^715 But the Vaṅgas here denote country and not the people. Moreover, the victory of king Candra over the Vaṅga countries has no connection with his conquest of the Vāhlikas. Both are separately mentioned in his campaign. In Sanskrit the tribal name in the plural is regularly used to indicate the country inhabited by the tribe.^716 The Vaṅga countries are also referred to in the Mahākūṭa Pillar Inscription,^717 but in the inscriptions after the 9th century A.D. the word Vaṅgāla is usually mentioned.^718 The earliest mention of the Vaṅgas along with the Magadhas is in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka.^719 The name is also found in the Baudhāyana Dharma-Sūtra^720 where the Vaṅgas are mentioned as impure people.^721 But the Drama ‘Pratijñā-Yaugandharāyaṇa’ (Act II), ascribed to Bhāsa and probably not older than the 4th century A.D., suggests that the ruling families of Bengal were regarded as equals to those of Northern India for intermarriage with the royal family of Mālava.^722 The people of Vaṅga are stated to have fought in the Kurukshetra war^723 and, in course of his expedition Bhīṣma is said to have defeated Samudrasena of Vaṅga.^724 The Kāśikā mentions Vāṅgaka to explain Pāṇini's sūtra (IV. 3. 100) denoting loyalty of the citizen to the state.^725 Pāṇini mentions Vāṅgī (the lady of Vaṅga Janapada) along with Avantī, Kurū and Yaudheyī.^726 Patañjali also refers to the Vaṅgas by way of illustration.^727 Kauṭilya makes similar references to the country.^728 The Bhāgavata Purāṇa also mentions it as a country.^729 Kālidāsa states that Raghu after conquering the Sumhas,^730 defeated the Vaṅgas with his force.^731 The Kāvyamīmāṁsā mentions Vaṅga as a janapada situated in the east.^732 The Bṛhatsaṁhitā also mentions it in the east along with UpaVaṅga.^733 According to the Mahābhārata^734 Vaṅga, son of Bali, had establishad this country. The Amarakośa^735 mentions Vaṅga as a synonym of Raṅga (lead), but lead is not available in Bengal and is found in abundance in Malaya, Pegu and East Indies. People in other parts of India may have received lead through the people of East Bengal. Suśruta also uses Vaṅga in the same sense as Amara does^736 R.C. Banerji^737, on the basis of the Ablur Inscription of the Kalacuri king Bijjala^738 takes Vaṅga and Vaṅgāla as two distinct people or tribes. This view has been correctly refuted by S.B. Chaudhuri^739 who concludes that Vaṅgāla was within Vaṅga and hence was not altogether a separate geographical entity as is maintained by some. The confusion may be due to the fact that the geographical location of the Vaṅga country changed in different periods. The same country Vaṅga was known as Vaṅgāla with the addition of the Prakrit suffix ‘āla’^740 which was transliterated by the Muslims as Bangālah (pronouncing Bangāla) in their script^741 and this was changed into Bengal by the English people. The Yādavaprakāśa equates Vaṅga with Harikeli^742 but the Kalpadrukośa, a work of the seventeenth century states that Śrīhaṭṭa is Harikeli.^743 The commentary of Yaśodhara on the Kāmasūtra refers to Vaṅga as situated to the east of the Brahmaputra.^744

गङ्गा
1. Gaṅgā (No. 1, L. 31, No. 13, L. 16): In Inscription No. 1 Samudragupta's fame has been compared with the pale yellow water of the river Gaṅgā, which travelling by many paths, purifies the three worlds, flowing quickly on being liberated from confinement in the thickets of the matted hair of (the) god Paśupati.^1 In the Mandasor inscription of Yaśodharman and Viṣṇuvardhana^2 it is stated that when the river Gaṅgā was about to descend from heaven to earth, in order to break the force of its fall, god Śiva (Paśupati) received it in the matted hair coiled above his forehead and projecting like a horn; its waters wandered there for a thousand years, before they eventually reached the earth. In Inscription No. 13, we get a reference to Gaṅgā in the context of Skandagupta's fight with the Hūṇas, the noise of which was heard like the roaring of (the river) Gaṅgā, making itself noticed in their ears.^3 A.C. Woolner^4 remarked that the name Gaṅgā does not seem to have a convincing derivation on the Āryan side. But we do find the word in the Uṇādi affixes. The affix Gan comes after the root Gaṁ ‘to go’ and the word Gaṅgā is formed.^5 The earliest mention of Gaṅgā is in the Ṛgveda.^6 The name also occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa^7 and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.^8 We find it also in Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya,^9 and in Kālidāsa's Raghuvaṁśa.^10 It is mentioned many times in the Purāṇas^11 in which a good deal of religious importance is attached to it.^12 The Gaṅgā emerges first in the Gangotri in the district of Garhwal and proceeds in different courses from Hardwar to Bulandshahar and from Allahabad to Rajmahal from where it enters Bengal.^13

हचातगङ्ग
2. Hacāta Gaṅga (No. 52, L. 31): We find the mention of Hacāta Gaṅga in inscription No. 52, but it is difficult to identify it. It may, however, be remarked here that the word Gaṅga is to be taken in the sense of a river.^14

जम्बूनदी
3. Jambūnadī (No. 37, L. 17): Sen considers it to be the name of a river.^15 It has been described as the name of one of the seven arms of the heavenly Gaṅgā.^16 We also know of a Jambūnadī as a vīthī in the Gayā Viṣaya mentioned in the Nālandā plate of Dharmapāladeva.^17

कालिन्दी
4. Kālindī (No. 18 L. 3): According to the inscription in the reign of Budhagupta, his feudatory, Mahārāja Suraśmicandra was governing the country lying between the river Kālindī and Narmadā.^18 Kālindī is the same as the river Yamunā.^19 The Yamunā has got its source from the Kalindadeśa, a mountainous country situated in the Bāndarapuccha range or the Himālaya and hence the river is called Kālindī.^20 In the Purāṇas we get the earlier mention of Kālindī by both the names, Kālindī as well as Yamunā.^21 The Kālindī is also mentioned in the Śiśupālavadha of Māga.^22

नर्मदा
5. Narmadā (No. 18, L. 3): The above-mentioned inscription describes reign of Mahārāja Suraśmicandra, a feudatory of Budhagupta, as governing over the area between the rivers Kālindī and Narmadā.^23 This is one of the earliest inscriptional references to the river Narmadā.^24 It is mentioned as Narmados by Ptolemy.^25 No express reference to the Narmadā can be traced in the Vedic literature. But the knowledge of the river is implied in the reference to a chief Revottaras mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.^26 We find from the Amarakośa^27 that Revā is another name of the river Narmadā. It is likely that the name of the chief was derived from his association with the river.^28 The Raghuvaṁśa speaks of Mahiṣmatī as the capital of Anūpa on the bank of the Revā (i. e. Narmadā).^29 It has been mentioned several times in the Mahābhārata and the Purāṇas.^30 The Viṣṇupurāṇa says that by chanting a mantra addressed to the Narmadā, one does not have any fear from serpents.^31 The river rises in the Amarakaṇṭaka mountain and falls into the Gulf of Cambay. The junction of the Narmadā with the sea is a sacred place of pilgrimage.^32 According to the Purāṇas it flows from a Ṛkṣvat (a part of the Vindhyan range) though some of them refer to it arising directly from the Vindhya itself.^33 It is stated in the Kūrma and Matsya Purāṇas that a man who commits suicide at any tīrtha on the Narmadā or on the Amarakaṇṭaka does not return to this world.^34 Several rivers such as Kapilā, Viśalyā, Eraṇḍī, Ikṣunadī and Kāverī^35 are mentioned as falling into the Narmadā.

पद्मा
6. Padmā (No. 16, L. 5): The inscription No. 16 refers to a brāhmaṇa named Devaviṣṇu, who belonged to the community of Caturvedins of Padmā of the town of Indrapura.^36 The Gaṅgā is also known as Padmā or Paddā.^37 The community of the brāhmaṇas mentioned in the inscription might have lived by the side of the river. D.C. Sircar takes Padmā to be the name of a locality in the town of Indrapura.^38 The inscription (No. 16) also tells us that Skandagupta's feudatory viṣayapati Śarvanāga was governing Antarvedi or the country lying between the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā.^39

पलाशिनी
7. Palāśinī^40 (No. 14, L. 16): This river Palāśinī issues from the mountain Raivataka. On account of the flood it had swollen. The poet, in describing the scene says that the river had gone to join the sea. Palāśinī is described as emanating from the mountain Ūrjayat (i. e. the same as Raivataka).^41 We find another Palāśinī, (mod. Parās), a tributary of the Koel in Choṭānagpur.^42 It seems that the river was decorated with numerous Palāśa (flower) trees that grew on its banks. The flowers falling in the river must have given it the name of Palāśinī.^43

सिकता
8. Sikatā^44 (No. 14, L. 16): The river Sikatā takes its source from the mountain Raivataka. It is the same as Suvarṇa-sikatā mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradāman.^45 This Sikatā or Suvarṇasikatā is to be identified with modern Soṇarekhā.^46 The name Suvaṇṇarehā (Suvarṇarekhā) is also met with in Vividhatīrthakalpa.^47 Thus the first part of the river's name has remained unchanged for about two thousand years. The second part has been replaced by a new one. The exact derivative as suggested by Chatterji will be a form like Sonasītā or Sonasī.^48 The river was named Suvarṇasikatā because its sand contains particles of gold.^49

सिन्धु
9. Sindhu (No. 20, L. 2): The river is mentioned in connexion with the description of the victories of king Candra who is said to have conquered the Vāhlikas after having crossed the seven mouths of the (river) Sindhu^50 in warfare. Sindhu in the Ṛgveda^51 and the Atharvaveda^52 often means simply a ‘stream’. The Ṛgveda (VIII. 24. 27) refers to ‘Sapta Sindhavaḥ’ or ‘the seven rivers’.^53 But it is also^54 used in the more exact sense of the ‘stream’ par excellence or ‘The Indus’. We get a reference to Sindhu as a river in the Amara-kośa.^55 The territories adjoining it were famous for horses^56 and salt.^57 The term Sindhu was corrupted to Hindu in the old Persian inscriptions of Darius I (516-485 B.C.), and to Indus by the Ionian (= Pāṇini's Yavana) Greeks.^58 The word ‘India’ is derived from the river Sindhu or the Indus.^59 Taking its rise from the snows of Western Kailāśa in Tibet, the Sindhu first flows north-west of Kashmir and South of little Pamir, and then takes a southward course along which lay some of the important cities of north India. Emerging from the Darad high-lands, the river (Dāradī Sindhuḥ) enters the Gandhāra country until it receives its most important western tributary the Kabul river at Ohind, a few miles north of Attock.^60 The river Sindhu is mentioned in the Purāṇas along with the Gaṅgā, Sarasvatī, Satluj, Chinab and Yamunā.^61 Vogel suggests that the expression ‘Sindhor sapta mukhāni’ may indicate the ‘sapta sindhavaḥ’ of the Ṛgveda, i. e. the river Indus and its tributaries. The term mukha would then be not taken in the sense of ‘the mouth of a river’, but as meaning a river-head.^62 But the translation of the expression as done by Fleet (i. e. the seven mouths of the river Indus) is generally accepted.^63 The seven mouths of the river Indus thus represent the points of its confluence with its tributaries and not the tributaries individually as suggested by Vogel.

सुदर्शन
10. Sudarśana (No. 14, L. 15: L. 17): It is the name of a lake situated at some distance from Girinagara as mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradāman I (A.D. 150).^64 The lake was originally constructed by the Vaiśya Puṣyagupta, the provincial governor of the Maurya king Candragupta. Later on during the reign of Aśoka it was adorned with conduits, by the Yavana governor Tuṣāspha.^65 The same lake was destroyed by the excessive floods in the Suvarṇasikatā, Palāśinī and other streams arising from the mountain Ūrjayat.^66 By a breach, four hundred and twenty cubits long, just as much broad, (and) seventy-five cubits deep, all the water flowed out, so that, the lake, almost like a sandy desert became extremely ugly to look at.^67 The lake was immediately beatufied with repairs by king Rudradāman.^68 Inscription No. 14 informs us that during the reign of Gupta king Skandagupta in the year 136 (G. E.), due to heavy continous rains the Sudarśana lake burst out on all sides^69 and had the appearance of a sea. Eventually, contrary to the literal meaning of its name the Sudarśana became ugly to look at.^70 The lake was reparied in the year 137 (G. E.)^71 (= A.D. 456) by Cakrapālita, who was appointed governor of Girinagara by his father Parṇadatta, who was Skandagupta's viceroy in Surāṣṭra.^72

11. Vāṭā-nadī (No. 43, L. 22): We get a reference to the Vāṭā-nadī in an inscription at Kalaikuri, Sultānpur near Naogaon, Rajshahi district, East Pakistan now Bangla Desh. It was flowing to the east of a village named Dhānyapāṭalikā. ‘The Vāṭā nadī appears to be the modern Bārā-nai, Singra lying about 10 miles to the north-east of its junction with the Atrai.^73 It flows west to east through the southern part of the Rajshahi district^74

विलासिनी
12. Vilāsinī^75 (No. 14, L. 16): The river comes out from the mountain Raivataka. Fleet takes Sikatāvilāsinī as an adjective of the Palāśinī^76 but the three, Sikatā, Vilāsinī and Palāśinī seem to be separate rivers as we find the use of the plural number in the case which denotes the mention of more than two rivers. Hence Vilāsinī is the third river in the context: the other two being Pilāśinī and Sikatā (Suvarṇasikatā). THE MOUNTAINS

कैलाश
1. Kailāśa (No. 17, L. 6: L. 13): In L. 6 of the inscription the poet while giving an account of the city of Daśapura describes its buildings as lofty like the mountain Kailāśa itself.^77 L. 13 describes the mountain Kāilaśa as one of the breasts of the earth (the other being Sumeru) which was being reigned over by the Gupta king Kumāragupta.^78 Kailāśa mountain is situated about 25 miles to the north of Māna-sarovara beyond Gangrī and to the east of the Niti Pass.^79 The Mahābhārata^80 includes the Kumaun and Garhwal mountains in the Kailāśa range. The mountain also known as Hemakūṭa, Śaṁkaragiri and is to be identified with the Aṣṭapada mountain of the Jainas.^81 It surpasses in beauty the big Gurlā or any other of the Indian Himālaya.^82 Traditionally it is supposed to be the habitat of Śiva and Pārvatī.^83

2. Raivataka (No. 14, L. 16) (the same as Ūrajayat see Ūrjayat): Raivataka is also mentioned in the Ādi-Parvan of the Mahābhārata,^84 the Vividhatīrthakalpa,^85 the Bṛhatsaṁhitā,^86 the Dohad Stone Inscription of Mahamūda,^87 and the Jaunpur Inscription of Iśānavarman.^88 Its modern name Girnar was a switch over to it from the city name Girinagara, i. e., ‘a city on or at the foot of a hill’.^89 Raivataka derives its name from king Revatā, the father of Revatī, (the wife of Baladeva, Kṛṣṇa's elder brother).^90 Revata is supposed to have come there from Dwārakā and lived on the hill. There is still a tank called Revatī-kuṇḍa near Dāmodarakuṇḍa in the gorge of the hill.^91 The Gujarati Sanskrit poet Māgha in the Śiśupālavadha devotes the whole of Canto IV (verses 1-68) to the description of the Raivataka mountain. In Canto VI (verses 1-79) the poet describes the occurrence of six seasons one by one at the mountain Raivataka.

3. Sumeru (No. 17, L. 13, No. 32, L. 15): In No. 17 the mountain Sumeru is described as one of the breasts of the earth (the other being Kailāśa) and the Gupta king Kumāragupta is mentioned as the lord of the earth. In No. 32 it has been named as Amarabhūdhara. Its other names are Meru, Karṇikācala, Ratnasānu, Svargiri, Svargigiri and Kāñcanagiri.^92 Sumeru is identified with Rudra Himālaya in Garhwal, where the river Gaṅgā has its source, it is near Badarikāśrama.^93 According to the Matsya Purāṇa^94 the Sumeru Parvata is bounded on the north by Uttara-Kuru, on the South by Bhāratavarṣa, on the west by Ketumāla and on the east by Bhadrāśvavarṣa.^95 It is also mentioned in the Padmapurāṇa.^96 and the Kālikāpurāṇa.^97 According to the Kālikāpurāṇa Śiva saw the summit of it. We also learn from this text that the Jambu river flows from this mountain.^98 We also find the mention of the Meru in the Śiśupālavadha of Māgha. It was on account of the eminence of Sumeru among the mountains that for praising kings they were described as ‘Meru’ among kings.^99 This metaphor may have been applied after the contention of the Purāṇas that the earth is supposed to be like lotus, with four Mahādvīpas as its four petals and mount Meru as its pericarp.^100

4. Ūrjayat (No. 14, L. 16): The poet here draws a picture: the lake Sudarśana looked like the sea^101 and the rivers Palāśinī, (Suvarṇasikatā), etc., had joined it has if the mountain Ūrjayat had stretched his hand with flowers (growing on the banks of the trees and thus falling in the rivers) for sending his daughters to their worthy husband.^102 Since the rivers emerged out from the mountain Raivataka, it may be called their father as described in verse 28, but to avoid repetition the poet uses in verse 29 a synonym of its name viz., the Ūrjayat and while making it the symbal of father represents the sea as the husband of the rivers.^103 Thus the mountains Ūrjayat and the Raivataka are one and the same. We also get support for our suggestion from the fact that whereas the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradāman describes the emergence of the rivers Palāśinī, Suvarṇsikatā etc., from the mountain Ūrjayat^104 in Inscription No. 14 the name of Raivataka is used in the same context.^105 Fleet^106 and Sircar^107 are wrong in describing Raivataka as a hill different from Ūrjayat or Girnar situated opposite to it. The Vividhatīrthakalpa also uses the names Raivataka and the Ujjayant (Ūrjayat) as synonyms for Girinara which was sanctified by Śrīnemi and is situated in Surāṣṭra (South Kathiawad).^108 In another inscription at Girnār (about 15th century) verses 5-8 refer to the mountain Girnār by both the names Ujjayanata and Raivata.^109 The Abhidhānacintāmaṇi of Hemacandra also mentions Ujjayanta and Raivataka as synonyms.^110 The Kap copper-plate of Keṭadi Sadāśiva-Nāyaka also refers to Ujjantagiri (Ūrjayat).^111 The mountain Ūrjayat is identified with Girnar hill near Junāgaṛh.^112 The literal meaning of Ūrjayat is strong, powerful, eminent.^113

विष्णुपद
5. Viṣṇupada (No. 20, L. 6): We know from the inscription that a lofty standard of the divine Viṣṇu was set up on the hill called Viṣṇupada.^114 Literally meaning ‘the hill marked with footprints of Viṣṇu’, Viṣṇupada hill has been identified with that part of the Delhi Ridge on which the column stands.^115 But there is no mountain in Delhi and the inscription appears to have been brought there from the mount Viṣṇupada.^116 On the evidence from the Epics, this Viṣṇupada hill is not far from Kurukshetra and the Beas.^117
