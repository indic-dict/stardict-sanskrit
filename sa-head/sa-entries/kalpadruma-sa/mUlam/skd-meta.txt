This file describes the coding conventions of skd.txt and skd-title.txt.
This file is encoded in utf-8 encoding.


The original digitization is file skd_orig.txt, which is
coded in the cp1252 (windows 1252) encoding,
and is best viewed in a text editor which supports this encoding.
For example, in Emacs, one may use the command
revert-buffer-with-coding-system
and then select cp1252 as the coding.
The internet reference http://www.cp1252.com/ describes this coding system.

The file skd_orig_utf8.txt is a conversion of skd_orig.txt to the
more common utf-8 encoding.
(Nov 20, 2014) skd_orig_utf8_slp1.txt uses SLP1 transliteration.
               skd_v0.txt contains only the body of the dictionary; the
               other lines of skd_orig_utf8_slp1.txt are in skd-preface.txt.
               skd_v0.txt contains the dictionary body; it also removes
               coding of 'nuktas'.
The file skd.txt is also in the utf-8 encoding, and incorporates various
editing changes, such as corrections of typographical errors. 

There are several extended ascii codes in skd.txt.
£  (\u00a3)    24 := POUND SIGN
¤  (\u00a4)    12 := CURRENCY SIGN
¯  (\u00af)     3 := MACRON
×  (\u00d7)     4 := MULTIPLICATION SIGN
‘  (\u2018)  1398 := LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
’  (\u2019)  1350 := RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
“  (\u201c) 53143 := LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
”  (\u201d) 52825 := RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
„  (\u201e)     3 := DOUBLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK
†  (\u2020)     1 := DAGGER
‡  (\u2021)     1 := DOUBLE DAGGER

The {X...X} style of coding serves minor purposes in skd.txt:
{%n%}  2 : italic 
{??}  111  : unreadable text
   Sep 25, 2014.  all but 11 of these corrected by Sampada Savardekar.
{el2} 3 :  A two-dot ellipsis
{el3} 259: A three-dot ellipsis
{Picture} 4:  The text has a picture or diagram here.

The following  <x> type tags are found in skd.txt:
<HI>  42248  : At beginning of line, indicating start of headword
<P>  1130  : At start of line, indicating a paragraph indentation
<H>  161  : At start of line. A 'headline' (various usage)
<>  442480  :  At beginning of other 'normal' lines
<F>..</F>  5  : Footnotes
<om/>     100+ : Sep 26, 2014.  This is added to skd_orig_utf8_slp1.txt,
      and flows through to skd.txt.  It is not present in skd_orig.txt.
      It represents the Devanagari 'OM' symbol.
      Nov 20, 2014. Removed.  Now the OM symbol is coded as o~.
The rest are 'Column' indicators for textual tabular arrays
<C10>  24  : 
<C11>  12  : 
<C1>  921  : 
<C2>  926  : 
<C3>  824  : 
<C4>  825  : 
<C5>  789  : 
<C6>  55  : 
<C7>  46  : 
<C8>  46  : 
<C9>  42  : 


Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded as
[Page5-069-b+ 52] Volume 5, Page 069, column b (2nd col.), 52 lines in column.
Some variants of the '-b' part of this occur, for example
 [Page2-268+ 41] , where the usual 3-column form is broken by a table.
 [Page2-048-a1+ 13] , where  again a tabular display is shown.

The headwords are ordered according to Sanskrit alphabet ordering.
However, about 2% of the identified headwords are out of alphabetical order.

The introduction is not coded in skd.txt; it appears in the separate file
skd-title.txt.  The page breaks are coded as
[Page0-xxxETC] so that 0-xxx is as in file pdftitlefiles.txt, which
gives the correspondence to scanned image pages in skd_title.pdf.


Sanskrit in the text appears in Devanagari, and is coded in skd.txt
with the KH (Kyoto-Harvard) coding, with two variants::
 MM codes chandra-bindu
 D2 codes the normal KH 'D' (retroflex soft unaspirated 'd') 
    which in the devanagari of the text is printed with an under-dot (nukta). 
    Similarly 'D2h' codes the aspirated character.  There are also many
    occurrences of 'D' and 'Dh' without the under-dot.

Headwords are also coded in HK.  
Nov 20, 2014
 Devanagari coded as SLP1, with two variants in skd_orig_utf8_slp1.txt:
 oMM is coded as o~
 Other MM is coded as M~
 Also, nuktas are recoded as : D.h, D., l. -> Q2, q2, and l2
 In skd_v0.txt, the 'nukta' is dropped:  
   Q2, q2 and l2 are changed to Q, q and l. (no dot after 'l')
   
 Headwords also coded in SLP1.

There is no Anglicized Sanskrit coding in skd.txt.
There is no AS coding in skd.txt.


Scanned images (in pdfs skd_title, skd1_bookmark, ..., skd5_bookmark) are
almost all from http://archive.org downloads
sabdakalpadrumah01devauoft.pdf, ..., sabdakalpadrumah05devauoft.pdf.
However, a few (12) pages missing from these downloads were obtained from
the high-resolution scans used for digitization (ejf).
